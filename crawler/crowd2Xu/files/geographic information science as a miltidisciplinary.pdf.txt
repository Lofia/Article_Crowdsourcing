                                                  (Received 1 October 2013; accepted 13 March 2014)

                   Despite the fact that the ﬁeld of GIScience has been around for two decades, there is still little agreement as to the exact
                   contents and boundaries of the ﬁeld. Many authors have dedicated several publications concerned with deﬁning the ﬁeld,
                   yet little consensus has been reached. Because of the highly dynamic nature of the discipline, new areas are constantly

                   added and rigid borders may have a constraining inﬂuence on the ﬁeld. On the contrary, one agreed part of the many
                   GIScience deﬁnitions is the search for general principles, but principles for what? Can we deﬁne one ﬁeld or discipline or
                   all potential ﬁelds using geospatial information? Probably not. Therefore, rather than attempting to demarcate exact
                   boundaries for GIScience as a discipline or a multidisciplinary ﬁeld in order to prove its respectability, we herein attempt
                   to analyze the contents of such a dynamic ﬁeld on the basis of scientiﬁc literature and to assess the multidisciplinary and
                   multiparadigmatic nature of GIScience. Such a discussion is not purely of academic nature, but also bears implications
                   beyond academic discourse, in terms of external scientiﬁc funding and research grants. We question whether there is a

                   “dominant” paradigmatic approach in GIScience and identify a need for adopting a multiparadigmatic view to accommo-
                   date the multifaceted nature of space, spatial representations, and the societal implications of geospatial information.

            GIScience: a multiparadigmatic ﬁeld (or an own                   Attempting to position GIScience as an own scientiﬁc
            scientiﬁc discipline)?                                           discipline

            Why is this discussion – discipline versus sub-discipline        Adherence to key criteria central to a scientiﬁc discipline
            versus multidisciplinary ﬁeld – relevant at all? According       Reitsma (2013) examined a number of criteria, which an

            to Reitsma (2013), it is important to justify the ﬁeld of        increasing number of philosophers of science agree on as
            GIScience as a science in order to receive funding from          being central to demarcating science, in the context of
            agencies. She states that funding agencies favor “hard”          GIScience research. Such key criteria include, for

            sciences, which work with empirical methods and produce          instance, simplicity, predictive accuracy, coherence with
            substantial results, as opposed to “soft” sciences, whose        known facts, as well as testability (Stamos 2007).
            contribution is often not sufﬁciently recognized (Reitsma            Reitsma (2013) concludes that GIScience may well

            2013). Furthermore, Wright, Goodchild, and Proctor               pass as a science, if deﬁned on the basis of the key-criteria
            (1997) argue that the term “science” is often used syno-         identiﬁed by Stamos (2007), as it contains signiﬁcant
                                                                             aspects of most criteria. However, she goes on to mention
            nymously with the term “research” and that it therefore
            functions as a “crude but convenient shorthand for aca-          that it is difﬁcult to deﬁne a science based on a small list
            demic legitimacy” (Wright, Goodchild, and Proctor 1997,          of criteria, since there may well be further noteworthy

            354). Reitsma (2013) also points out that underpinning the       criteria to be considered such as the generality of results
            label of science leads to more credibility for arguments or      (Reitsma 2013). She also notes that GIScience does not
            evidence gained within a ﬁeld and, therefore, states that        study the world as such, in contrast to most other sciences,

            there may well be good reason for “a bit of scientiﬁc            but rather studies representations of the world in terms of
            gerrymandering” (Reitsma 2013, 219) in order to include          geographic information and considers the procedures

                Given that there seems to be no clear demarcation of         ing such information. Therefore, she concludes that
            science itself, placing GIScience under the umbrella term        GIScience cannot exist independently from other sciences,
            of science is a difﬁcult task and can be approached in           but rather “It exists in symbiosis with other disciplines,
