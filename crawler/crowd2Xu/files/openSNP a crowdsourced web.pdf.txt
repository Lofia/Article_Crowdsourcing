    Abstract

    Genome-Wide Association Studies are widely used to correlate phenotypic traits with genetic variants. These studies usually

    compare the genetic variation between two groups to single out certain Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) that are
    linked to a phenotypic variation in one of the groups. However, it is necessary to have a large enough sample size to find
    statistically significant correlations. Direct-To-Consumer (DTC) genetic testing can supply additional data: DTC-companies
    offer the analysis of a large amount of SNPs for an individual at low cost without the need to consult a physician or

    geneticist. Over 100,000 people have already been genotyped through Direct-To-Consumer genetic testing companies.
    However, this data is not public for a variety of reasons and thus cannot be used in research. It seems reasonable to create a
    central open data repository for such data. Here we present the web platform openSNP, an open database which allows

    participants of Direct-To-Consumer genetic testing to publish their genetic data at no cost along with phenotypic
    information. Through this crowdsourced effort of collecting genetic and phenotypic information, openSNP has become a
    resource for a wide area of studies, including Genome-Wide Association Studies. openSNP is hosted at http://www.opensnp.
    org, and the code is released under MIT-license at http://github.com/gedankenstuecke/snpr.
