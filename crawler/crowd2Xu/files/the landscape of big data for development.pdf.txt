Executive Summary

This report summarizes the current landscape of big data for development , considering in particular data
exhaust (e.g. cell phone records), online activity (e.g. social media), sensing technologies (e.g.▯ satellite data), and

crowdsourced information. It reviews the major big data research initiatives over the past few years and discusses
the role of the private sector, academia, multilateral institutions, foundations, donor agencies, and ▯NGOs in these

projects. The report relies on a comprehensive review of both the peer-reviewed and grey literature, followed by
a series of interviews with researchers working in the big data for development field, each of whom reviewed and

provided feedback on the draft.

The use of big data in development is largely being driven by opportunistic partnerships between private
companies and academics. Data exhaust is often owned by the private sect▯or, especially mobile phone operators.

Online activity, sensing data, and crowdsourced information are often publicly accessible, but the size and
complexity of these data sets requires specialized analytical skills. Because of this, and because big data ▯analytics
are still in a nascent phase methodologically, academics currently have a high degree of influence in how big

data is actually utilized. Some of these academics work in-house for tel▯ecommunications and IT firms, but most
are in public and private university systems. Multilateral institutions, e▯specially UN Global Pulse, play a key role in

publicizing the potential role of big data in development. Foundations fund big data research through a variety of
financing streams, and have been important in creating forums where big data researchers can exchange ideas

and data sets. The current landscape of big data is, overall, less the result of agenda setting by a small group of
politically and economically powerful institutions than it is the unplanned aggregate of diverse projects focusing on

those aspects of big data analytics that are methodologically and legally tractable.
Mobile phone call detail records dominate the category of data exhaust, and researchers have focused on how

this information can be used to make inferences about human mobility patterns, social network structure, and
socioeconomic welfare. Mobility research, for example, has helped to trace transmission patterns of epidemic

disease, especially malaria and cholera. Satellite data on environmental and infrastructural variables is the
most common type of sensing information, used to map spatiotemporal patterns of illness risk and economic

development. Twitter feeds and Google searches are the dominant types of online activity data, and are most
commonly used as early warning systems for epidemics and more recently for “sentiment analysis” of users — a

snapshot of psychological states, reactions to events, and cultural attitudes. NGOs have generally taken th▯e lead in
implementing crowdsourcing applications in humanitarian emergencies, and multilateral institut▯ions have done the

same in development.
Contrary to popular perception, big data is not a replacement for traditional data systems. In fact, in the short-term

big data projects will need to rely on complementary “ground-truthing” data from traditional sources in order to
assess the nature and magnitude of bias in big data sets. Such validation procedures are necessary for end-users

of the data, including policymakers, to interpret the contextual meaning of big data across cultures and economies.
In addition, big data sets are  not by virtue of their size exempt from the conventional requirements of good

theoretical and statistical practice, including careful problem identification, model construction, and hypothesis
testing.











1The phrase “big data for development” is used broadly here; the focus is not only on developing world data sets, but also on projects that have the potential
to be applied to developing world issues pertaining to human development.

Introduction: How Big Data Development Research is Different

This report summarizes the current landscape of big data for development. It reviews the major big data research
initiatives over the past few years and discusses the role of the private sector, academia, multilateral institutions,

foundations, donor agencies, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in these projects.

Following this introduction, each of the subsequent four sections looks at a different type of big data: data exhaust,
online activity, sensing technologies, and crowdsourcing .Data exhaust is information passively generated by

the use of digital technology, for example cell phones. Online activity encompasses all forms of Internet use, but
current research is focused on social media, especially Twitter, and search activity, especially through Google.

Sensing technologies conventionally refer to data-gathering satellites and Global Positioning System (GPS)-▯enabled
devices, although a variety of newly invented personal sensors are gathering information on social behavior

and environmental conditions. In contrast to the other three types of data, which require little active engagement
between user and researcher, crowdsourcing applications actively solicit the knowledge of a wide user base on ▯
particular topics or events. The fifth section of the report briefly discusses non-research actors that have been

critical in advancing the big data research agenda, especially foundations and donor agencies.

Big data research differs in several aspects from other areas of development. Most of the data used in traditional
development research rests with those who have generated it, most commonly government statistical agencies,

multilateral databanks, and a few specialized NGOs. Academics generally ▯work with either large-scale data sets
controlled by these public and non-profit entities or with smaller data sets they generate themselves speci▯fically for

research purposes. Additionally, with the rise of randomized controlled trials and other research designs aimed at
feeding more directly into the policy process, partnerships between academics and governments are becoming
more common. Data generated by the private sector has been to date a relatively small contributor to development

research.

The use of big data, in contrast, is largely being driven by opportunistic partnerships between private companies
and academics. Data exhaust is often owned by the private sector, especially mobile phone operators, although

legal privacy requirements constrain the ability of the companies to share the data freely. Remote sensing, online
activity, and crowdsourced information are often publicly available, but the size and complexity of these data

sets require specialized analytical skills. Because of this, and because big data a▯nalytics are still in a nascent
phase with little methodological consensus, academics currently have a high degree of influence in how big data

is actually utilized. Some of these academics work in-house for telecomm▯unications and IT firms, but most are in
public and private university systems.

This is not to say that traditional players do not exercise influence. Multilateral institutions like UN Global Pulse
have had an important role in marketing the potential of big data for development and initiatin▯g research initiatives

of their own, in Global Pulse’s case leveraging the unique reach of the UN system. The United Nations Children’s
Fund (UNICEF) in particular has launched several innovative social media and crowdsourcing pilot projects.

Private foundations (especially), government donor agencies, and development banks are, as in other areas of
development, the primary funding source for big data research initiatives. However, mainly because big data

has no objective definitional boundaries, this money is often not earmarked for “big data research” specifically,
appearing rather under a range of funding portfolios. After years of skepticism, donor interest in big data for

development has increased greatly in the past two years, and for the first time funding for large-▯scale projects – not
simply proofs of concept – appears to be on the horizon.

The current landscape of big data is thus less the result of agenda setting by a small group of politically and
economically powerful institutions than it is the unplanned aggregate of diverse projects focusing on those aspects

of big data analytics that are methodologically and legally tractable. For example, mobile phone call▯ detail records


 2Big data does not have a consensus definition. These categories were originally proposed in the UN Global Pulse (2012) report “Big Data for Development: Chal-
lenges and Opportunities”, written by Emmanuel Letouzé. They are used to narrow the scope of this report to the most relevant current applications of big data to the
gender data gap.



www.data2x.org                                                        1
dominate the category of data exhaust, and researchers have focused on how this information can be used to
make inferences about human mobility patterns and socioeconomic welfare. Satellite data on environmental and

infrastructural variables is the most common type of sensing information, used to map spatiotemporal patterns of
illness risk and economic development. Twitter feeds and Google searches are the dominant types of online activity
data, and they are most commonly used as early warning systems for epidemics and more recently for “sentiment

analysis” of users — a snapshot of psychological states, reactions to events, and cultural attitudes. Crowdsourcing
is an exception: NGOs and multilateral institutions have driven most crowdsourcing projects.

In sum, in most applications of big data for development the research agenda has been built by individual
researchers slowly forming thematic communities, for example around “digital epidemiology” public health research

done using cell phone records and social media as the primary data sources. The main challenge in doing big
data research well is the same challenge that currently confronts more traditional areas of science: collaboration
between disciplines, in the particular case of big data between computer scientists, statisticians, and▯ technical

specialists in health, economics, education, and so on. An additional co▯nsideration in the development realm,
often ignored because big data is seemingly distant from field implementation of programs, is the place-based

knowledge that is necessary for not only interpretation but also effective utilization of big data by policymakers and
program officers. For example, health surveillance data from online activity may provide a uniquely rich picture of
spatial and temporal morbidity trends, but using this information productively depends on local decision-makers

and health professionals understanding and trusting the analytical results.

Thus much of the ineffective use of big data – and the (growing) resistance that results from such ineffective
use – stems from a lack of sufficient collaboration, manifest especially in the application of innov▯ative computing
techniques that unfortunately may not be grounded in contextual knowledge of a place, strong technical

understanding of the disciplinary problem, or statistical considerations of accuracy, bias, and precision. In the
academic world, this is changing rapidly as collaborative networks strengthen and more big data research enters
the peer-reviewed literature and is subject to closer scrutiny; this report profiles some of the best examples of

rigorous, policy-relevant big data research for development. Much, however, remains to be done in linking big data
research results to real-world policy and program processes.

The sections that follow are not comprehensive, but rather highlight the most well-known projects and major
research themes in the categories mentioned above, and the involvement of the ▯various types of development

actors in each.

    A. Data Exhaust
    Data exhaust refers to the “digital footprints” left by behavior — passively ▯generated, digital information related

    to phone calls, transactions, and the like. At present, data arising from mobile phone use is the most frequently
    studied form of data exhaust.

        1. Mobile Phone

        The major source of data exhaust in the developing world is, and will continue to be f▯or the near future,
        mobile phone Call Detail Records (CDRs) and airtime expense records. Call Detail Records provide data
        on anonymized caller and receiver phone IDs, the start and end times of calls, call duration, and the

        location of the caller and receiver (as determined by the location of the closest cell tower). Information on
        SMS and multimedia content sent is also available. Airtime expense records contain data on the amount of

        purchase, the time of purchase, existing balance, the phone user’s ID, and the nearest tower location at the
        time of purchase (UN Global Pulse 2013e).

        The overall goal is behavioral inference (Eagle 2008). By tracing the social, spatial, and temporal patter▯ns
        of use, researchers can study a variety of behavioral phenomena, ranging from human and disease mobility

        patterns, socioeconomic welfare, and the structure of social networks. A few examples of innovative and

 “Machine learning”, a topic within artificial intelligence, refers to the study and development of computer systems that can recognize and learn from
patterns within datasets without explicit step-by-step instruction by programmers.

(Gutierrez et al. 2013). Johan Bollen’s group at Indiana University has investigated how mobile records
illuminate geographical patterns of economic development (Mao et al. 2013).

Nathan Eagle, who holds joint professorships in epidemiology and computer science at Harvard and

Northeastern universities, has looked at how social network structure can be inferred from cell phone data,
and how the diversity of contacts in a social network impacts economic d▯evelopment (Eagle, Pentland, et

al. 2009b; Eagle et al. 2010). Among numerous other works, Eagle has also used cell phone data to make
comparisons between rural and urban communication and mobility behavior ▯(Eagle, de Montjoye, et al.
2009a). One of Eagle’s affiliations, the Engineering Social Systems Lab at Harvard, is a center of cell

phone-based studies, and he is the CEO of Jana, a company that offers free phone credit in exchange for
mobile subscriber engagement, including participation in research.

 Joshua Blumenstock at the University of Washington has done similar work to the Telefónica labs,
looking at how wealth and migration data can be extracted from cell phone use (Blumenstock et al. 2010;

Blumenstock 2012). Blumenstock and Eagle together have also examined ge▯nder and class differences
in cell phone use, information critical for making accurate inferences from phone data (Blumenstock

& Eagle 2012a). Blumenstock and Eagle, along with their colleague Dan Gillick at the University of
California-Berkeley, are among the few researchers to attempt to predict the sex of cell phone users using
                              4
a machine learning algorithm , although their model, using Rwandan CDR data, succeeds only marginally▯
(Blumenstock & Eagle 2012b). Their work, as well as that of Vanessa and Enrique Frías-Martinez, suggests
that the utility of such sex-prediction algorithms may vary considerably from context to context. “Ground-

truthing” validation surveys using conventional research methods are needed to gauge the context-specific
accuracy of models.

Various researchers have analyzed population movements following the 2010 earthquake and subsequent
cholera epidemic in Haiti, using data provided by Digicel, the country’s largest mobile operator. A team

lead by Linus Bengtsson of the Karolinksa Institute in Sweden, in partnership with Columbia University,
established the position of nearly two million SIM card holders before and after the earthquake, finding that

one-fifth of Port-au-Prince’s residents left the city by three weeks after the disaster (Bengtsson et al. 2011;
Lu et al. 2012). Other applications of CDR data sets to public health a▯re expanding. Rumi Chunara at

correlated well with government estimates, and was available considerably earlier (Chunara et al.▯ 2012).

Bengtsson is also the director and – with Xin Lu of Stockholm University and Erik Wetter of the
Stockholm School of Economics – co-founder of Flowminder.org, a non-profit organization that analyzes

CDRs and remote sensing data for public health. The organization, which counts Caro    ▯ line Buckee, Andy
Tatem of the University of Southampton, Joshua Blumenstock, Petter Holme of Umeå University, and

Amy Wesolowski as collaborators, focused initially on looking at the relationship between human mobility
patterns and public health outcomes following natural disasters and conflict▯s, but has increasingly been

involved in the analysis of similar issues in development contexts as we▯ll.
UN Global Pulse, an initiative of the UN Secretary-General launched in 2009, is an important player in big

data for development, piloting a number of innovative applications through partnerships with the private
sector and academia. Although Global Pulse has been active in publicizin▯g the utility of call detail records

in development research (UN Global Pulse 2013e), most of their own research partnerships deal with other
forms of big data, and are accordingly discussed at greater length in other sections. Similarly, various UN

2. Other Types of Data Exhaust

Many other types of data exhaust are waiting to be tapped          Actors highlighted in
for analysis. One notable example is the data generated by
                                                                   OtherTypes of Data Exhaust
M-PESA, the mobile money application developed through
a partnership of Safaricom, Kenya’s largest mobile network
                                                                   Private Sector
provider, and Vodafone (pilot funding for the project came
from the UK’s Department for International Development,             Safaricom

    Madagascar Ministry of Health and Institut Pasteur is operational in 13 health centers in the country,

    and has successfully provided early warnings of multiple disease outbreaks (Randrianasolo et al. 2010).
    In Botswana, Hewlett-Packard, Botswana’s Ministry of Health, the Clinton Foundation, the national

    mHealth NGO Positive Innovation for the New Generation (PING), Malaria No More UK, and the cell
    network provider Mascom have partnered to pilot SMS digital surveillance of malaria (PING 2012). Another

    cell phone-based malaria surveillance project set up by the World Health Organization, the Foundation
    for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND), Columbia University’s Earth Institute, and the Ministry of

    Health in Uganda yielded impressive results (Asiimwe et al. 2011). Dozens of similar mHealth projects
    exist (Royal Tropical Institute 2013). Many of these applications are facilitated by open-source and low-cost

    SMS frameworks like FrontlineSMS and RapidSMS, the latter developed initially by the UNICEF Innovation
    Lab (FrontlineSMS 2013; RapidSMS 2013). It is worth noting that mHealth is one of the few areas in which

    developing world government agencies, in this case Ministries of Health, are strongly engaging with
    the kinds of data profiled in this report – a critical prerequisite to big data research of any kind having a

    significant real world impact.

B. Online Activity

This section describes the landscape of online activity data, an        Private Sector
area dominated by information from Twitter feeds and Google

searches. Although developing world applications of these types          Twitter
of data are limited, the purposes to which they have been used
                                                                         Crimson Hexagon

pertinent to development efforts. The third subsection below looks

    The automated analysis of social media is currently one of
    the most important goals in computational linguistics. Beyond        UN Foundation

    simply counting the number of mentions of a particular topic,        Qatar Foundation: Qatar
    “sentiment analysis” and “opinion mining” techniques seek             Computing Research Institute
                                                                          (QCRI)
    to identify the ideas and emotions expressed in feeds. Such
    analysis sheds light on the underlying attitudes of social          Academia/Research Institutes

    media users that give rise to these ideas and emotions, how          Aron Culotta, Illinois Institute of
    these attitudes move through social networks, are opposed
                                                                          Technology
    or confirmed, and evolve in content (UNICEF et al. 2012; Liu         Michael J. Paul and Mark Dredze,
    2012; Pang & Lee 2008).
                                                                          Johns Hopkins University
    Early sentiment analysis work attempted to flag comments             Johan Bollen, Indiana University

    as merely positive, negative, or neutral. More recent efforts        Munmun De Choudhury, Georgia
    address advanced topics like emotion intensity and analysis           Tech University

    across languages (Paltoglou & Thelwall 2012; Tromp                   Data-Pop Alliance, Harvard
    2012). Instead of programmers specifying which words                  Humanitarian Initiative, MIT Media

    and phrases connote which sentiments, modern natural                  Lab, and Overseas Development

    Sentiment analysis of social media faces many challenges,
    including unconventional language formulations, the use              UN Millennium Campaign

    of slang, and missing information about context (Bifet &             UNICEF

Frank 2010; Power et al. 2010). Machine learning methods, however, are increasingly able to handle such
heterogeneity (Barbosa & Feng 2010; Collier et al. 2011)

At this point, Twitter is the main source of sentiment and opinion data, due to its public accessibility,

the amount of information available, user diversity, and the range of topics discussed (Pak & Paroubek
2010). UN Global Pulse is carrying out several Twitter-centered projects. One, in conjunction with the
UN Foundation, looks at whether the Every Woman Every Child program has been effective in raising

awareness of child and women’s health issues, as measured by number of tweets (UN Global Pulse 2013a).
A Twitter sentiment analysis performed by Crimson Hexagon and UN Global Pulse in Indonesia finds

that conversation about economic concerns revolves around four subjects, “housing, gas/fuel, personal
finance, and food” (Lopez & St. Amand 2013). The monitoring syste▯m examines weekly and monthly
patterns in trending topics, and serves as a surveillance system for tracking prices o▯f key staple foods

like rice (UN Global Pulse 2013f). The project finds that Twitter feeds pick up short-term concerns better
than longer-term goals (Crimson Hexagon & UN Global Pulse 2011). UN Global Pulse also▯ has an ongoing

partnership with the UN Millennium Campaign and DataSift to scan Twitter for the most commonly
discussed development-related topics worldwide. The results suggest that, in contrast to surveys that
ask about long-term priorities, analysis of Twitter feeds enables a unique understanding of “daily hopes

and grievances”, although the data is certainly biased towards the young and better-off (Nielsen 2013).
Among UN bodies, UNICEF recently undertook a study of social media content in Eastern Europe to look
at attitudes towards vaccination (Majewski & Beger 2013). A project of the Qatar Foundation-funded

Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI) and the Data-Pop Alliance, a joint initiative of the Harvard
Humanitarian Initiative, the MIT Media Lab, and the Overseas Development▯ Institute, is looking at whether

Twitter sentiments can indicate trends of poverty and unemployment (Meier 2013). More broadly, the
Data-Pop Alliance is engaged in a diverse body of work around big data and development, including
compiling a comprehensive e-library of past and ongoing research, working with national statistical offices

to incorporate big data, and conducting primary research on key methodological issues around accurate
and rigorous analysis of big data. They are also a key actor in kick-starting the dialogue around the political

economy of big data, including confronting the issue of big data’s impact on the democratization of
information for development.

Epidemic surveillance through Twitter feeds has been a major focus of academic research (Krieck &
Dreesman 2011; Lopes et al. 2009). Influenza is by far the most studied▯ illness. To provide just one

example, Aron Culotta of the Illinois Institute ofTechnology, using only a small set of matching
keywords, finds a 95% correlation between a set of 570 million tweets in 2009-10 and official health
statistics (Culotta 2010). The list of researchers and universities involved with influenza surveillance through

Twitter is too long to include here, but some of the the key studies include those done by Aramaki et al. ▯
(2011), Lampos & Cristianini (2010), and Achrekar et al. (2011). Michael J. Paul and Mark Dredze at

Johns Hopkins University have done similar work looking at illnesses other than influenza, and ▯identify
behavioral risk factors, symptoms, and treatments used (Paul & Dredze 2011a; Paul & Dredze 2011b).
Twitter feed content can also be combined with user locations and the int▯eraction of that user with friends

on social media to predict future health states — that is, to trace the spread of an illness through social
networks (Sadilek et al. 2012). Illness spreading can also be tracked geographically if Twitter users elect to

geo-tag their tweets.

Twitter applications are diversifying. Munmun De Choudhury (now at Georgia Tech University) and
her collaborators at Microsoft Research have looked at links between clinically diagnosed depression
and social media expression, and used these correlations to identify signals of depression among Twitter

users who have not been clinically diagnosed (De Choudhury et al. 2013a). De Choudhury’s team has






www.data2x.org                                             7
also used Twitter data to predict emotional states among postpartum mothers (De Choudhury et al.
2013b). Johan Bollen at Indiana University and his collaborators looked at all tweets in a five-month

period at the beginning of the global recession in 2008. They use a psychological tool called the Profile
of Mood States to test the extent to which economic hardship led to emotions like tension, depression,
anger, fatigue, and confusion, as picked up by Twitter feeds (Bollen et al. 2009). Fluctuations measured

by similar Twitter-based mood tracking tools can be predictive of economic trends at the population level,
for example changes in stock market averages (Bollen et al. 2010). Twitter feeds have also been analyzed

as an inexpensive means of gauging political views (Stieglitz & Dang-Xu▯an 2012; Tumasjan et al. 2010).
Correlations of tweets with polls and other more commonly used means of gauging political sentiment tend
to vary across contexts, but improvements in textual analysis and identification of bias are likely to improve

the performance of current methods (O’Connor et al. 2010). Twitter itself recently launched a data grant
program to allow selected researchers access to data sets (Krikorian 2014).


2. Google

Google search data has been useful in epidemic surveillance.
Google Flu Trends, building on the pioneering work of                Actors highlighted in Google

Gunther Eysenbach (2006) of the University of Toronto and            Private Sector
others, and operated by Google itself, is currently the most
widely studied application (Google 2014a). The service works
                                                                      Google
by correlating tens of millions of search queries with official
data on influenza-like illness from the Centers for Disease          Academia

Control (CDC) (Watts 2009). The search terms that prove to            Gunther Eysenbach, University of
be the strongest determinants of flu are combined in a linear          Toronto
model to predict incidence in advance (Ginsberg et al. 2008).

Flu Trends has been shown to pick up patterns 7 to 10 days
before CDC data (Carneiro & Mylonakis 2009), and correlations hold in both the US and Europe (Valdivia

et al. 2010). Updated models also show correlation with non-seasonal outbreaks like the H1N1 epidemic
in 2009 (Cook et al. 2011). Flu Trends also correlates with “harder” forms of health system data such as
positive influenza tests and emergency room intakes of people with flulike symptoms (Dugas et al. 2012

;Ortiz et al. 2011). Because Google search data is publicly available, external researchers have been able
to develop ever stronger algorithms for interpreting illness trend data, controlling for such factors as the

degree of Internet activity and the size of a population (Pevaiz et al. 2013).
Google searches have also been used to track seasonal illnesses other than influe▯nza. Google searches

for dengue, for example, correlate extremely well with official statistics on infection across many countries
(Althouse et al. 2011). Searches pertaining to Lyme disease also corroborated spatial and temporal

patterns in the US (Seifter et al. 2010). Google searches also correlate with certain chronic noninfectious
diseases that vary seasonally, including hypertension, heart attacks, diabetes, and kidney stones (Breyer
& Eisenberg 2013). John Ayers and his collaborators have found that Google searches can also function

well for mental health surveillance, with clear distinct seasonal patter▯ns appearing in the United States and
Australia for a wide variety of mental health problems (Ayers et al. 2013).

Research on non-health topics (that are relevant to development) using Google search queries is still rare,

although there has been some investigation of how searches predict market activity and socioeconomic
welfare (Wu 2009; Preis et al. 2012). The creation of Google Trends, a site provided by Google to track
frequency of search terms disaggregated by country and time period, should facilitate such work in the

future (Google 2014b).

        3. Other Online Activity

        There are many other types of online activity analysis. Twitter, of
                                                                           Actors highlighted in
        course, is not the only source of online sentiment information.
        A partnership between UN Global Pulse and the statistical          Other Online Activity
        software company SAS examined conversations in blogs and

        forums about jobs and unemployment in Ireland and the US.          Private Sector
        By classifying the moods revealed in these conversations, the       SAS

        project was able to identify leading, in-process, and trailing      Facebook
        indicators of unemployment (UN Global Pulse 2013g; SAS &
                                                                            Recorded Future
        UN Global Pulse 2011). UN Global Pulse is also partnering with
        the International Labor Organization and Indonesia’s Ministry       PriceStats

        of National Development Planning to analyze online articles,       NGOs
        blogs, and social media to understand women’s workplace             DataKind

        conditions and public views on women’s employment in
        Indonesia (UN Global Pulse 2014). Although sentiment analysis      Academia/Research
        of Facebook posts is complicated by non-public posting and         Institutes

        the length of messages, some initial attempts are underway,         John Brownstein and Clark
        including a measure of Facebook-based “gross national                Freifeld, Boston’s Children Hospital

        happiness” in the United States (Kramer 2010; Shrivastava &         Massachusetts Institute of
        Pant 2012).                                                          Technology (MIT)

        Health surveillance through website content analysis is also       Multilateral Institutions

        expanding. John Brownstein and Clark Freifeld of Boston             UN Global Pulse
        Children’s Hospital created HealthMap in 2006, an application
        to mine reports of epidemic outbreaks from a variety of web         UNDP

        sources, including news sites, RSS feeds, and official alerts
        from health agencies (Brownstein et al. 2009; Brownstein &

        Freifeld 2007; Brownstein et al. 2008; Freifeld et al. 2008). Various other “digital epidemiology” applications
        using online activity data are operational or in development (Salathé et al. 2012). More generally, advances

        in computing power make mining of massive amounts of data — even orig▯inally non-digital data, for
        example from news headlines archives — possible, and this holds great potential for tracking social trends

        (Leetaru 2011). The UNDP worked with Recorded Future to scan tens of thousands of online media
        sources to assess political risk in Georgia prior to the country’s 2008 elections (Radojevic 2012).

        Price scraping is another form of online activity monitoring. A partnership of UN Global Pulse, PriceStats,
        and the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology’s Billion Prices Project searches websites for product and

        price information, noting the source and time of the scraped data. In the pilot project, bread prices were
        collected between 2007 and 2011 in supermarkets in six South American countries. The data was used to

        create an “e-Bread index” to estimate inflation in these countries (Rigobon 2011;▯ UN Global Pulse 2013c).
        Similarly, the data scientist volunteer NGO DataKind has developed tools to scrape price websites to

        estimate inflation in Kenya (DataKind 2013).

    C. Sensing Technologies
    Although the phrase “big data” is relatively new, the existence of large, complexly structured data sets is not.

    Of particular note is the enormous amount of information collected by satellites and other remote sensing
    devices over the past several decades. With these launch of new satellit▯es by middle-income countries over the

    last few years, the quantity of data has recently expanded even more. In addition, increases in the computing
    power available to analyze these massive data sets, and new methodologie▯s developed to take advantage of

this computer power, open up exciting possibilities for research. The following sections briefly review the use
of remote sensing technologies in development, as well as take a brief look ▯at the new generation of personal

“non-remote” passive sensing technologies.

    1. Remote Sensing

    The most important application of remote sensing to                 Actors highlighted in
    development comes in the mapping of environmental
    phenomena and human infrastructure, including vegetation,           Remote Sensing

    water bodies, transport networks, and land use patterns.
    Sensing research on spatiotemporal variation in public health       Government Departments

    conditions, for example malaria vector abundance, dates              US National Aeronautics and
    back more than two decades (see (Beck et al. 1994; Beck               Space Administration (NASA)

    et al. 1997), among many others). However, it is only in the         US National Oceanic and
    last decade or so that this research has been utilized in the         Atmospheric Administration
    policy process through the creation of epidemic early warning         (NOAA),

    systems and other initiatives (Ceccato et al. 2005; Thomson &        France’s National Center of Space
    Connor 2001); as noted above, increased computing power               Studies (CNES)

    is partially responsible for the more rapid turnaround between
    data collection and release of analytical results.

    Remote sensing systems can predict the degree of both inter-year and intra-year risk of illness, and
    thereby help mobilize preventative and curative resources well in advance of actual morbidity and mortality.

    Although malaria has been by far the most studied disease through remote sensing, the epidemiological
    landscapes of a wide variety of other illnesses have also been analyzed.▯ An incomplete list includes lyme

    disease, cholera, meningitis, dengue, Rift Valley fever, schistosomiasis, West Nile fever, and even obesity
    (Kelly et al. 2011; Beck et al. 2000; Molesworth et al. 2003).

    Another important application is food security forecasting based on satellite sensing of vegetation density.
    The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the most commonly used measure, is calculated

    relies on the observation that growing plants absorb radiation in the visible range of the electromagnetic
    spectrum and reflect light in the near-infrared range (Ceccato et al. 2005). Satellites that gather data
    across the spectrum are able to thus estimate vegetation density and predict crop yields well before the

    actual harvest. In combination with household-level information on factors like family size, available labor,
    input and output costs, and so on, NDVI can help evaluate the risk of im▯pending food insecurity (Quinn

    et al. 2010). NDVI can also be used be used to predict occurrence of seasonal diseases, which are often
    determined by changes vegetation density and thus vector habitat (Rahman et ▯al. 2006; Adimi et al. 2010;

    Machault et al. 2011).
    Many other applications of remote sensing data exist. Access to schools, health facilities, and wate▯r points

    is often determined in the developing world by distance, physical obstacles, and trans▯port networks,
    especially for rural communities. Remote sensing data can help predict seasonal fluctuations in time and

    transport costs of accessing these resources — as, for example, rainfall affects road quality or river levels
    — and evaluate these changes in light of intra-year variations in inc▯ome availability and expenditures. Other
    ideas are being developed; for example, recent work looks at remote sensing of lighting as an indicator of

    poverty levels (Noor et al. 2008; The World Bank & DataKind 2013).

    One key characteristic of remote sensors involves the tradeoff between spatial and temporal resolution
    (Hay et al. 2012). For example, accurate evaluation of disease risk requires the use of both high spatial

    resolution sensors for measurement of factors like land cover and land use and high temporal resolution






    www.data2x.org                                           10
sensors to pick up changes in temperature, rainfall, and crop density (Machault et al. 2011). Advances

in image analysis of high spatial resolution data are increasingly allowing researchers to identify micro-
level variations in, for example, vector habitat (Kelly et al. 2011), ▯which is critically important for assessing
disease risk and transmission dynamics in highly heterogeneous environments like urban areas (Tatem &

Hay 2004).

Government agencies are the most important sources of freely available remote sensing data. Until recently,
most health remote sensing research used data from the United States’ National Aeronautics and Space

Administration (NASA) Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) and Thematic Mapper (TM)▯ satellites,
the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric

Administration (NOAA), and the French National Center of Space Studies’ (CNES) Earth Observation
System (SPOT) (Beck et al. 2000). Many more earth observation satellites have been launched in the past

few years by governments around the world (UCS 2013).

2. Personal Sensing
A new generation of personal sensors, embedded in phones,
                                                                  Actors highlighted in
motor vehicles, and other technologies, is being used to
passively measure and interpret behavioral signals — a            Personal Sensing

field known as “reality mining” (Eagle & Sandy Pentland
2005). Alex“Sandy”Pentland’s Human Dynamics                       Private Sector

Lab at the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology is                 BBN Technologies, Raytheon
among the leaders in this field. Voice analysis software
                                                                  Academia/Research Institutes
and accelerometers built into cell phones may be able to
diagnose signs of depression and stress. GPS-enabled               Alex “Sandy” Pentland and Human
devices can infer social network structure by recording             Dynamics Lab, MIT

user movement patterns, and can also be used to locate             Metrosense, Dartmouth University
key public services more efficiently based on the study            Center for Embedded Network

of the aggregated travel routes of tens of thousands of             Sensing, UCLA
people (Pentland et al. 2013; Pentland et al. 2009). Bicycle-      Cartel project, MIT

mounted sensors, such as those developed by Dartmouth              Citysense, Harvard University
University’s Metrosense project for its Bikenet application,
                                                                  Government Departments
can gather pollution data in cities and develop a spatially
and temporally rich portrait of threats to human health. The       City of Cambridge, Massachusetts

University of California-Los Angeles’ (UCLA) Center for
Embedded Network Sensing, Intel’s Urban Atmospheres
initiative, MIT’s Cartel project, and the CitySense

partnership of Harvard University, the City of Cambridge, and BBN Technologies are also important
endeavors in the building of personal sensing networks (Campbell et al.▯ 2008).

To this point, few personal sensing technologies have been applied for de▯velopment, but the potential is

great, particularly in the field of “participatory sensing”, wherein individuals and communities are able to
choose priorities and carry out projects. As Burke et al. (2006) write,



       With the right tools, professionals and community groups alike could employ
       participatory sensing campaigns to gather data about short-term concerns…without
       waiting for a formal project or grant funding— yielding bottom-up, grassroots sensing.
       Citizens have intimate knowledge of patterns and anomalies in their communities and

       enabling them to respond is both empowering and valuable to long-term research…






www.data2x.org                                          11
    The point about “patterns and anomalies” cannot be overemphasized. The overall objective of sensing

    is to detect such variation, and local knowledge can greatly help researchers design more relevant
    technologies from the start. This is where the boundary between sensing and crowdsourcing (discussed in
    the next section) blurs: the creation of a body of local knowledge that is assisted by imports of ideas and

    technologies, but driven primarily by the wishes and needs of those who ▯stand to benefit most from that
    knowledge.


D. Crowdsourcing
This section reviews crowdsourcing applications used in both humanitarian and development contexts. NG▯Os
have generally taken the lead in implementing crowdsourcing applications in humanitarian emergencies, and

multilateral institutions have done the same in development.

    1. Humanitarian Emergencies

    The NGO Ushahidi first gained notice in 2008 for its efforts in   Actors highlighted in
    crisis mapping violence in the aftermath of Kenya’s elections     Humanitarian Emergencies

    (Meier 2008). Ushahidi was also praised for its work in helping
    the United States military and other emergency responders
                                                                      NGOs
    find individuals in need, mainly using Twitter reports, following
    the 2010 Haitian earthquake (Munro 2010). In the early days        Ushahidi

    following the disaster, Ushahidi was in fact the only source       Mission 4636
    of aggregate geospatial information, processing at least
    40,000 reports and mapping nearly 4000 individual events           OpenStreetMap
                                                                       International Network of Crisis
    (Morrow et al. 2011). Integration with translation services
    like Mission 4636 and open source mapping platforms like            Mappers: Patrick Meier, Jen
                                                                        Ziemke
    OpenStreetMap helped improve the usability of the data
    stream.                                                            Standby Task Force
                                                                       Sahana
    The Ushahidi experience in Haiti led to a rapid expansion in
                                                                       Humanity Road
    crisis mapping initiatives. The International Network of Crisis
    Mappers, co-founded by Patrick Meier and Jen Ziemke in            Private Sector
    2009, has grown to include over 6000 members worldwide.
                                                                       Twitter
    The network, supported by a wide range of multilateral
    organizations and government agencies, universities, and

    private companies, organizes an annual conference that is an important forum for the exchange of ideas
    around humanitarian technology. The Standby Task Force, created at the 2010 conference, mobilizes

    volunteers to assist on-the-ground response teams in mapping needs, although its data sources are
    broader than crowdsourced reports alone. Sahana and Humanity Road are just two other prominent

    organizations of the many who use crowdsourcing data as part of their approach to assist in increasing
    information flow in humanitarian emergencies. Crisis mapping is becoming ev▯er more sophisticated. The

    current Syria Tracker Crisis Map efforts, built on Ushahidi’s Crowdmap platform, combines crowdsourced
    reports from Twitter, Facebook, and other sources with data mining programs that scour the Web for news
    of important events, especially killings and human rights violations (Meier 201▯2).


    2. Development
    UN Global Pulse is conducting several crowdsourcing projects in non-humanitarian contexts. One massive

    effort is the partnership between UN Global Pulse and Jana, a company that provides free airtime in
    exchange for user input, to paint a global portrait of human welfare through SMS surveys. The initial survey

    received over 90,000 responses from more than thirty countries (UN Global Pulse 2013d). Global Pulse






    www.data2x.org                                          12
is also partnering with Question Box, a service allowing

users to ask questions to an Internet search team about any       Actors highlighted in
subject, to track temporal trends in people’s concerns (UN        Development

Global Pulse 2013h). UN Global Pulse’s Uganda lab — one
of three offices piloting techniques on the country level — is    Multilateral Institutions

also experimenting with using crowdsourcing within an early        UN Global Pulse
warning system for economic and environmental shocks. The
                                                                   UNICEF Uganda
idea would be to detect anomalies in data exhaust, such as
decreased mobile phone airtime purchases, remittances, or          World Food Program (WFP)

banking activity, and then solicit crowdsourced information       Private Sector
from ground-level sources. If such information indicates an
                                                                   Jana
incipient crisis, more formal surveys would be launched            Question Box
(Kirkpatrick 2010).
                                                                   Mobile Accord
UNICEF’s Uganda office is implementing U-Report, a mobile

phone application that sends questions on development             Donor Agencies and
topics to over 250,000 members (UNICEF Uganda 2014).              Foundations

These “reporters” respond, at no cost, by selecting an             USAID
option from a pre-formulated menu or sending more detailed
                                                                   UK DFID
replies. The results can be easily disaggregated by sex            Canadian International
and age. Although there is a clear bias towards youth in its
                                                                    Development Agency (CIDA)
membership, the application has been useful in capturing           Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs
general trends of public sentiment and helping to start
                                                                   African Development Bank (AfDB)
informational campaigns about key topics. In one instance, an
outbreak of nodding disease was identified through U-Report       NGOs

and treatment information sent to the affected area. Automated     mWater
text classification tools have allowed more detailed analysis
                                                                   Question Box
of the information arriving from U-Report (Melville et al. 2013).
UNICEF Uganda is also experimenting with a range of other

digital reporting applications, including a school monitoring, birth registration, disease surveillance, and
information on access to health services (Cummins & Huddleston 2013).

Crowdsourcing is also gaining favor among donors. The United States Agency for International

Development (USAID) provided funding to the nonprofit organization mWater to develop a mobile phone
application in Tanzania that helps citizens perform water quality tests and upload this information to a

database that maps water sources

(mWater 2013). The World Food Program (WFP), supported by the Humanitarian Innovation Fund — a
joint venture financed by the UK’s DFID, the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA),

and the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs — has also launched the mVAM pilot project to collect
food security information through SMS surveys in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia

(Humanitarian Innovation Fund 2013; WFP 2013). The African Development Bank (AfDB), in partnership
with the mobile platform services company Mobile Accord, is also using SMS surveys to gauge the impact

of AfDB-supported projects (AfDB 2012).

E. Non-Research Activities

This section reviews non-research activities — especially the
setting of funding priorities, the publicizing of big data’s potentialActors highlighted in
                                                                      Non-Research Activities
for development, and the creation of forums to exchange ideas
and data sets — that have an important impact on the big data

research agenda.                                                      Multilateral Institutions
                                                                       UN Global Pulse
As discussed in previous sections, UN Global Pulse plays a key
role in disseminating information about the applications of big        UNDP

data to development (UN Global Pulse 2013b). In addition to its        World Bank
research partnerships with various private sector companies and
UN agencies, Global Pulse has also expanded awareness of big          Donor Agencies and
                                                                      Foundations
data’s potential at a number of conferences.
                                                                       Gates Foundation
The Gates Foundation is increasingly engaging with big data
for development. The last round of the foundation’s “Grand             Ford Foundation

Challenges Initiative” awarded six $100,000 grants under the topic     Skoll Foundation
of “increasing the interoperability of social good data”. The winning  Moore Foundation

projects included ideas to improve information management              Sloan Foundation
following natural disasters, incorporating community data on
                                                                       Qatar Foundation: QCRI
education, developing tools to build cross-data set compatibility,
and mapping key community assets like water points and health         NGOs

clinics through a micro-blogging application (Information Week         DataKind
2013). The Gates Foundation has also invested heavily in big

data systems to collect geographical, medical supply, and health
service tracking information in its polio eradication program (Greenberg 2014).

Other foundations have played important roles. The Ford Foundation and the Skoll Foundation sponsor two
major events around big data, the Wired for Change Conference and the Skoll World Forum (Ford Foundation

2012; Skoll Foundation 2013). The Moore Foundation and the Sloan Foundation recently launched a 5-year,
$38 million initiative to support big data research at New York University, the University of California-Berkeley,

and the University of Washington. The Qatar Computing Research Institute consults on various projects
involving Twitter and cell phone data, led by its director, Patrick Meier, formerly the head of crisis mapping at

Ushahidi.

Several “DataDives”, where organizations and individuals explore data sets and exchange ideas on how to
use big data for development, have been held in the last few years. Buil▯ding on the efforts of DataKind — the

volunteer data scientist NGO that developed the original “DataDive”▯ concept — the UNDP and the World Bank
held a DataDive in February 2013 in Vienna. With UN Global Pulse and QCRI, the Bank organized a si▯milar “Big

Data Exploration” in Washington DC in March 2013. Both events focused on poverty measurement and systems
to monitor project-level corruption (Center for Public Administration Research & Open Knowledge Foundation
2013; World Bank & DataKind 2013).

Overall, following a long period of initial skepticism about the use of ▯big data in development, donors have

greatly increased their engagement with big data in the past two years. There is currently a window of
opportunity for new ideas: funding is increasing and the state of research is democratic and innovative, driven

often by unconventional partnerships across academic disciplines and among actors from the private, public,
and non-profit sectors.

 Conclusion
 This report has reviewed the major themes in big data research for development and highlighted the role of key

 actors. Private companies, especially mobile phone network operators, Go▯ogle, and Twitter, control much of the
 data exhaust and online activity data being currently used. The majority of academics working with big data for

 development focus on behavioral inference from cell phone records, epidemiological surveillance from Google
 searches, and sentiment analysis from Twitter feeds, although many other smaller strands of big data research are
 also being pursued. Multilateral institutions, especially UN Global Puls▯e, play a key role in publicizing the potential of

 big data in development. Foundations fund big data research through a variety of financing streams, and have been
 important in creating forums where big data researchers can exchange ideas and data sets. To this point, donors

 and developing world governments have been focused mostly on smaller crowdsourcing initiatives, as well as
 opening up data access and creating more user-friendly data management systems, although their scope of interest
 is expanding. NGOs have thus far been largely limited to data sharing, e▯xcept in the category of humanitarian

 crowdsourcing, where tech-savvy organizations have taken the lead.

 In closing, one common misperception about the future of big data is worth addressing: the notion that big data
 can wholly replace more traditional data systems. On the contrary, for the foreseeable future the utility of big data
 will depend on the creative combining of big data and traditional data sets to analyze develo▯pment phenomena.

 For example, mobile phone and social media data sets are not necessarily representative of the behavior of the
 entire population; in particular, sub-groups with limited access to technology may be under-represented. In other

 words, big data sets are not by virtue of their size exempt from the conventional requirements of good statistical
 methodology. Ground-truthing research using conventional survey methods is often needed to validate the
 representativeness of big data, or to identify the nature and magnitude of biases within big data sets. Once these

 biases are known, the potential of big data – namely, information that is highly spatially disaggregated and is
 generated frequently, occasionally in real-time – can be exploited in appropriate ways.
