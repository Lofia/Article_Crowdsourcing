    Abstract

    Structured gene annotations are a foundation upon which many bioinformatics and statistical analyses are built. However
    the structured annotations available in public databases are a sparse representation of biological knowledge as a whole. The
    rate of biomedical data generation is such that centralized biocuration efforts struggle to keep up. New models for gene

    annotation need to be explored that expand the pace at which we are able to structure biomedical knowledge. Recently,
    online games have emerged as an effective way to recruit, engage and organize large numbers of volunteers to help
    address difficult biological challenges. For example, games have been successfully developed for protein folding (Foldit),
    multiple sequence alignment (Phylo) and RNA structure design (EteRNA). Here we present Dizeez, a simple online game

    built with the purpose of structuring knowledge of gene-disease associations. Preliminary results from game play online and
    at scientific conferences suggest that Dizeez is producing valid gene-disease annotations not yet present in any public
    database. These early results provide a basic proof of principle that online games can be successfully applied to the
    challenge of gene annotation. Dizeez is available at http://genegames.org.

provide preliminary results from game play online and at scientific
conferences. These data suggest that even after limited game play,

novel gene-disease annotations can be mined from game playing
logs.


Methods

  Dizeez is a multiple choice quiz where the player is presented
with a disease drawn from the Human Disease Ontology [15] (the

‘‘Clue’’) and a multiple-choice selector with five genes, only one of
which has prior evidence linking it to the Clue disease (Figure 1).
We used a set of 3,439 candidate gene-disease links mined from

the Gene Wiki [16] as the input data set for the Dizeez game. The
game randomly selects one of these links, and hides the disease
among four randomly chosen diseases (the four random diseases

were sampled at the frequency with which they appeared in the
input Gene Wiki dataset). If the player correctly guesses the known
disease from the list of five possible diseases, they receive points.

Regardless, all player answers are logged by the system as gene-
disease ‘‘assertions’’. Players are challenged to accumulate as many
points as possible in a one-minute round.

Figure 4. Concordance between Dizeez-mined associations and Disease and Gene Annotations database. The ‘concordance ratio’ on
the vertical axis is the ratio between the associations supported by DGA and the total number of associations for a given number of votes. ‘7+’
indicates the sum of associations collected with a number of votes between 7 and 11.

   The early results from Dizeez show two key things: 1) a very

   In future work, we intend to refine the aggregation system by

   One fundamental weakness of Dizeez is that players are
‘‘punished’’ when they add potentially novel associations. That             Author Contributions
