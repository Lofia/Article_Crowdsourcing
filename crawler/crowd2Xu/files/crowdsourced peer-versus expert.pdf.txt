o            Abstract
r               Background—Tailored, web-assisted interventions can reach many smokers. Content from other
M               smokers (peers) through crowdsourcing could enhance relevance.
n
s               Purpose—To evaluate whether peers can generate tailored messages encouraging other smokers
r               to use a web-assisted tobacco intervention (Decide2Quit.org).
p
t               Methods—Phase 1: In 2009, smokers wrote messages in response to scenarios for peer advice.
                These smoker-to-smoker (S2S) messages were coded to identify themes. Phase 2: resulting S2S
                messages, and comparison expert messages, were then emailed to newly registered smokers. In
                2012, subsequent Decide2Quit.org visits following S2S or expert-written e-mails were compared.
                Results—Phase 1: a total of 39 smokers produced 2886 messages (message themes: attitudes and
                expectations, improvements in quality of life, seeking help, and behavioral strategies). For not-
N
H               ready-to-quit scenarios, S2S messages focused more on expectations around a quit attempt and
P               how quitting would change an individual’s quality of life. In contrast, for ready-to-quit scenarios,
A               S2S messages focused on behavioral strategies for quitting. Phase 2: In multivariable analysis,
A               S2S messages were more likely to generate a return visit (OR=2.03, 95% CI=1.74, 2.35),

N                         Although theoretically sound,1these expert-written tailoring systems may not account
H                         for sociocultural concepts that have intrinsic importance to the targeted population, limiting
P                         their relevance to the audienceExpert-written messages may also omit some topics
A                         relevant to smokers and may be written in a form or use wording that poorly reflects the
A                         real-world experiences of the smokers engaged in the intervention. Messages “in a smoker’s
t                         own words” may be more persuasive to other smokers because they reflect shared
o
M                         experiences, allowing smokers to more easily identify with message content.
a
n                         Peer-to-peer communication is increasingly recognized as an important form of persuasive
s                         communication. Recent interventions have used patient storytelling or narrative
r                         communication effectively to motivate behavior changPeer-to-peer communication
p                         does map to important constructs within Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) (i.e., role
t                         modeling).31SCT argues that an individual’s social and physical environments;
                          observational learning (i.e., role modeling); and behavioral capabilities (i.e., skills) can
                          influence behavioral changePeer-to-peer communication can exemplify all of these
                          factors by illustrating the difficulties, skills, and strategies needed for smoking cessation.

                          Peer-to-peer communication also enhances homophily, a feeling of similarity between the
                          message writer and the message reader.

             Smoker-to-Smoker Message Solicitation (Phase 1)
                         For S2S Phase 1 (message solicitation), smokers were recruited through advertisements on
                         Google AdWords.37After clicking on the advertisement, eligible smokers (those aged >19
                         years) were directed to an online informed consent before agreeing to participate.
                         Participation included a short survey collecting demographics and smoking behavior.
                         Successful quitters (former smokers) were defined as anyone who has smoked cigarettes or
N
H                        cigars in their lifetime but has not had at least one puff in the past 7 days. Current smokers
-                        with a recent quit attempt were defined as smoking at least one puff of a cigarette or cigar in
A                        the past 7 days but reporting having at least one serious quit attempt lasting 24 hours in the
A                        past 6 months. Current smokers were included because even though the participant had not
u                        successfully quit smoking long term, the experiences gained from any quit attempt can still
h                        be valuable to other smokers. Message writers’ e-mail and telephone numbers were
r                        collected for follow-up contact to confirm an address for reimbursement.
M
n                        The scenarios varied on readiness to quit smoking (ready to quit or not ready to quit); age;
u                        and gender (Appendix A, available online at www.ajpmonline.org). Each individual
c                        responded to four scenarios: two matched to the peer message writer’s age and gender and
p                        two randomly generated. The ready-to-quit scenarios addressed advice and experiences that
t                        might be useful to other smokers before, on, and after the quit date. The not-ready-to-quit

             Smoker -to-Smoker Message Coding of Peer Messages (Phase 1)

                         Two certified tobacco treatment specialists reviewed the messages. Example messages
I                        included: “It helped a lot to set up milestones like I won’t smoke while I do this one thing”
-                        or “Keep in mind that cravings are temporary and will pass.” To develop a coding schema, a
P                        subset of messages was reviewed by both coders together. Additional messages were
A                        reviewed until the coders began to experience theme saturation. All messages were then
u                        reviewed once independently by both coders, and they then met to resolve any
h                        discrepancies. Multiple codes could be used for each message.
r
M                        Smoker-to-smoker messages were selected for Phase 2 using specific criteria: whether the
a                        message could be directly quoted, the behavioral content of the message, and whether the
u                        message followed the key concepts in SCT (Appendix B, available online at
c
p                        www.ajpmonline.org). Directly quotable means the message was written in sentence form
t                        and contained a clear, detailed message targeted to the scenario. For example, “Focus on
                         how great it is that you can do the same things without smoking [and] that you don’t need to
                         smoke to enjoy your friends” meets all three inclusion criteria. However, “think about why
                         you want to quit” is quotable but does not contain strong behavioral content, or personal
                         experiences on how to overcome this challenge. A final iterative group review with
                         behaviorists, physicians, and nurses ensured that the messages were appropriate and relevant
                         to the intervention goals.

A                        mail messages encouraging cessation were developed through an iterative expert group
t                        review process. Expert message e-mail content was guided by currentandidelines
o                        SCT. 31The current guideline provided evidence-based content on successful cessation
M                        strategies. SCT, which incorporates vicarious learning and verbal persuasion, guided the
a                        expert messages. Messages reflected theoretic determinants of quitting, such as positive
n                        outcome expectations and small goals to enhance self-efficacy.

r
t            Expert and Smoker-to-Smoker Message Evaluation (Phase 2)
                         When registering at Decide2Quit.org, smokers consented and completed an assessment of
                         smoking behaviors and readiness to quit. Smokers then received a series of automated e-
                         mail messages—both the S2S messages and the expert-written ones—that were tailored to
                         the readiness-to -quit data that the smoker entered when registering. The study was
                         conducted between June 2010 and June 2011. Each message was sent only one time per
                         smoker.
N
H                        Readiness to quit was assessThe readiness question consisted of five options: I am not
-
A                        thinking of quitting (precontemplation); I am thinking of quitting (contemplation); I have set
A                        a quit date (preparation); I quit today (action); and I have already quit (maintenance). In the
u                        first week of registration, four messages were sent to the user (two of each). Every week
h                        thereafter, one expert and one smoker-to-smoker message was sent. Messages were sent
r                        alternately. In this design, each smoker serves as their own control, as on some days they

n                        messages. The e-mail message subject indicated whether the message was expert-written or
u                        smoker-written. The subject line of the expert-written messages was “A message from
c                        Decide2Quit online smoking cessation system,” whereas the smoker-written message

             Data Analysis

N                        For Phase 1, to verify that peer message writers would change (tailor) their advice based on
H                        the scenarios, the range and frequency of the S2S message codes were assessed and
-                        compared across scenario type (ready-to-quit versus not-ready-to-quit scenarios). For Phase
A                        2, to evaluate whether S2S-written tailored messages resulted in greater subsequent website
A                        participation, number of visits occurring after S2S message e-mails was compared to visits
u                        following expert-written e-mails. Visits that did not occur in relation to a message were
h                        excluded. Each smoker received expert messages and peer messages. Thus, each participant
r                        serves as their own control.
M
n                        The analysis was conducted at the message level (within-in participant). As messages were
u                        clustered within patients and the unit of observation was at the patient level, a modeling
c                        approach appropriate to hierarchic data was used. The primary dependent variable was
p                        visiting the website on the day a message was sent. The independent variable was type of
t                        message sent (S2S message or expert-written); adjusting for the smoker’s demographic

                         variables (age, gender); baseline readiness to quit (not thinking of quitting, thinking of
                         quitting, have set a quit date, and quit); routine use of the Internet (e.g., e-mail, gaming); and
                         the difference between the message date and the patient’s registration date (time to
                         message).

I                        Common approaches to clustered data include generalized estimating equations and

M
n                        In addition to modeling the overall effect of the S2S messages, several hypothesis-
u                        generating sensitivity analyses were conducted. First, an interaction of the effect of S2S
c                        messages and time-from-registration by adding an interaction term to the main model was
p                        assessed. Models stratified by specific time periods (days: 0–14, 15–30, 30–90, 90–120, and
t                        >120) were then created. Similarly, to see if the S2S varied by content, an interaction

                         between S2S message effect and individual content codes was investigated.

             Results of Google Advertising and Participants
I                        The Google advertisements were available from March 10–June 4, 2009. During this time,
H                        411 Google users clicked through to the survey. From the 411 users who viewed the study
P                        consent, 39 participants who, in the past 6 months, had successfully quit smoking or were
A                        current smokers with a recent quit attempt, completed the message-solicitation scenarios

M            Peer-to-Peer Messages Solicited
a                        A total of 2886 messages (1404 messages in response to a not-ready-to-quit scenario, and
u                        1482 messages in response to a ready to quit scenario) were collected from the 39 message
c                        writers. Each message had a mean of 1.2 codes (SD=0.68); an average of 7.6 words
p                        (SD=7.2); and an average Flesh-Kincaid grade level of 4.5. Codes were grouped into four
t                        larger themes (Table 2): attitudes and expectations (e.g., secondhand smoke is harmful to
                         others, I want to quit for my children); improvements in quality of life (e.g., live longer,

                         senses improve); seeking help (e.g., talking to doctors, online research); and behavioral
                         strategies (e.g., avoidance, substitution, distraction).
N
H                        Messages written to someone ready to quit differed from those given to someone not ready
-                        to quit (Table 2). For those not ready to quit, the messages focused more on expectations
A                        around a quit attempt and how quitting would change an individual’s quality of life (37.9%
A                        and 36.5% of messages from those not ready to quit, respectively). In contrast, for those
u
h                        ready to quit, the messages focused predominantly on behavioral strategies to use when
r                        quitting (57.6% of messages from those not ready to quit). Of note, one of the largest
M                        variations occurred with the mention of negative expectations, (e.g., “You have to go into it
n                        knowing there will be challenges and triggers…that you will have to overcome the addiction
u                        by fighting the temptation,”) present in 18% of messages in response to those not ready to
c                        quit, but nearly absent when writing to those ready to quit.
p
t                        Many S2S messages were not directly quotable. Examples of messages that are not directly
                         quotable are “breathe better” or “live longer.” Although these messages were important to
                         quantify the frequency of themes mentioned by message writers, the wording was not of
                         sufficient strength and clarity to include in an intervention to motivate cessation. Based on
                         the review, 3.9% of the messages were chosen as directly quotable and eligible for inclusion
                         in the intervention (2.97% were advice to someone ready to quit and 0.93% were advice to
                         someone not ready to quit.) In all, 57 smoker-written messages were selected for Phase 2.

-            Website Visit Comparison
A
A                        A total of 655 smokers participated in the Decide2Quit.org study website. The length of
u                        time each smoker participated was different (M=179.80 days, SD=106.83, median=171).
h                        The mean number of expert messages sent per smoker was 26 (SD=15), while the mean
r                        number of S2S messages sent was 14 (SD=7). A total of 1044 return visits occurred. Of
M                        these visits, 405 (38.8%) occurred on days when no messages were sent, and 639 (61.2%)
n                        occurred on days when the smoker received automated, tailored e-mail messages. The mean
u                        proportion of days per smoker when messages (either a peer or an expert) were sent out was
c                        32 (SD=13).
p
t                        A total of 17,169 expert messages were sent, and 1.75% of messages were followed by

                         return visits. In contrast, 9028 S2S messages were sent, and 3.70% of S2S messages were
                         followed by return visits. This doubling of return visits was significant (p<0.05). In
                         multivariable analysis, S2S messages were more likely to generate a return visit (OR=2.03,
                         95% CI=1.74, 2.35), compared with the expert-written messages. The effect remained after
                         adjusting for time-from-registration and for age, gender, baseline smoking status, and
I                        routine use of the Internet (e.g., e-mail, gaming). There were significant interactions of the
H                        effect of the message with the time-from-registration (p<0 .001). It was found that the
P                        advantage of peer versus expert messages was accentuated over time in a dose-dependent
A                        time. As the time interval from registration increased (e.g., 0–30, 30–90) the peer message
u                        effect increased (Table 3). There were also significant interactions of the effect of the
h                        message with the message codes (p <0.001). Comparing codes in expert and S2S messages,
r                        expert messages that resulted in visits had more “biomedical” codes (avoidance, behavioral
M                        strategies, health), while peer messages had more “social” and “real-life” codes

p            Discussion
t
                         The study demonstrated that peers can generate tailored messages that map to important
                         constructs within behavioral theories. Moreover, the study demonstrated a strong association
                         between delivering these S2S messages and a key engagement endpoint in the study

                          (participation in the web-assisted tobacco intervention). Smokers varied the content they
                          wrote in the messages in response to the scenarios. The resulting content aligned with the
                          behavioral concepts of SCT. Not all S2S-generated messages created were directly usable.
I
-                         However, the volume of messages (2886 S2S messages) allowed selection of a subset of
P                         S2S messages on a variety of motivational themes. The S2S study is the first to
A                         “crowdsource” the writing of tailored motivational messages for a web-assisted tobacco
u                         intervention.
h
r                         As maintaining engagement in web-assisted tobacco interventions is challenging, yet critical
M                         to intervention fidelity and subsequent cessation, these results provide interesting insights
a                         for future directions. In particular, they highlight how persuasive messages may maintain
u                         engagement, especially if the content is deemed by smokers to be realistic and authentic to
c                         their experiences and struggles with quitting. Smoking-cessation outcomes for web-assisted
p                         tobacco interventions have been associated with the numbernumber of website
t                         sections viewedand amount of time spent on the webThese persuasive messages
                          may increase the likelihood of these outcomes.

                          As demonstrated, Decide2Quit.org engagement was limited on days without pushed e-mail

                          messages. The majority of return visits (61.3%) occurred on days messages were sent, even
                          though these were a minority of the total days. In the Phase 2 evaluation, the peer-written
N                         S2S messages resulted in an increased number of visits as compared with expert messages.
H                         In the initial time periods, the increase was marginal. However, after 90 days, there was a
P                         noticeable difference between the two in their ability to trigger return visits. Longitudinal
A                         engagement of users in a web-assisted intervention is a huge challenge. Developing
A                         additional peer messages may be one strategy that could be used. This ability of the S2S
t                         messages to improve longitudinal engagement may be due to the S2S messages being “in a
o                         smoker’s own words” and reflecting shared or real-world experiences of smokers and
M                         allowing other smokers to more easily identify with the message content.
a
n                         To test this further, D2Q return visits were assessed by the motivational content codes.
s                         Interestingly, the codes seemed to divide in what is favored in S2S and expert messages.
r
t                         Codes that were favored in S2S messages included expectations, money, quality of life,
                          attitudes and friends. All of these codes represent the more “social” and “real-life” aspects of
                          smoking cessation and represent the day-to-day issues associated with smoking cessation
                          and the social and interpersonal influences on quitting. Such codes align with the concepts
                          of SCT in which the physical and social environment influences individual behavior change.

                          These results indicate that peer-generated content reflects these important concepts and
N                         suggest that such content may increase engagement with smoking-cessation efforts more
H                         than other types of content. Comparatively, the motivational content codes favored more in
-                         experts included the more “biomedical” codes of strategies (e.g., avoidance) and health. It
A                         suggests that peer-written content reflecting more the social interactions and aspects of
A                         quitting could better enhance the impact of the web-assisted tobacco intervention on
u                         subsequent smoking cessation. Although additional research may be needed, this provides
h
r                         important insights into future ways to communicate about smoking cessation to smokers and
M                         the message content components that may be more successful.

u            Limitations
c                         This study has limitations including that peer-written messages were of mixed quality with
p                         some mapping better to key behavioral concepts than others. Future studies could benefit
t                         from recruiting peer writers from various sources, such as the local community or even

                          social networks on the Internet. This could allow for a larger sample size and more variation
                          in messages collected. By recruiting from various resources, another limitation of this study


                           Am J Prev Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 November 01.
           Coley et al.                                                                         Page 8

                         may be addressed. The study cohort was small and predominately white (82.1%) and this
                         likely has an influence on the peer-written messages in that they may not be generalizable to
                         all races and ethnicities. In addition, the actual messages were likely influenced by the
I
-                        framing of the scenarios. Inclusion of additional scenarios or reframing of the current
P                        scenarios could lead to soliciting a larger variety of directly quotable messages. Several
A                        messages that were not directly quotable because of their wording were excluded. Providing
u                        clearer instructions to message writers might have averted this issue.
h
r                        Another limitation was that fewer peer-written S2S messages were sent to smokers than
M                        expert messages, mainly because there had been fewer peer-written messages selected to
a                        send. As this resulted in more opportunities to participate after expert messages, this
u                        unbalance should bias the results towards the expert messages, and the observed effect of the
c                        peer-written messages may be underestimated. Additionally, the analyses assessing website
p                        participation by visits on days the messages were sent may not account for a delayed effect
t                        of later website visits. Thus, the remarkable effect of participation following S2S and expert
                         messages may actually be underestimated.


             Conclusion
                         Additional research is needed to refine methods for directly collecting intervention content
                         from the target audience and to evaluate the impact of peer-generated content versus expert-
N                        generated content on cessation outcomes.
