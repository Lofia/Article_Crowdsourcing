  After receiving the first batch of DNA samples on May 28, 2011, sequencing runs with the use of the Ion Torrent
  Personal Genome Machine (PGM) and Illumina (small-insert library) were initiated simultaneously. On May 31, the
  second batch of DNA was received and used for Illumina large-insert sequencing. An assembly of the Ion Torrent
  reads was released on June 2, which enabled subsequent analyses (multilocus sequence typing, phylogenetic analysis,
  and genome comparisons). Errors in the Ion Torrent data were corrected with the use of later Illumina data, and a

  high-quality draft genome sequence was created. GS denotes generation of sequencing technology. The symbols at
