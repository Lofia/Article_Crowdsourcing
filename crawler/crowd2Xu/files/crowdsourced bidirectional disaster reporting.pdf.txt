        Abstract—Natural disasters are a large threat for people
      especially in developing countries such as Laos. ICT-based dis-
      aster management systems aim at supporting disaster warning
      and response efforts. However, the ability to directly communi-
      cate in both directions between local and administrative level is
      often not supported, and a tight integration into administrative

      workﬂows is missing. In this paper, we present the smartphone-
      based disaster and reporting system Mobile4D. It allows for
      bi-directional communication while being fully involved in
      administrative processes. We present the system setup and
      discuss integration into administrative structures in Lao PDR.

        Natural disasters are a threat for people in any country
      in the world. But especially in developing countries. They
      can have severe consequences that affect people’s lives. It is

      widely recognized that natural disasters are a main reason       Fig. 1. Flood in Lao PDR after typhoon Ketsana in September 2009. It
