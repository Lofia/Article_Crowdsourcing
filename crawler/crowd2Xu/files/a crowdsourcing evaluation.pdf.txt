             A new kind of science
                          The NIH (National Institutes of Health) Molecular Libraries and Imaging (MLI) initiative
I                         was designed as a cross-institutional effort to stimulate the discovery of novel small
-                         molecule tools for chemical biology. Supported by all 27 NIH institutes for a limited (up to
P
A                         9 years) period, the MLI pilot phase (2004-2008) stimulated the development of ten national
u                         high-throughput screening (HTS) centers known as the Molecular Libraries Screening
h                         Centers Network (MLSCN). The MLI also encouraged scientists to submit in a peer-
r                         reviewed process via MLSCN, assays amenable to medium- and high- throughput, novel
M                         substances to be tested, novel experimental data curated for MLSCN, as well as novel
a                         experimental results – all these to become freely accessible via the PubChem system . Key
u                         to the open-access, free access system of the MLI is the intention to complement, rather than
c                         duplicate drug discovery efforts currently carried out in a pharmaceutical industrial setting.
p                         At the heart of this complementary process is the creation and screening of a compound
t                         library aimed at the identification of small molecule modulators of biological functions,
                          suitable for basic research yet not necessarily ready to serve as starting points (leads) for

                          drug discovery. It was envisioned that the MLSCN sh1uld ‘not [be] interested primarily in
                          drug discovery but in the elucidation of biochemical pathways’ , by discovering small
                          molecule ‘tools’ or ‘probes’ to enable and support research in chemical biology.

N                         Having recognized that chemical biology relies on small molecule tools to ‘probe”
H                         biochemical aspects for all gene-encoded proteins, the majority of which the pharmaceutical
P                         industry considers yet “undruggable” , the NIH aimed not only to provide a suitable
A                         framework for the development of such “chemical probes”, but also to encourage a cultural
A                         shift towards open, cross-disciplinary, communication within multiple scientific and
t                         technological disciplines to facilitate probe discovery. These chemical tools are aimed at
o                         filling the gap between target identification, often regarded as an early step in drug
M                         discovery whereby a certain macromolecule or process is “targeted” for therapeutic
a                         manipulation via (often) small molecules, and lead discovery – an ulterior step that is often
n
s                         preceeded by HTS, thus based on “hit” identification and optimization. Hence, the MLI
r                         framework set the stage for a new phase1in academic science by broadly enabling this
t                         intermediate step of “chemical probe” discovery . The MLI further strengthened the
                          “community resource” aspect of the initiative by mandating rapid dissemination of all MLI-
                          generated data, and ensured freedom to operate by eliminating trade secrets and intellectual
                          property claims.

             Pilot tools

N                         Essential to this pilot phase was the creation of a chemical library, the Molecular Libraries
H                         Small Molecule Repository, or MLSMR. This library, accessible by querying “MLSMR” in
-                         PubChem Substance, was subjected to MLSCN bioactivity screening between 2004 and
A                         2008, for a total of 691 assays that were uploaded to PubChem. These included 242 primary,
A                         402 confirmatory and 8 summary assays, which covered 171 targets and 29 phenotypic
u                         screens, respectively. These numbers continue to grow as Pilot Phase projects are
h
r                         completed.
M
n                         Within this pilot phase, these NIH chemical probes were envisioned as having “adequate
u                         potency and adequate solubility to be useful for in vitro (e.g., cell-based experimentation”
c                         (Box 1), but requiring further “chemical modifications […] to confer the selectivity,
p                         pharmacokinetic, and metabolic properties required for in vivo use” . The criteria for a
t                         chemical probes evolved further, and currently requires a certain potency (up to 100 nM),
                          selectivity, aqueous solubility, and an improvement over existing probes for that target/assay
                          (Box 1),

                          Given the interdependence between the library being screened and a particular assay, not all

                          assays can yield novel chemical probes. Yet MLSCN scientists were tasked with nominating
I                         suitable chemical probes, based on the emergent results. Beyond these general guidelines for
H                         chemical probes, the Centers were given considerable autonomy in determining the quality
P                         and druggability necessary for a compound to be nominated as a probe.
A
u                         As output, this US$ 385 million initiative produced “a compound repository, a database and
h                         technology” as well as 64 chemical probes so far, with additional probes pending approval,
o                         which subjected it to critical analysisookmark not d. The initiative is also intended
M                         to nucleate discovery science throughout the research community by providing for
a                         individual investigators as well as centers to produce targets, probes, chemistry, novel
u                         hardware and novel software tools. In this Commentary, we seek two goals: First, we
s                         evaluate the quality of the NIH chemical probes, as perceived by a network of experts
r
t                         (‘wisdom of the crowd’ or ‘crowdsourcing’). Second, as the MLI enters a second phase, we
                          discuss strategies for increasing the quality and usefulness of nominated chemical probes
                          including some of those implemented already by the MLPCN.

              Molecular Confidence or Dubiosity

                          Molecular confidence or dubiosity (Box 2) is a subjective or objective property that can be
N                         attributed to small molecules in certain cycles of preclinical drug discovery. Its subjective
H                         aspect relates to what skilled medicinal chemists would describe as “gut reaction”, an
-                         intuitive or emotional response they experience when deciding which HTS hits, or
A                         confirmed actives, should be progressed further from a particular HTS assay. In its more
A                         subjective form, the scientific opinion of a medicinal chemist regarding the potential of a
u                         compound to be optimized into a clinical candidate drug is based on what Polanyi
h                                 4
r                         described as ‘tacit’ knowledge based on learning from experience. In its more objective
M                         aspect, molecular confidence or dubiosity is rooted in empirical observations, and it is
n                         usually derived by filtering HTS hits using a variety of parameters: i) a pre-determined list
u                         of substructures to remove reactive species , frequent hitters , or fluorescent
c                         compounds (as observed, e.g., via flow cytometry ); ii) a pre-determined list of toxicity
p                         filters , Lipinski’s rule-of(Ro5) and Pfizer-likrules, CNS penetration ,
t                         druglike4,1or leadlike,1properties; iii) criteria for enrichment or removal of
                          chemotypes based on similarity or dissimilarity to desired or unwanted chemicals; iv)
                          additional model-based filtfor down-stream drug safety issues such as hERG binding

                          (to rule out cardiac toxicity), cyto19rome P450 inhibition (to reduce the risk of drug-drug
                          interactions), and other potential antitargets ; v) all of the above. Thus, confidence or doubt
                          in a molecule stems from any number of undesired properties, and the potential to
N                         circumvent them within a reasonably small period (typically, less than six months), as
H                         judged by drug discovery scientists.
P
A             Crowdsourcing
A
t                         A key challenge in evaluating the quality of the chemical probes resulting from the MLI
o                         initiative is a lack of skilled experts who can individually determine, with a reasonable
r                         expectation of success, the quality of these probes. In the absence of a completely objective
M                         way to evaluate these chemical probes, we used the ‘wisdom of the crowd’ to crowdsource
n                         (Box 2) this evaluation to a team of eleven scientists with diverse backgrounds in small
s
r                         molecule discovery, most of them experienced in industrial drug discovery and currently
p                         engaged in both academia and industry. Their task? Express their level of confidence in the
t                         64 NIH chemical probes.

                          The UNM team, which did not vote, conducted exhaustive (as of October 10, 2008) queries
                          for each chemical probe; the results were synthesized in tabular format and provided to the

                              Nat Chem Biol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 March 13.
           Oprea et al.                                                                        Page 4

                         voting group. The “crowdsourced group” (CSG) was then asked to evaluate these probes in
                         the absence of any information related to the principal investigator (PI) or the institution that
N                        performed the assay and proposed the chemical probe. As a final step to ensure a blind
H                        evaluation, voters were asked not to use PubChem or any other database during the
-
A                        evaluation.
A                        We anticipate that this crowdsourcing approach will accomplish two goals: i) to address the
u
h                        question “what is the quality of the output” given the magnitude of the investment in the
r                        MLI; and ii) to provide an individual, analytical, overview of these probes from well-known
M                        experts in preclinical drug discovery.
n
u                        Last but not least, each of the CSG experts was informed that their individual contribution
c                        would be made available as Supplementary Information, and could potentially serve as the
p                        basis of a retrospective analysis in a decade – a period of time judged by most to be ample
t                        enough to confirm (or not) the quality of these chemical probes for the targets for which
                         they were proposed.

             Confidence scores

                         Since molecular confidence is neither exact nor accurate, the NIH chemical probes
                         evaluation was performed on a qualitative ranking of 0 (high confidence, low dubiosity) to
I                        10 (low confidence, high dubiosity), as described in Box 3. Of the 64 probes, 16 (25%) were
-                        evaluated as having low confidence or high dubiosity, i.e., their empirical rank scores are
A                        between 5 and 6; 16 probes (25%) were assigned “medium”, i.e., their empirical rank scores
A                        are 3 or 4; while half the probes (32) were considered “high in confidence or low in
u                        dubiosity”, i.e., their score was ranked between 0 and 2. A visual overview of the individual
h                        confidence scores is provided as a heatmap in Fig. 1. Exact scores, together with comments
r
M                        inserted by the 11 members of the voting group, are provided as Supplementary Table 1.
n
u                        For some probes, most of the CSG members were in agreement (horizontal lines that are
c                        predominantly one color in Fig. 1). Such consensus implies that some of these molecules
p                        should perhaps not have been nominated as probes, e.g., where predominantly red and
t                        orange lines are found). Eight probes ranked lowest in confidence (six), and had a median
                         score of 5 or higher. The CSG experts are in agreement that these structures should not have
                         been nominated as chemical probes since their bioactivity spectrum is quite non-specific,
                         making them useful only under carefully controlled biochemical conditions. Some of them
                         share a polyphenolic, dye character: Alizarin Yellow (CID 5281855) and Myricetin (CID
                         5281672), and the diketone CID 665013. A known fungicide (Dazomet; CID 10788)
                         contains both an aminal and a thiourea group, while an immunosuppresant drug
I                        (azathioprine; CID 2265) is known to hydrolyze in vivo to 6-mercaptopurine, a thiol-
H                        reacting group. Idarubicin (CID 151582) is a well characterized cytotoxin. CSG members
P                        expressed concern that Ebselen (CID 3194) may be a high-liability compound, as reflected
A
u                        by its Se-N moiety. Compound CID 2980973 may be a false positive due to its aliphatic
h                        ester / pyrimidinyl sulfone combination, while CID 16725315 is an acyl-hydrazine. Finally,
r                        two probes contain what toxicologists agree are troublesome chemical moieties (an

u                        In some cases, e.g., CID 665013, CSG questioned if compounds with such chemical
c                        liabilities (polyphenol and diketone) are indeed an improvement over state-of-the-art, since
p                        the intended target, HIV-1 Reverse Transcriptase, has already been targeted successfully by
t                        known drugs. Of the 16 low-confidence probes, 8 (12.5% of the total) are flagged for
                         potential toxicity alerts and one is a pesticide (Dazomet). Three (4.7%) of these probes are,
                         or have been, marketed drugs (Azathioprine, Idarubicin and Ebselen), while another 4
                         (6.25%) are perceived as druglike. The low confidence score awarded to these 16 chemical

                         probes is primarily owed to innate chemical structure liabilities as well as to potential or
                         known toxicity issues. However, one cannot a priori exclude the possibility that, under
N                        controlled conditions, they could serve as chemical probes. The CSG evaluation was based
H                        on the time- and data- limited information that was gathered as of October 10, 2008. Given
-
A                        that additional data have been collected since, some of these votes could change
A                        significantly, making these compounds more valuable as probes than they appear. Our goal
u                        is to preserve this “time capsule” of the voting process, not only to allow the community at
h                        large to discuss this with a ten-year timeframe in mind, but also to document steps in a
r                        decision-making process regarding the evaluation of these compounds.
M
n                        At the other end of the scale, 32 probes ranked high in confidence (low dubiosity): 14 probes
u                        were scored zero; 10 probes received a score of one; and 8 probes a score of two. The CSG
c                        has higher confidence in the overall qualities of these chemical probes (in particular those
p                        ranked 0 and 1), although most of them are likely to encounter downstream liabilities,
t                        should they be chosen as starting points for drug discovery. Of the 32 high confidence
                         chemical probes, 14 (21.88%) are flagged for potential toxicity alerts, 17 (26.56%) are
                         perceived as druglike and one (1.56%) is a marketed drug (Benzbromarone). The high-
                         confidence, low-dubiosity perception attributed to half (32) of the chemical probes is
                         primarily rooted in their apparent lack of immediate chemical liabilities. Although 12
                         (18.75%) of them are aromatic amines, this potential mutagenicity risk was not deemed

I                        relevant at the chemical probe stage by the CSG.

A            Can we bring objectivity to this process?
A
u                        One of the frustrating aspects of chemical probe evaluation is the lack of an objective
h                        function, or metric, by which their quality can be judged. How did the few empirical criteria
r                        for chemical probes correlate with the results of the voting gro20? Potency for the
M                        designated target and the estimated aqueous solubility (computed via ALOGPS ) were
n                        central to the NIH requirements (Probe 2.0, Box 1). Current NIH guidelines mandate that
u                        probes should have affinity below 100 nM (Probe 3.0, Box 1). Yet 45 out of 64 probes
c                        (70.3%) have activity above 100 nM, with 3 probes above 10 μM. Among high-confidence,
p                        low-dubiosity probes, 11 (17.2% of the total) have potency below 100 nM, and another 13
t                        (20.3%) are between 100 nM and 1 μM. Since 7 of the 17 low-confidence, high-dubiosity
                         probes were reported as having bioactivity of 100 nM or lower, while 8 high confidence and
                         11 medium confidence probes have activity worse than 1 μM, it appears that target potency
                         is regarded as a tunable parameter, i.e., one that can be further optimized. Although 70% of
                         the probes would not meet the current (Probe 3.0) activity cut-off, this aspect should to be
                         regarded in the context of the pilot phase (MLI), where fewer resources were available to

I                        meet this desirable goal. As the production phase proceeds, no doubt more medicinal
H                        chemistry resources will be allocated for improving affinity and selectivity. However,
P                        potency was deemed as less important in both the MLSCN nomination process, and in our
A                        own CSG evaluation. In this context, perhaps the NIH should consider reverting to Probe 2.0
u                        criteria with respect to affinity.
h
r                        The lack of an apparent relationship between activity vs. computed solubility is shown in
M                        Fig. 2. All probes except one low confidence probe have estimated (ALOGPS) solubility
a                        above 1 μM, so this criterion was largely met, but does not distinguish high from low ranked
u                        probes. Even the Ro5 criteria , graphically summarized in Fig. 3, fail to discriminate
c                        between low and high probes. Sixty chemical probes violate none of the Ro5 criteria, while
p                        two violate one rule. Only two probes are outside the Ro5 parameters – indicative perhaps of
t                        the profound effect that Ro5 criteria had on the lead and drug discovery community. These
                         two exceptions are peptidomimetic Cathepsin L inhibitors that owe their low confidence
                         score in part to an acyl-hydrazine moiety. By setting the polar surface area (PSA) value

                         probes, as well as 9 low confidence probes (75% of the total) satisfy the condition PSA ≤ 97

h
r                        Having completed the pilot phase (MLSCN), the NIH Molecular Libraries Program (MLP)
M                        moved into the production phase by launching the Molecular Libraries Probe Production
a                        Centers Network (MLPCN) in September 2008. MLPCN aims to explore the interaction
u                        between small molecules and biological function at the molecular, cellular and in vivo
c                        levels, by encouraging biomedical researchers to combine large-scale screening with
p                        medicinal chemistry and informatics, in order to identify chemical probes to study the
t                        functions of genes, cells, and biochemical pathways. The MLPCN has four Comprehensive
                         Centers (Broad, Burnham, NCGC, and Scripps) that will provide all 3 types of services
                         (assay, cheminformatics/informatics, and medicinal chemistry); three Specialized Screening
                         Centers (Johns Hopkins, SRI, and UNM), focused on specific assay technologies and

                         informatics; and two Specialized Chemistry Centers (Kansas and Vanderbilt), which will
                         provide medicinal chemistry and cheminformatics support for chemical probe optimization.
N
H                        Since low confidence was expressed in only 25% of the MLSCN chemical probes, we
P                        anticipate that through collective experience, chemical probe optimization will become an
A                        effective effort both in the Chemistry Centers, and in the Comprehensive Centers as well.
A                        We also envision a dynamic MLSMR library, where protein-reactive electrophiles, warhead-
t                        containing agents, known frequent hitters and aggregators will gradually disappear as our
o                        collective knowledge of artifact-generating chemicals and their negative impact on chemical
M                        biology interactions increases. Indeed, the fact that, despite more than a decade of
a                        cumulative experience from the pharmaceutical industry, such chemical structures are even
n                        found among the NIH chemical probes suggests that a rigorous evaluation of this problem,
s                        and how it influences the MLSMR library, is appropriate.
r
t                        With few exceptions, each MLSCN center had a share of “high” and “low” confidence

                         chemical probes. Low confidence probe nominations could perhaps be explained by a
                         variety of factors: Confidence in the chemists’ ability to overcome potential liabilities; no
                         known promiscuity at the time of filing the probe; or perhaps knowledge that the
                         perturbation of the intended biological target/process is not interfered with by these
                         liabilities. MLPCN has already instigated a more rigorous review process for vetting both
N                        probe development plans and probes themselves before they are accepted.
H
-                        From our experience, rigorous assessment of probe quality requires multiple communication
A                        rounds performed in an integrative manner involving: 1) chemical and drug informatics,
A                        including data mining, liabilities, virtual screening; 2) biology, from cellular processes to in
u                        vivo observations wherever possible and 3) chemistry, with respect to structure-activity
h                        analyses, synthesis planning, solubility and purity information. First and foremost, both the
r                        biology underlying the assay and the chemistry on which the probes are derived need to be

p                        need to be discussed in the context of structure-activity relationships . Finally, the
t                        biological activity of the putative probe should be confirmed by a third party, using fresh
                         samples of the chemical in question. These types of cycles of probe testing at individual

c
p                        Although objective functions to assess confidence, for both chemical probes and drug leads,
t                        are not available, we offer crowdsourcing as a cross-disciplinary alternative that pools
                         multiple levels of expertise from translational disciplines, to provide a more rigorous
                         chemical probe evaluation process within MLPCN. We anticipate that the progressive
                         removal of artifactual chemicals from the MLSMR, coupled with substantial improvements
                         in integrative communication tools and data-to-knowledge transformative technologies, will
                         result in significant improvements in chemical probe output. The 3 year MLI pilot phase
                         MLSCN was extended by one year, running in parallel with the MLPCN, giving the original

M                        currently under consideration via a consortium. As a community experiment, the MLI has
a                        not only delivered some interesting chemical probes, but also has altered the chemical

c                       First suggested by Jeff Howe , crowdsourcing refers to an outsourcing ‘open

t                       utilized by InnoCentive, YourEncore, and NineSigma, among others. In its simplest
                        form, problems are “crowdsourced” when a large (often unknown) group of solvers, the

                        “crowd”, is tasked with solving a problem or a particular set of problems. Often, the
                        crowd ranks the possible solutions and selects the optimal one(s). If crowdsourcing
                        occurs within a business parameter, the crowd28urcer owns the solution, while the best-
                        ranked solutions are compensated financially or otherwise.

N                                             THE EVALUATION OF CONFIDENCE
H
P                         By definition, low confidence would make us doubt the overall potential of a chemical
A                         probe related to, e.g., selectivity, its probability to act as promiscuous binder, as well as
A                         its future use as chemical probe and starting structure for lead discovery. Each voting
t                         member was asked to assign score, from 0 to 10, to each of the chemical probes
o                         according to their own judgment. However, they were under no obligation to score each
r                         probe; indeed, 2 voters did not score all chemicals (7.8% missing values). Higher scores
M                         imply higher dubiosity for the molecule, whereas low values imply higher confidence. To
n
u                         derive a qualitative evaluation of confidence, we applied the following steps and criteria:
c                             1.  Compute the average score across all voters; see Box 2 Table; note that the
p                                 average across all averaged scores was 4.54335
t
                              2.  Compute the median score across all voters; see Box 2 Table;

                              3.  Count the number of times a probe was scored above the average of all scores
                                  (4.54335), i.e., the “Score above average”; see also Box 2 Table;

                              4.  Empirically rank confidence by adding 3, if the Score Above Average or the
N                                 Score Median is above the 75% quartile; 2, if the Score Above Average or the
H                                 Score Median is between the median and 75% quartile; 1, if the Score Above
P                                 Average or the Score Median is between the 25% quartile and the median; and
A                                 adding 0 if the Score Above Average or the Score Median is below the 25%
A                                 quartile, respectively.
u
h                             5.  Qualitatively rank probes as follows: If the empirical rank is 5 or 6, “high
r                                 dubiosity” (16 probes); if it’s 3 or 4, “medium” (16 probes); if it’s 0, 1 or 2,
M                                 “high confidence” (32 probes). Further discussions are based on this qualitative

a                      orange indicate high dubiosity, yellow reflects medium values, whereas shades of blue
u                      indicate high confidence scores; grey indicates absence of score. The heatmap is sorted by

t                      columns reflect a chemical / HTS perspective, whereas the middle five columns are based on
                       cheminformatics tools and experience.
