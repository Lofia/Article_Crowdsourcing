  Abstract

  The thirteenth NETTAB workshop, NETTAB 2013, was devoted to semantic, social, and mobile applications for
  bioinformatics and biomedical laboratories.
  Topics included issues, methods, algorithms, and technologies for the design and development of tools and

  platforms able to provide semantic, social, and mobile applications supporting bioinformatics and the activities
  carried out in a biomedical laboratory.
  About 30 scientific contributions were presentedat NETTAB 2013, including keynote and tutorial talks, oral

  communications, and posters. Best contributions presented at the workshop were later submitted to a special
  Call for this Supplement.
  Here, we provide an overview of the workshop and introduce manuscripts that have been accepted for
  publication in this Supplement.
