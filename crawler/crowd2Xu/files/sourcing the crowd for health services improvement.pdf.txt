                                              study of share-your-experience sites in the US, UK, and the Netherlands. Data is taken primarily from

                                              shows that monitoring as “reﬂexive” behavior is not automatic, but is encouraged by website creators

                                              their performance; patients are expected to be more transparent about their choices, as well.
