                        Methods for conducting dietary assessment in the United States date back to the early twentieth
                        century. Methods of assessment encompassed dietary records, written and spoken dietary

                        recalls, FFQ using pencil and paper and more recently computer and internet applications.
                        Emerging innovations involve camera and mobile telephone technology to capture food and
                        meal images. This paper describes six projects sponsored by the United States National
                        Institutes of Health that use digital methods to improve food records and two mobile phone
                        applications using crowdsourcing. The techniques under development show promise for
                        improving accuracy of food records.
