  Abstract

  Background: This article provides a framework for disentangling the concept of participation, with emphasis on
  participation in genomic medicine. We have derived seven ‘dimensions’ of participation that are most frequently
  invoked in the extensive, heterogeneous literature on participation. To exemplify these dimensions, we use material

  from a database of 102 contemporary cases of participation, and focus here on cases specific to science and
  medicine. We describe the stakes of public participation in biomedical research, with a focus on genomic medicine
  and lay out the seven dimensions.

  Discussion: We single out five cases of participation that have particular relevance to the field of genomic
  medicine, we apply the seven dimensions to show how we can differentiate among forms of participation within

  this domain.
  Summary: We conclude with some provocations to researchers and some recommendations for taking variation in
  participation more seriously.
