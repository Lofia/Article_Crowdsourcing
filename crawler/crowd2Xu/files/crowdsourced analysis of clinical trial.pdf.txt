       progression profiles via k-means. Clusters predominantly contain slow (black), average (gray) or fast patients (red). Patients closest to the center of

       each cluster were selected to yield 14 representative patients. (b) Performance of 12 clinicians (red, “A” indicates the performance of their aggregated
       predictions) and two algorithms (blue) is assessed based on r.m.s. deviation (ordinate) and Pearson’s correlation (abscissa). Here, r.m.s. deviation

       and correlation are calculated based on the 14 representative patients. (c,d) The slope predictions (abscissa) as generated by algorithm 1 (c) and the

       (ordinate). The predicted classifications were assessed relative to a threshold (dashed line). Patients left or right of the threshold are assumed to be
       predicted fast or slow, respectively. Circles highlight incorrectly classified patients (d).
