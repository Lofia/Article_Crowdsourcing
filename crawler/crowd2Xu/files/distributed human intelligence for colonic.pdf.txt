true polyps (n = 31) and (b) false polyps (n = 237) in trial 1, illustrating the differences in the distribution of scores between true and false polyps.The detections are
also stratified according to difficulty, shown as stacked bars, illustrating the shift in score distributions as difficulty changes. Similar histograms were obtained for trial
