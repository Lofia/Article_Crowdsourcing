H
P               The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) recently released guidelines
A               regarding the reporting of incidental findings in sequencing data. Given the availability of Direct
A
t               to Consumer (DTC) genetic testing and the falling cost of whole exome and genome sequencing,
o               individuals will increasingly have the opportunity to analyze their own genomic data. We have
r               developed a web-based tool, PATH-SCAN, which annotates individual genomes and exomes for
M               ClinVar designated pathogenic variants found within the genes from the ACMG guidelines.
n
s               Because mutations in these genes predispose individuals to conditions with actionable outcomes,
r               our tool will allow individuals or researchers to identify potential risk variants in order to consult
p               physicians or genetic counselors for further evaluation. Moreover, our tool allows individuals to
t               anonymously submit their pathogenic burden, so that we can crowd source the collection of

                quantitative information regarding the frequency of these variants. We tested our tool on 1092
                publicly available genomes from the 1000 Genomes project, 163 genomes from the Personal
                Genome Project, and 15 genomes from a clinical genome sequencing research project. Excluding

                the most commonly seen variant in 1000 Genomes, about 20% of all genomes analyzed had a
I               ClinVar designated pathogenic variant that required further evaluation.

u
h                        The era of personalized genomics received a jumpstart in 2007, when 23andMe,

                          For example, the list includes BRCA1 and TNNI3, mutations in which can lead to breast
                          cancer and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, respectively. Currently, it is not known
                          exactlywhat percentage of individual genomes will carry such variants, and an
                          understanding of the pathogenic burden will allow researchers to better understand the

                          resources required to evaluate such variants. Here, we present a publicly available tool,
N                         PATH-SCAN, which annotates genomes for ClinVar designated pathogenic variants in the
H                         list of genes recommended by the ACMG.

A             2. Methods
t
o                         PATH-SCAN allows a researcher or individual to analyze and annotate individual exomes
M                         or genomes for a set of pathogenic variants identified in the ClinVar database in the genes
a                         put forward by the ACMG. These annotations are presented in a report with genomic
n
s                         information and links to additional information. Due to the consequences of many of these
r                         variants, security and privacy are mainstays of the PATH-SCAN program. PATH-SCAN
t                         maintains complete privacy by performing all analyses on an individual’s local machine,
                          similar to a previously described genotype analysis tool, INTERPRETOME. PATH-SCAN

                          offers an option to anonymously submit data to our research group allowing us to use crowd
                          sourcing to determine the prevalence of pathogenic variants found in the ACMG gene list.

              2.1.Pathogenic Variant Selection
N
H                         Pathogenic variants were selected from the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s
-                         (NCBI) ClinVar variant call file (VCF). From this database of variants, those variants with
A
A                         at least one submission as “pathogenic” were extracted and annotated with links to other
u                         clinically relevant databases. Since the ClinVar database is a collaborative database with
h                         potentially variable quality in individual variant results, we filtered out any variant that was
r                         tagged with a “variant suspect” code. A variant might be labeled as such for several reasons,
M
n                         including being called from an old genomic alignment or a suspected paralog From this list,
u                         we then extracted only the variants that mapped to the 57 genes listed in the ACMG report.
c                         Gene boundaries were determined using GRCh37.pIn total, ClinVar had records for
p                         994 variants designated as pathogenic across 57 genes. These variants are included in the
t
                          PATH-SCAN package. The original ClinVar VCF can be found here http://
                          www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/variation/docs/human_variation_vcf/. The use of other databases is

                         allowed in case an individual wishes to use an alternative database for annotation (see

A
A                        Our cross-platform program, PATH-SCAN, utilizes a database of 994 variants to scan
u                        personal genomes and annotate them. The annotations produced by PATH-SCAN are made
h                        available to the end user or researcher as a local html page with a simplified user interface
r                        for increased accessibility and transparency. To assist interpretation of this information and
M
n                        provide a model for future genome interpretation tools, each recognized variant and
u                        annotation is presented alongside links to relevant educational resources, including ClinVar,
c                        OMIM, and consolidated Gene Reviews from the National Center for Biotechnology
p                        Information (NCBI).
t
                         Crowd sourcing data collection was accomplished by making a submission link available

                         that transfers de-identified anonymous information back to our data collection server. In
                         order to prevent any privacy concerns regarding this data collection, PATH-SCAN only
                         transmits the total number of pathogenic variants annotated for each gene (e.g. the total
                         pathogenic burden per gene of an individual genome) as well as a unique key to prevent
I
-                        duplicate submissions from unwary users. Additional information such as ancestry is
A                        optional to transmit. The unique key is calculated by PATH-SCAN automatically by hashing
A                        the personal genome file using the SHA-2 family of cryptographic functions. In addition to
u                        these security measures, a privacy message is presented before the user can submit their
h
r                        data. For the personal genomes we had direct access to, the full annotations made by PATH-
M                        SCAN were used to collect data on individual diseases and variants as well as aggregate
n                        distributions of pathogenic variants across individuals.
u
c                        PATH-SCAN is a command line utility that was developed in Python 2.7.5 and has no
p
t                        external dependencies. The PATH-SCAN program comes pre-loaded with the existing
                         database of pathogenic variants. We also have the ability to load updated databases pending
                         re-releases of the ACMG recommendation or for custom made variant databases. PATH-
                         SCAN will automatically detect and process variant call files (VCFs), tab-separated variant

                         (TSV) files from Complete Genomics, and SNP chip results from 23andMe. Because
                         23andMe only genotypes SNPs, PATH-SCAN will not scan data in this form for indels. For
I                        a whole genome VCF file that is 336 MB, PATH-SCAN runs in 24 seconds on a machine

                         By filtering ClinVar for variants with evidence of pathogenicity in the subset of ACMG
                         guideline genes, we selected 994 variants that our tool evaluates. These variants include 651
                         single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 343 small insertions/deletions (indels). 65.5%

N                        of the pathogenic variants evaluated were SNPs, evenly distributed across all 12 non-
H                        synonymous nucleotide-to-nucleotide transversions. Variants were not evenly distributed
P                        across the 57 genes, with BRCA1 and BRCA2 having the largest number of variants (Figure

A                        potentially pathogenic and actionable variants. Furthermore, we have applied this tool on
u                        existing datasets and have made it available for public use in order to gauge the frequency
h
r                        that potentially pathogenic variants in the ACMG genes are observed.
M
n            4.1.Variant Selection
u
c                        One of the major issues was outlined in the original ACMG report: “The Working Group
p                        recognized that there is no single database currently available that represents an accurately
t                        curated compendium of known pathogenic variants, nor is there an automated algorithm to
                         identify all novel variants meeting criteria for pathogenicity.” For the purposes of this

                         project, we selected the ClinVar database, because the variants submitted come directly
                         from patient data. We selected only those variants that had at least one submission indicating
                         that the variant was pathogenic in nature. A limitation of this approach is the inclusion of
                         variants that may have conflicting submissions listing the variant as pathogenic and benign,
I
H                        and issues such as sample size and study population can contribute to this confusion about
P                        variant interpretation. However, the ClinVar curators are making an effort to review
A                        submissions. We recognize that variants labeled as pathogenic by ClinVar may not be
u                        viewed as so when analyzed by a clinical laboratory, genetic counselor, or clinician.
h
r                        However, their presence in a genome or exome will warrant evaluation in order to determine
M                        if they should be acted upon. Thus, understanding the frequency of such variants will allow
a                        us to draw conclusions about the amount of resources required to properly vet variants in the
u                        ACMG guidelines genes.
c
p                        Another limitation of our database choice is that we do not pick up novel, rare, or private
t
                         mutations that are not currently annotated in ClinVar. However, since we could not reliably
                         make any inference about the pathogenicity of such variants, we selected not to include them

                          in our publicly available tool. Finally, because most research studies are done in individuals

                          of European descent, there is likely an overrepresentation of variants that are pathogenic in
I                         populations of European descent.
-
P                         We do note that the pathogenic variants in the ClinVar database are not evenly distributed
A                         between genes. The number of pathogenic variants reported in a gene can be influenced by
u
h                         several factors – including the length of the gene, the amount of selective pressure, and the
r                         number of studies focusing on the gene. Interestingly, BRCA1 and BRCA2 had the largest
M                         number of pathogenic variants. This could be due to the extensive studies on these genes and
a                         their role in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.

p             4.2.Findings in the 1000 Genomes Data and Personal Genomes Project
t                         Our successful application of PATH-SCAN to the 1000 Genomes data sets confirmed the

                          ability of our tool to process whole genomes. In 1092 low pass genomes, 566 individuals
                          had a pathogenic variant in one of the ACMG genes.

                          The most observed variant was rs1805124 (H558R), seen in 41.2% of individuals. The
                          population allele frequency of this variant is about 20% in 1000 Genomes. This is a prime
N
H                         example of the challenge with implementing an automatic system to follow up on potentially
P                         pathogenic variants in ACMG genes. SCN5A H558R has been associated with atrial
A                         fibrillation and changes in cardiac conducMultiple studies have also demonstrated
A
t                         that the presence of this variant combined with other rare SCN5A variants perturbs heart
o                         electrophysiology.1However, there are also studies in which this variant may mitigate
M                         the effects of a particular mutation that causes BrugadaFinally, it should be
a                         noted that this variant is quite common in the general population. As Klitzman et al. noted in
n
s                         response to the ACMG Guidelines, ‘pathogenic’ variants with a high frequency in the
r                         population but a low corresponding disease prevalence may cause unnecessary alarm.
t                         Because this variant can affect disease risk when other mutations are also present, its

                          presence would require evaluation of the entire gene and family history by an experienced
                          genetic counselor or clinician. This example supports the need for comprehensive follow up
                          of variants that are thought to be pathogenic.

                          Excluding rs1805124 (H558R), 233 individuals out of 1092 carried an incidental finding.
N
H                         These other variants were less common, with less than 5% of individuals carrying any single
-                         variant. These variants included risks for such conditions as colon cancer (rs1801166) and
A                         cardiomyopathy (rs121912998), which can profoundly impact health and lifestyle.
A
u                         When we looked across the populations, we saw that there were differences in the average
h
r                         number of variants per person. Because many of these variants were derived from studies
M                         done in individuals of European ancestry, differences could be attributed to this selection
n                         bias.4Furthermore, different populations likely have different variants driving their total
u                         variant counts due to differences in population allele frequency. In the case of LWK, which
c
p                         had a very low average variant per person count when the most common variant was
t                         removed, we are likely missing population specific pathogenic variants. Another complex
                          issue brought up by ancestry is pathogenicity – variants that may be causative and
                          pathogenic in one population may not have the same penetrance or impact in another.

                         With our crowdsourcing tool, ancestry will be an option that individuals can submit; we

N                        hope that this will allow us to get a more accurate picture of the distribution of these variants
H                        across individuals of different and mixed ancestries.
-
A                        We also note that since these are low coverage genomes (~4x), some variants reported could
A                        be false. Genomes sequenced to clinical standards would have much higher coverage and
u                        have more confident calls. Thus, this data may be skewed by false positives.
h
r
M                        To evaluate our tool on Complete Genomics data and higher coverage genomes, we applied
n                        PATH-SCAN to 163 genomes made publicly available from the Personal Genomes Project.
u                        Once again, rs1805124 (H558R) was the most common variant. However, excluding this
c                        variant, 17% of genomes had variants of interest. Overrepresentation of certain variants may
p
t                        occur if individuals in the Personal Genome Project are related. Several of these variants
                         were low frequency at a population level, as they did not appear in the 1000 Genomes data.
                         Our tool assists in the evaluation of such variants by pinpointing them within minutes of
                         scanning a genome.


             4.3.Using PATH-SCAN on Clinical Genomes
I                        Finally, we ran PATH-SCAN on a clinical genome sequencing cohort of fifteen individuals.
-
A                        The output provided a starting point for the evaluation of variants in the project. Previously,
A                        people used a gene-based approach to look at all variants in a gene of interest and then used
u                        manual curation to select variants for further evaluation.
h
r            4.4.PATH-SCAN as a quantitative evaluation tool
M
n                        PATH-SCAN is a publicly available tool; individuals using it can choose to anonymously
u                        submit their pathogenic burden (i.e. the number of variants seen in their genome) and
c
p                        ancestry to our server. Over time, we aim to use crowdsourcing to get a more accurate
t                        number of how often potentially pathogenic variants are seen and how ancestry affects these
                         numbers.

                         The current iteration of our tool serves as the foundation for additional functionalities in

                         development. Because ClinVar designated pathogenic variants may not truly be pathogenic,
                         we are currently working on adding variant effect prediction scores, such as PolyPhen and
I                        SIFT to our tool.4
H
P                        We have found that even with the most common pathogenic variant removed, a substantial
A                        percentage of individuals still carry variants in ACMG guidelines genes that require
u
h                        additional investigation. Of course, due to the limitations of the ClinVar database, many of
r                        these variants may be benign. However, we feel that each variant needs to be evaluated in
M                        the context of other mutations, clinical history, and family history by a clinician or genetic
a                        counselor. While not all of these variants may be ultimately reported back, evaluating these
u
c                        variants will require additional resources. Thus, understanding how often such variants
p                        occur is key to assessing the resource utilization of following the ACMG Guidelines. In the
t                        past few months, there has much debate surrounding the ACMG Guidelines and their
                         implementation. Our tool PATH-SCAN aims to streamline the identification of variants in
