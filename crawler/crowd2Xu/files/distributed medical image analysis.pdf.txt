    Abstract

    In this work we investigate whether the innate visual recognition and learning capabilities of untrained humans can be used
    in conducting reliable microscopic analysis of biomedical samples toward diagnosis. For this purpose, we designed

    entertaining digital games that are interfaced with artificial learning and processing back-ends to demonstrate that in the
    case of binary medical diagnostics decisions (e.g., infected vs. uninfected), with the use of crowd-sourced games it is
    possible to approach the accuracy of medical experts in making such diagnoses. Specifically, using non-expert gamers we

    report diagnosis of malaria infected red blood cells with an accuracy that is within 1.25% of the diagnostics decisions made
    by a trained medical professional.

world are transmitted to data centres where they are pre-processed and digitally distributed among gamers, which in turn diagnose and transmit
their responses back. These individual results of the gamers are then fused toward a final diagnosis, the result of which is transmitted back to the

Figure 5. The Crowd Effect: gamer performance results for experiment #5. The plots show the worst case scenarios where the diagnoses

from the worst performing players are used to generate an overall diagnosis for each RBC in the game. Note that the specificity (or true negative rate)
is always very high for the gamers, and does not improve much as more gamers are added to the mix. However, the sensitivity (or true positive rate)
benefits the most as more players are added, and climbs above 95% once 15-gamers form the crowd. The accuracy also increases as more players are
added, but since it reflects both the specificity and the sensitivity its increase is not as drastic as that of the sensitivity.
