Abstract: To develop a strategy for how to better engage young people in decision-making processes on
AIDS, UNAIDS launched the participatory online policy project CrowdOutAIDS in 2011. A total of
3,497 young people aged 15–29 from 79 countries signed up to nine online forums, and volunteers
recruited through the online platform hosted 39 community-based offline forums with an additional
1,605 participants. This article describes the participatory approach of using social media and
crowdsourcing solutions to integrate youth perspectives into strategy and policy processes. In these forums,
youth consistently identified the need to change the way sex and relationships are dealt with through
changing how sex is talked about, putting comprehensive sexuality education in place, and overcoming

social and cultural taboos. The outcome document recommended three major priorities: dispel taboos
surrounding sex and sexuality, eliminate stigma and discrimination against young people living with HIV,
and remove social and legal barriers. Six strategic actions were also recommended: strengthen young
people’s skills for effective leadership, ensure full youth participation in the AIDS response, increase
access to HIV-related information, strengthen strategic networks, increase UNAIDS’s outreach to young
people, and increase young people’s access to financial support. Through leveraging social media and
crowdsourcing, it is possible to integrate grassroots perspectives from across the globe into a new model
of engagement and participation, which should be further explored for community empowerment and

mobilization. © 2013 Reproductive Health Matters
