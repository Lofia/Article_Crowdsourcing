Abstract

Background: This article describes capture of biological information using a hybrid ap-
proach that combines natural language processing to extract biological entities and

crowdsourcing with annotators recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk to judge correct-
ness of candidate biological relations. These techniques were applied to extract gene–

mutation relations from biomedical abstracts with the goal of supporting production
scale capture of gene–mutation–disease ﬁndings as an open source resource for person-

alized medicine. Results: The hybrid system could be conﬁgured to provide good
performance for gene–mutation extraction (precision ▯82%; recall ▯70% against an

expert-generated gold standard) at a cost of $0.76 per abstract. This demonstrates that
crowd labor platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk can be used to recruit quality

annotators, even in an application requiring subject matter expertise; aggregated Turker
judgments for gene–mutation relations exceeded 90% accuracy. Over half of the preci-
sion errors were due to mismatches against the gold standard hidden from annotator

view (e.g. incorrect EntrezGene identiﬁer or incorrect mutation position extracted), or in-
complete task instructions (e.g. the need to exclude nonhuman mutations). Conclusions:

The hybrid curation model provides a readily scalable cost-effective approach to

   Of the 94 missing concept triples in Table 8 for the

full set of HITs (444 gold standard triples—350 Turker

mutation position information and 37 were due to missing

stop codon or synonymous mutations (neither of which are

recognized by the version of EMU used for the
experiment).



Cost of curation


The ultimate goal of this research was to develop an accur-
ate, scalable, cost-effective method to capture gene–muta-

tion relations (and ultimately gene–mutation–disease
relations) in an open source repository. The initial results

of both experiments showed promise in terms of through-
