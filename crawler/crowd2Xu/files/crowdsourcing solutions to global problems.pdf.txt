            Crowdsourcing can be defined as the outsourcing of
            tasks traditionally performed by specific individuals
            to an undefined large group of people or a community
            (crowd) through an open call for collaboration.


            Nearly every global issue today—from air and
            water quality to the governance of global financial
            services—could benefit as a result of having a
            larger crowd of informed individuals helping to
            generate, vet and implement new solutions.


            Consider these examples: the rapidly growing
            practice of crisis mapping, the use of crowdsourcing
            to develop global public policy, or epidemiological
            experimentation with crowdsourced science to
            improve the detection of public health threats.

     expertise and             systematize or analyze large amounts of data (as in citizen science),
     resources required        for example. With a well-designed process, crowdsourcing can
                               speed the assembly of data, expertise and resources required

     by allowing people
     and organizations         The paradigmatic example of crowdsourcing is Wikipedia, the world’s
                               largest and most dynamic encyclopedia by some distance. With over
     to collaborate            4 million English language articles, Wikipedia is more than 30 times

     freely and openly         the size of its closest commercial analogue, Encyclopedia Britannica
     across disciplinary       (with its total of 120,000 entries). Unlike Britannica, however,
                               Wikipedia does not have a large full time workforce producing its
     and geo-graphic           product and it operates on a fraction of the budget. The free online
     boundaries.               encyclopedia’s skeleton staff of 10 full-time employees is augmented
                               by millions of volunteer editors who perform the vast majority of
                    ”          the content creation. In other words, most of Wikipedia’s human
                               capital is outside the boundaries of its organization and rather than
                               fiercely protecting its IP, Wikipedia actively encourages users to edit
                               and contribute. The secret to success has been Wikipedia’s ability
                               to break down complex tasks into manageable chunks and provide
                               knowledgeable and motivated contributors with a platform to
                               organize into self-policing communities.

                               Since the success of Wikipedia, crowdsourcing has become
                               increasingly commonplace in business, government and society.
                               Once closed and secretive companies like P&G, for example, now
                               reach beyond their corporate boundaries to co-innovate hundreds

                               of new products with thousands of external partners, shaving over
                               $1 billion off their annual R&D costs as a result. Meanwhile Amazon,
                               Google and Apple have pioneered highly successful open platform
                               strategies to engender on-the-fly partnerships with very large
                               communities of freelance software coders that have collectively
                               developed hundreds of thousands of applications for their popular
                               mobile technology platforms, giving customers access to staggering
                               levels of continuous innovation.

                               In government, crowdsourcing has been used successfully to
                               address everything from sourcing a new platform to enable
                               medical researchers to analyze regional disparities in cancer rates
                               to inventing a high-efficiency 10-watt light bulb that emits the
                               same level of light as a 60W incandescent. Even relatively complex
                               and labor intensive tasks have been tackled with amazing speed

                              and ingenuity—just witness what happened in Estonia in May, 2008. When
                              Estonians regained independence from the former Soviet Union in 1991, they

                              not only acquired new political freedoms, they inherited a mass of rubbish—
                              thousands and thousands of tons of it scattered across illegal dumping
                              sites around the country. When concerned citizens decided that the time
                              had come to clean it up, they turned not to the government, but to tens of

                              thousands of their peers. Using a combination of global positioning systems
                              and Google Maps, two entrepreneurs (Skype guru Ahti Heinla and Microlink
                              and Delfi founder Rainer Nolvak) enlisted volunteers to plot the location of

                              over 10,000 illegal dumpsites, including detailed descriptions and photos. In
                              Phase II, they initiated a mass cleanup all of the illegal sites in one day, with
                              some 50,000 people scouring fields, streets, forests and riverbanks across
                              the country picking up everything from tractor batteries to paint tins. Much

                              of this junk was ferried to central dumps, often in the vehicles of volunteers.

                              Problem Solving


                              If 50,000 Estonians can cleanup their country (albeit a relatively small one)
                              in one day, what else could motivated individuals contribute to global

                              problem solving networks and initiatives? Tiina Urm, a spokesperson for
                              the initiative, put it this way: “It is not really about the rubbish. It is about
                              changing people’s mindsets. Next year it might be something else.”  3 Indeed,

                              the idea behind crowdsourcing global problem solving is that just about
                              every global issue today—from air and water quality to the governance of
                              global financial services—could benefit as a result of having a larger crowd of
                              informed individuals helping to generate, vet and implement new solutions—

                              solutions that can be used to educate the public, enhance science, inform
                              public policy-making or advance myriad other objectives. One can quite
                              easily imagine countless arenas where, if asked, experts and enthusiasts
                              would contribute:


                                      •	   Environmental authorities that gather and analyze
                                           data about global air quality would benefit from more

                                           contributions from local sources and could engage local
                                           communities to help them understand the implications of
                                           data they are observing.

                                           diagnostics application that connects health care

                                           workers in under-served regions to medical specialists
                                           could post a public challenge that invites contributions
                                           from a growing international community of social-

     the educated             Of course, in an age where growing numbers of people report feeling highly
                              timepressured, it’s worth asking whether such global crowdsourcing projects
     population on            arelikelytocometo fruition. According to some leading sociologists, there
     the planet has           is reason to be optimistic. Although people still cite “time scarcity” as the
                              number one reason for not volunteering or contributing to public good
     something like           projects, author and New York University professor Clay Shirky argues that
     a trillion hours a       our sense of feeling constantly time-pressured is vastly exaggerated. Shirky
                              makes the observation that increases in GDP, educational attainment and
     year of free time        lifespan since the Second World War have, in fact, produced a massive
     to spend doing           abundance of free time.

     things they care         Thanks to the advent of the 40-hour workweek, the educated population
     about.                   on the planet has something like a trillion hours a year of free time to
                              spend doing things they care about. The problem is that most of our
             ”                surplustime is absorbed by television. Americans spend some two hundred
                              billion hours watching sitcoms every year and nine billion hours playing
                              solitaire. Yet, according to Shirky’s estimates, only a small proportion of
                              the public would need to become more civically engaged to make a big
                              difference. A back of the envelope calculation suggests Wikipedia was built
                              with roughly 1 percent of the man-hours that Americans spend watching
                              TV every year (the rough equivalent 100 million hours of thought). If even a
                              fraction of our surplus time could be directed to the creation of other digital
                              public goods, the connected population could be producing hundreds
                              of Wikipedia-like projects every year or contributing regularly to global
                              problem solving initiatives.

                                such a way that the average individual can make a meaningful difference?

                                Again, the answer is affirmative. In fact, the best crowdsourcing projects
                                break large projects or problems down into manageable, “bite-sized” tasks,
                                so even time-pressured people can still contribute. Social innovators Jacob

                                people don’t have any time, it’s that they don’t have large chunks available

                                to commit to larger tasks. In addition to watching television, they discovered
                                that Americans spend 4.6 hours a week playing video games, 51 minutes
                                riding public transportation to and from work everyday, 18 minutes in an

                                airport security lane, and half an hour on average standing in line at the
                                post office. Colker and Rigby reckoned that all of this latent time could be

                                harnessed and given a social purpose. So they designed Sparked, a micro-
                                volunteering platform that allows supporters to use their mobile phone to
                                transform their spare-time into social action. For example, someone with

                                foreign language skills can help translate a non-profit’s website into another
                                language, or someone with a passion for birds can help the Cornell Lab of
                                                                                         6

                                In short, the potential scope for crowdsourcing in global problem solving,
                                while not limitless, is very large relative to its deployment today. Todd Park,

                                who recently became Chief Technology Officer at the White House, calls
                                crowdsourcing “a very exciting new tool that governments and other sectors
                                can use to get better results at a lower cost.” “You can greatly broaden
                                                                                                               7
                                and deepen the range of players that can help solve the problem,” he says.
                                Park did pioneering work in the government crowdsourcing arena during his

                                tenure at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and brought
                                his appreciation of prize-based competitions as a method to solve tough
                                problems to the White House. “You draw in unusual suspects along with

                                    said Park, who added that prizes can often be the initial draw, but often,
                                                                                                               9
                                    the challenge of solving a problem keeps developers interested. There
                                    are limitations to the effectiveness of crowdsourcing that will be discussed
                                    below, but three examples help illustrate the breadth of possibilities that

                                    crowdsourcing platforms open up for global problem solving. The first
                                    example is drawn from the rapidly growing field of crisis mapping, where

                                    dispersed teams of individuals help collect and analyze information in a crisis
                                    situation. The second example showcases the use of crowdsourcing to
                                    develop global public policy. A third example is drawn from epidemiology,

                                    where researchers are experimenting with crowdsourced science as a way
                                    to improve the detection of public health threats (see the table below for a

     official mandates,       On January 12, a devastating earthquake struck Haiti, causing a chain
     formal command           of horrific events that few people will soon forget. The magnitude 7.0
                              earthquake that struck near Port-Au-Prince inflicted horrendous damage,
     structures,              causing more human misery and economic damage than any earthquake
     or elaborate             on record. In a mere 45 seconds of seismic contortions, an astonishing 15%
                              of the nation’s population—1.5 million people—was rendered homeless.
     communication            Tens of thousands were dead, and hundreds of thousands more were
     protocols; just          injured. Any semblance of the usual infrastructure emergency crews
                              depend on (roads, hospitals, water, sanitation, electrical power and
     a loose group            communication networks) was obliterated. Vast regions of the
     of committed             two-hundred-and-fifty year old city toppled.

     individuals under        The ruthless and indiscriminate wrath of nature’s forces, however, was
     effective grassroots     just a prelude to the real misery. Circumstances on the ground made
                              life astonishingly difficult for first responders. The sea and airports were
     leadership               congested and there were too few trucks to transport supplies and no safe
     harnessing               place to store them. No one—not the army, the government, or the aid
                              community—had a clear picture of the full scale of the catastrophe unfolding
     rudimentary open         around them. There was confusion about precisely what supplies had been
     source technologies      received, and in which quantities. There was also a lack of coordination
                              among aid agencies and other entities about which people and areas to
     to help those            prioritize and how to overcome this logistical nightmare. This initial lack
     in need.                 of coordination, in turn, left Haiti’s earthquake victims (already amongst the
                              poorest people in the world) utterly destitute, without food, water or clothing,
               ”              separated from their loved ones, and many in desperate need of medical
                              attention. Yet, out of the rubble, and in the face of tremendous suffering,
                              came a powerful story of how an ad-hoc team of volunteers from around the

                              world came together to concoct an information management solution that
                              far surpassed anything the official crisis response team had mustered—a
                              team that included the world’s largest emergency relief organizations, the US
                              State Department and even the US Army.

                              At the heart of the volunteer effort was a small Kenyan-born organization
                              called Ushahidi whose crisis mapping site allows users to submit eyewitness
                              accounts or other relevant information in a disaster situation via e-mail, text
                              or Twitter—and then visualize the frequency and distribution of these events
                              on a map. Ory Okolloh, a prominent Kenyan lawyer and blogger, first came
                              up with the idea in 2007 when violence erupted in the aftermath of Kenya’s
                              disputed election. After hearing many disturbing reports of rape, looting and
                              murder from friends and family across the country, she suspected that the
                              government and the official news agencies were grossly underreporting the
                              violence. The proof came when her own vivid reporting on her blog Kenyan
                              Pundit triggered a flood of emails and texts from hundreds of Kenyanswho
                              had witnessed or experienced violence first hand. The volume of reports soon

                              overwhelmed Okolloh’s ability to authenticate and document them using

                                grants, official mandates, formal command structures, or elaborate

                                communication protocols—just a loose group of committed individuals
                                under effective grassroots leadership harnessing rudimentary open source
                                technologies to help those in need.


                                When disaster struck Haiti two years later, Ushahidi’s director of crisis

                                mapping, Patrick Meier, sprung into action. Meier had been enjoying a quiet
                                evening watching the news at his home in Boston. It was 7:00pm when he
                                first learned about the earthquake. By 7:20, he’d contacted a colleague in

                                Atlanta. By 7:40, the two were setting up a dedicated site for Haiti on the
                                Ushahidi platform. By 8, they were gathering intelligence from everywhere, in
                                a global effort to crowdsource assistance for Haiti.


                                Since the majority of incoming text messages were in Creole, they needed

                                a translation service. And since most reports lacked sufficient location details,
                                they needed a way to quickly identify the GPS coordinates so that incidents

                                could be mapped as accurately as possible. So Meier reached out to dozens of
                                Haitian communities for help, including the large diaspora in Boston.

                                Soon hundreds of volunteers around the world were usingUshahidi-Haiti
                                to translate, categorize and geo-locate urgent life-and-death text messages

                                in real-time. Many of the volunteers spent weeks on their laptops in a dimly
                                -lit school basement in Boston that Meier converted into a makeshift
                                situation room.


                                Although located some 1,640 miles from the scene, the volunteer crisis

                                mappers used Skype to relay critical information about the location of
                                potential survivors to search and rescue teams on the ground in Port-au-
                                Prince. They responded to requests from the World Food Program and the

                                USS Aircraft Carrier Vinson in the middle of the night. And to better link calls
                                with specific GPS coordinates, they even got direct access to Digital Globe’s

                                high-resolution satellite imagery and to the US Army’s video footage from
                                military drones. By the time Meier’s group had honed their process, text
                                messages were being translated into English and posted online just minutes

                                after they left a mobile phone in Haiti. And as a result of their dedication,
                                many lives were saved. Ushahidi’s crisis mappers found themselves center
                                stage in one of the largest relief operations in history.


                                .“If a relief worker from the Red Cross has a field office in the neighborhood of

                                Delmas,” says Meier, “they could subscribe to Ushahidi to receive information
                                on all reports originating from their immediate vicinity by specifying a
                                radius.” Not only were responders able to specify their geographic area of

                                interest, but they could also select the type of alert, say collapsed buildings,
                                medical emergencies, food shortages, or looting. Now, as the focus shifts from

                                crisis relief to rebuilding in the years to come, Meier thinks Ushahidi’s crisis
                                mapping tools could just as readily be used by Haitians to hold crisis-relief
                                organizations, private contractors and the local government accountable for

                                higher standards than have been the norm during the many years of failed
                                efforts to lift the impoverished Caribbean nation out of poverty.




                                A New Paradigm for Disaster Relief and Humanitarian Assistance
                                The old crisis management paradigm was one-to-many: big institutions and

                                aid work-ers jet into a crisis and dispense aid with the limited information
                                they have. Most aid organizations don’t have good systems for sharing
                                information, and certainly don’t like ceding turf or marching to the beat

                                of another organization’s drum. The resulting fragmentation leads to poor
                                decision-making, redundancy and confusion, and often to wasted money and
                                                        12
                                wasted opportunities.    To make matters worse, the end recipients of disaster
                                relief are almost always treated as helpless victims and passive consumers
                                of other people’s charity. This makes for perversely compelling television

                                drama (so-called disaster porn temporarily boosted CNN’s ratings by 95%),
                                but it fails miserably in delivering results. Indeed a report produced by the
                                International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies following

                                the international community’s response to the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami
                                highlighted the need for better coordination as well as victim participation in
                                future disaster relief efforts to help ensure the needs and interests of disaster
                                                                                                   13

     To get assistance

“    to people
     impacted by

     disasters, FEMA
     used to rely

     exclusively on
     reports from

     on-the-ground
     inspectors.

     Today they use
     satellite imagery,

     crowdsourcing
     and analytics to                                                    14

     determine which
     areas need help
                            The emerging paradigm for humanitarian assistance turns much of the
     and to mobilize        sector’s conventional wisdom upside down. Rather than sit idly waiting for
     resources more         help, victims supply on-the-ground data using cellphones or whatever
                            communications channels are available to them. Rather than simply donate
     quickly.               money, a self-organized network of volunteers triages this data, translating
                            and authenticating text messages and plotting incidents on interactive
              ”             mapping displays that help aid workers target their response. And rather
                            than just forge ahead with narrow institutional priorities, new communication
                            channels like Ushahidi create the potential for the whole emergency relief
                            ecosystem to operate like a coherent entity.

                            Of course, many things could go wrong with this distributed model. People
                            could get the address wrong or exaggerate their situation. But as data
                            accumulates, crisis maps can quickly reveal the emerging patterns of
                            reality in an emergency situation: How many miles inland did the tsunami
                            kill? Which roadways are passable and where are the closest temporary
                            emergency wards? Are the incidents of violence and looting broadly
                            dispersed or concentrated around certain neighborhoods? As Kate Chapman
                            of the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap team put it: “The reality is that in a
                            disaster cycle, everyone has a piece of information, everyone has a piece of
                            that picture. The more that people are able to share information data across
                            ecosystems, and the more information that people have to utilize, then we’ll
                            really see disaster response…be more effective.”

                            Yet, the challenges that crowdmapping presents for humanitarian assistance
                            organizations and networks are real, and much subsequent reflection
                            since the Haitian earthquake has unearthed some important lessons
                            and recommendations. As the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative notes in
                            its Disaster 2.0 report, there are still considerable cultural, procedural and

     assembly is unlikely,      The humanitarian system, for example, has few protocols, procedures, or
                                policies governing the use of information generated by citizens through
     and perhaps                social media, and the voluntary communities are still learning how best to

                                of information management. Among other things, the Harvard Humanitarian
     policy-making              Initiative recommends:

                                The Evolving Promise of Crowdmapping
                                Despite the challenges, the overriding promise of crowdmapping is clear:
                                given an open platform and a complement of simple tools, ordinary people

                                can create effective new information services that are speedier and more
                                resilient than traditional bureaucratic channels. Indeed, what is remarkable is
                                that the Ushahidi-Haiti project might have taken a government agency with
                                loads of money a year or more to execute. Yet, thanks to social innovators
                                like Okolloh and Meier, the crisis mapping community rallied to pull it
                                together in a matter of days with absolutely no cost to the taxpayer.

                                Perhaps most encouraging, however, is that major disaster relief agencies and
                                international organizations—the ones with serious manpower and significant
                                budgets—have begun to incorporate crowdsourcing and crisis mapping

                                tornado response, for example, FEMA (the US-based Federal Emergency
                                Management Agency) harnessed technology and crowdsourcing in all kinds
                                of ways to deliver better results. To get assistance to people impacted by
                                disasters, FEMA used to rely exclusively on reports from ground inspectors.
                                Today they use satellite imagery, crowdsourcing and analytics to determine
                                which areas need help and to mobilize resources more quickly. Mike Hall,
                                FEMA’s federal coordinating officer in New Jersey, described the volunteer
                                efforts to review incoming imagery and speed damage assessments as

                                 where it was needed most. A similar crowdsourcing effort helped federal

                                 bits for others in their organization or network. It is a venerable method, but
                                 it’s also slow and not easily scalable to handling massive increases in data

                                 ﬂows without also increasing the number of humans reading documents. So
                                 Ushhahidi developed SwiftRiver, a suite of intelligence and data gathering

                                 applications that can pull in real-time data from Twitter, SMS, email and RSS
                                 feedsandauto-categorize and classify it using semantic analysis. Such tools
                                 can dramatically reduce the time required to triage information by using

                                 computers rather than people to identify important trends and relationships
                                 that may otherwise appear unrelated.     20


                                 In 2013, the Ushahidi team responded to one of the most fundamental

                                 disaster: the need for reliable connections to the Internet in unpredictable
                                 environments. Spotty wireless connections, intermittent power, or devices

                                 that can’t share connections can all undermine the solutions that Ushahidi
                                 has worked hard to develop. So its engineers branched out into hardware

                                 with BRCK—a so-called “back-up generator for the Internet.” The device—
                                 which resembles a cast iron brick—is physically robust enough to withstand

                                 fieldwork in the most rugged environments. It can connect to multiple
                                 networks, switching seamlessly between Ethernet, Wifi, and 3G or 4G mobile
                                 phone networks as needed. It provides a hub for all local devices, allowing

                                 large teams to share a single connection point. And it stores enough backup
                                 power to survive a blackout, with 8 hours of battery life.    21

                               and Digital Deliberation

                               In a representative democracy, the public participates in governance
                               primarily through voting. Rarely do elected officials seek the
                               expertise of private citizens in making specific decisions about
                               policy. Yet officials in government are not always in possession of all
                               the information necessary to make a decision in the public interest,
                               nor do they always possess the time or the know-how to evaluate
                               the information they have. Crowdsourcing platforms create new
                               opportunities for participation by making it possible to organize
                               the solicitation of know-how and expertise from the public. Indeed,
                               there is increasingly a case to be made that global public policy
                               dialogues should be held internationally, allowing ordinary citizens
                               an opportunity to feed into global decision-making.

                               Consider the trends: Global economic interdependence and
                               transborder issues demanding international responses. Connected
                               citizens, awash in information and empowered to express their
                               voices. Virtual communities linking cultural and ethnic diasporas

                               around the globe. And a broad range of new global institutions
                               and networks created to match the scope of global economic,
                               environmental and security challenges. It only makes sense that
                               some form of democracy should be extended to the international
                               level. While a global parliamentary assembly is unlikely, and perhaps
                               undesirable, crowdsourced policy-making by GSNs and international
                               organizations is a logical first step towards greater inclusion,
                               accountability and legitimacy in global decision-making.

     adjust                     gaming and augmented reality technologies—will enable citizens to track
                                the totality of decision-making processes and see how their contributions

                                Of course, technology alone is not enough; governments, international
                                organizations and GSNs must begin to evolve new participatory practices
                                that exploit the available tools. Present government processes (local,
                                regional, national and international) develop laws and regulations, interpret

                                and define societal norms and deliver societal support services. Their
                                legitimacy is derived through democratic processes combined with
                                a requirement of transparency and accountability. In a world that is
                                increasingly using digital communication and borderless interaction,
                                traditional roles and responsibilities of public administrations will be subject
                                to considerable change and classical boundaries between citizens and their
                                governments are blurring. The balance of power between governments,
                                societal actors and the population will have to adapt to these challenging
                                new possibilities. So too will the governance models, process flows, and
                                analytical tools with which to properly understand, interpret, visualize and
                                harness the forces that could be unleashed by a more participatory and

                                its Minister of Labour and Housing, Joe Fontana, decided to use the global
                                reach of the Internet to help address the world’s most challenging urban

                                issues in a democratic manner. Fontana envisioned a novel democratic

                                issues to the streets on a global scale. In partnership with IBM and the
                               World Urban Forum Secretariat, he conceived an audacious plan to bring

                                thousandsofparticipants from government, business, academia and civil
                                society together for a 72-hour facilitated online discussion where they could
                                strategize around how to provide access to clean water and sanitation, boost

                                environmental sustainability, and improve local governance in the world’s
                                rapidly growing metropolitan regions.


                               The engagement process, a digital brainstorm, was modeled after an event
                                IBM first held in 2001, called an Innovation Jam, where IBM brought together

                                its employees worldwide to explore solutions to global problems. In 2006,
                                the same event was even more successful, bringing together one hundred

                                and fifty thousand employees and dozens of thought leaders online to
                                brainstorm new areas of opportunity for IBM in sectors such as health care,
                                transportation and energy. CEO Sam Palmisano believed so strongly in the

                                concept that he committed up to $100 million to develop the ideas with the
                                most social and economic potential.  24


                               The World Urban Forum Secretariat didn’t have that kind of money to throw
                                at urban sustainability initiatives, but through the courage and support of

                                hundreds of organizations and individuals from around the world, the Habitat
                               Jam broke down the barriers of language, literacy, disability, poverty, war and
                                the digital divide to enable over 39,000 people from 158 countries to begin a
                                                                                    25
                                conversation that some say will change the world.


                               The diversity of the 39,000 was impressive. Slum-dwellers participated
                                alongside government ministers, who participated alongside school children

                                who participated alongside leading academics. The conversation ranged
                                across issues of transportation, clean water, governance, poverty and other
                                issues of importance to people living in cities—especially those who are poor.


                               As perhaps one of the largest public consultation exercises ever attempted,

                                the event proved that it is possible to reach out to thousands to discuss and
                                deliberate about ideas that might be the source of new and more effective
                                policies and services. Indeed, these loosely distributed networks can

                                coalesce to provide focused advice from those most affected by an issue, or
                                those in the best position to take action.


                               According to Fontana, “It was an unbelievable learning experience...This
                                was not a policy conference anymore. It was a gathering of practitioners

                                from civil society and the private sector exploring these questions: What
                                things have worked? What have we learned? What mistakes have we
                                                                       26
                                made? How do we do things better?”        The Habitat Jam was successful in
                                leveraging global networks to bring forward the experience and voices of
                                people who would have never been able to attend the World Urban Forum.

                               Their ‘actionable ideas’ were the starting point for the conference, designed
                                to build networks that would carry their ideas into implementation through
                                improved policies and services—at a global, national, and community level.

                                Apart from these impressive results, there are other less obvious benefits of
                                large-scale online consultations. First and foremost, the broader participation

                                enabled through digital brainstorming leads to better ideas and perhaps a
                                greater diversity of ideas as well. Greater inclusion in the decision-making
                                process, in turn, generates a greater sense of ownership when it comes

                                to implementing the results. The digital brainstorming process facilitates
                               “organizational memory,” leaving a permanent, searchable record of what

                                might otherwise been water cooler conversations and thus provides a
                                foundation for subsequent discussions. It also dispenses with the old model
                                of atomized input and central processing—think “suggestion box”—in

                                favor of a more collaborative model with tools that enable the creation,
                                learning, shaping, sharing and tracking of group knowledge as the process
                                unfolds. In other words, brainstorms are conversations that open up a space

                                for deliberation, analysis and perhaps even compromise among multiple
                                stakeholders. And though existing brainstorming platforms don’t yet offer
                                this, future iterations could include advanced tools that enable citizens to

                                track most decision-making processes and see how their contributions have
                                been (or are being) taken into account.




                                Collaborative Forecasting with the Our Urban Future Project
                                Habitat Jam emphasized a mix of online discussion and face-to-face

                                consultation, and one of its strengths lay in the ability of the network to
                                provide disenfranchised communities with an opportunity to participate
                                in a conversation in which they would otherwise have been marginalized.

                                However, the policy development tools developed since then allow for a
                                much richer dialogue where future scenarios can be visualized and policy
                                options not only discussed, but also evaluated using real data.


                                Imagine a scenario-planning exercise where thousands of connected

                                participants could tap into vast pools of shared data and adjust decision
                                variables on the fly to see how their decisions might impact real people in
                                the future. Stakeholders could forecast, for example, whether investments

                                in primary education for girls will yield better poverty alleviation outcomes
                                than, say, investments in reducing the digital divide. Or, in the efforts to
                                tackle climate change, imagine if scientists, policy-makers, environmentalists,

                                investors and ordinary citizens could access comparable CO emis2ion data
                                for all industrial facilities and other human activities such as logging, fishing

                                or mining. And not only access it, but measure, in precise detail, the impact
                                of those activities on our climate in the same way companies apply financial
                                metrics to their investment decisions to understand the bottom line impact.

                                Such possibilities are no longer as far-fetched as they sound.


                                In 2013, for example, the Evergreen Foundation teamed up with the
                                World Bank, the World Economic Forum, UNEP and hundreds of partners
                                worldwide to create a global policy network called the Our Urban Future

                                of a dynamic forecasting engine built on an open-platform model that

                                permits users to adjust key variables—for example, the rate of urbanization
                                in Southeast Asia, or investments in transportation infrastructure in Central
                                America—in order to examine the impacts of alternative urban investment

                                scenarios on urbanization challenges. Participants will have access to data
                                on historical patterns, trends and planned expenditures in six key sectors,
                                including transportation, energy, water, waste, buildings and technology.

                                The model will permit a number of “straight-line” forecasts over a 50-year
                                time horizon, allowing stakeholder groups and individual citizens to evaluate

                                a broad public outreach program that includes extensive crowdsourcing
                                and civic engagement. Additional face-to-face scenario-planning exercises

                                will be undertaken in Toronto, New York, London, Singapore, Delhi,
                                Nairobi and Shanghai in order to harvest local innovation and catalyze
                                communities around the goal of reimagining (and rebuilding) cities for

                                sustainability. Participants will form into multi-stakeholder teams representing
                                municipalities, industry, non-profits, academia and government. Their job

                                willbetogeneratevisions for the future—visions that are regionally specific,
                                contextual, granular and connected to local conditions. The expectation is
                                that the shared pool of local visions will help surface larger patterns that will

                                be useful in building a global vision for urban infrastructure. And finally, to
                                make all of this real, a network of “change-labs” will be set up where ideas
                                can be piloted locally, further refined and then propagated internationally

                                Digital brainstorms and participatory scenario-planning are great for building
     understanding              networks, forecasting the future and generating proposals for action. Tools
     of science, a nice
                                such as participatory budgeting, on the other hand, are well-suited to enabling

                                affect them directly. Participatory budgeting is a process of democratic
     time when some             deliberation and decision-making in which ordinary people decide how to
     degree of scientific       allocate part of a municipal or public budget. Participatory budgeting allows
                                citizens to identify, discuss, and prioritize public spending projects, and gives
     literacy is required       them the power to make real decisions about how money is spent. The process
     just to understand,        generally involves several basic steps:

     let alone solve,             1. Community members identify spending priorities and select budget
                                    delegates
     some of our
     biggest public               2. Budget delegates develop specific spending proposals, with help
                                    from experts
     policy issues.
                                  3. Community members vote on which proposals to fund, and
                      ”           4. The city or institution implements the top proposals.

                                When participatory budgeting is taken seriously and based on mutual trust,
                                governments and citizens can benefit equally. In some cases participatory
                                budgeting even raises people’s willingness to pay taxes. In fact, citizens
                                have already proven themselves able to make measured, well-reasoned
                                decisions about budgetary issues in cities around the world. The Brazilian
                                city of Belo Horizonte, for example, has been doing participatory budgeting
                                since 1993 and today allocates some $43 million for public works projects
                                that are selected by citizens in nine individualIn Zeguo Township,
                                China, citizens have been convened through statisticallyrandomsampling
                                to establish spending priorities for road, building and construction projects.
                                The German city of Hamburg is perhaps the most technically sophisticated:
                                Itsparticipatorybudgeting exercises conducted in 2006 and 2009 featured

                                an online budget app with sliders that citizens could manipulate up or down
                                to increase or decrease the level of funding for 22 budget items. The site
                                attracted 50,000 visitors who generated over 2,100 draft citizen budgets,
                                with a selection published in30ocal newspapers and used as a basis for
                                discussion in the local parliament.

                                If asking citizens for ideas on how to allocate spending or improve service
                                quality has already proven effective at the local level, there is no reason why
                                such practices could not be extended to the international arena. Citizens in
                                developing nations could have a say on how development financing from the
                                World Bank is spent in their local communities, for example. Or NGOs could
                                use participatory budgeting to allow recipient communities to help prioritize
                                their overseas aid initiatives.

                               The Imperative for Participatory Decision-Making

                               Regardless of the engagement tools deployed, it has become clear that NGOs,
                               governments, companies and international organization can no longer act
                               as isolated decision-making units in a world where complex transboundary

                               issues will overwhelm their capacity to develop meaningful responses in a
                               timely manner. Participating in global solution networks will help equip all
                               stakeholders with the external ideas, skills and resources they will need to
                               coordinate their efforts across jurisdictions and sectors. And the expanding

                               toolkit of engagement tools means that a lack of technology is no longer a
                               valid excuse to exclude relevant stakeholders from the conversation.





                               Citizen Science and Global Problem Solving

                               Another fascinating and powerful addition to the global problem solving
                               toolkit is the growing practice of citizen science, which is essentially scientific

                               researchconducted,in whole or in part, by amateur or nonprofessional
                               scientists. The involvement of citizens in science arguably traces its roots
                               to the discipline of ornithology (the study of birds), where researchers have

                               long benefitted from the work of an international network of birdwatchers
                               who publicly share their findings, (the Audubon Society’s famous “Christmas
                               Bird Count,” for example, was first undertaken in 1900). Over the years,
                               the observations reported by amateur birdwatchers—from backyards to

                               city streets to remote forests—has vastly increased the data available to
                               researchers and helped the ornithology community better understand birds
                               and their habits.


                               With the advent of the Internet, the phenomenon of citizen science has
                               taken off. Today citizen scientists are engaged in just about every discipline.

                               Some are helping to classify galaxies and identifying new planets. Others are
                               using wireless air and water quality sensors to characterize environmental
                               conditions in their neighborhoods. An umbrella organization called the

                               Citizen Science Alliance is currently nurturing a very broad portfolio of
                               citizen science projects in disciplines ranging from data engineering and
                               oceanography to astronomy and archaeology. And in some cases, citizen
                               science projects have spun off powerful new problem-solving networks.

                               the classifications are accurate. According to Kevin Schawinski, one of the

                                       basic guidance, which prompted Schawinski and his colleagues to cook up
                                       a crowdsourcing scheme whereby an army of armchair astronomers would

                                       help them sort through the millions of galactic images they had stored up in
                                       their databases.


                                       As a science project, Galaxy Zoo was tremendously successful. Not only
                                       did the citizen scientists perform 75 million classifications of one million

                                       different images of the universe, the project has resulted in real scientific
                                       discoveries, with several papers already published using the data and

                                       a dozen or so more on the way. The Galaxy Zoo team—which includes
                                       astronomers from Yale and Johns Hopkins University in the United States,
                                       and the University of Oxford and the University of Portsmouth in the United

                                       Kingdom—has often been surprised by the results. Bill Keel, an astronomy
                                       professor at the University of Alabama who studies overlapping galaxies,
                                       decided to ask Galaxy Zoo users to contact him if they came across an

                                       example of this rare phenomenon. Throughout his career, Keel had studied
                                       the dozen or so overlapping galaxies then known to astronomers. Within a
A typical galaxy image for             day of posting his question on the Galaxy Zoo forum, he had more than 100
classification on Galaxy Zoo.
                                       responses from users who had indeed found such objects. Today, thousands
                                       have been identified.


                                       The Galaxy Zoo project has generated other unexpected benefits. The
                                       increasingly tight-knit community’s members range from individuals with

                                       no astronomy background, to schoolteachers and students, to parents
                                       who participate with their children as a sort of family activity. They share
                                       experiences, solve problems together and help educate new members as

                                       they join. Some community members have contributed improveduser
                                       interface solutions, while other Zooites arrange regular meet-ups in places like
                                       New York, London and Amsterdam.


                                       One could argue that citizen science has become a genuine social movement,

                                       complete with a shared sense of identity, shared goals and accomplishments,
                                       and a social fabric that binds them. On top of all that, broad participation in
                                       projects like Galaxy Zoo helps boost the public’s general understanding of

                                       science, a nice side effect at a time when some degree of scientific literacy is
                                       required just to understand, let alone solve, some
                                       of our biggest public policy issues.

                               In one of the most advanced applications in a global problem-solving field,
                               epidemiologists are utilizing citizen science to bolster disease prevention
                               and enhance public health surveillance. Two years ago, a team led by

                               John Brownstein of the Computational Epidemiology Group (CEG) in the
                               Children’s Hospital Informatics Program (CHIP) released an iPhone app called

                               Outbreaks Near Me. In addition to letting users track infectious disease
                               outbreaks on the ground in real time, it enables users to submit an outbreak
                               report. Outbreaks Near Me integrates with HealthMap, a CEG-developed

                               website that displays a unified and comprehensive view of the current
                               global state of infectious diseases based on data from a range of sources,
                               including on-the-ground reports. His team has since launched a second

                               app, MedWatcher, that allows users to get drug safety updates and report
                               information about drug side effects on an international level.


                               More recently, CHIP’s Intelligent Health Laboratory (IHL) partnered with

                               TuDiabetes.org, a health social network focused on diabetes, to launch
                               a data-donation drive encouraging community members to share their
                               hemoglobin A1c status, a health metric used to measure diabetes control

                               over a prolonged period of time. The TuDiabetes community responded
                               enthusiastically: Within three months, 17 percent of active members shared

                               at least one A1c value using TuAnalyze, an application developed by IHL

     local environments,        Society of Exposure Science, attendees are asked to collect samples of

                                Bolstering Science for Global Public Policy
                                Citizen science projects offer a number of advantages to global solution
                                networks, particularly those focused on public policy issues that intersect

                                with cutting-edge science. Citizen scientists have contributed vital data
                                in domains where data is scarce and/or prohibitively expensive to acquire.
                               They have provided the manpower to digitize, analyze and classify data in
                                instances where computer algorithms are inadequate, advancing projects
                                by years and even decades in some cases. They have generated novel
                                discoveries, such as when a Dutch high school teacher identified a novel
                                celestial entity lurking in a random image of the universe. And they contribute
                                to broader scientific literacy and lend a sense of civic purpose to the pursuit
                                of scientific knowledge.


                               At the same time, citizen science initiatives raise a number of challenging
                                issues, including maintaining quality assurance and ensuring unbiased
                                information gathering. Some elements of the scientific community may
                                always doubt the capacity of citizens to engage meaningfully in science
                                without adequate training in scientific methods. Yet, the examples above
                                suggest that appropriately structured citizen engagement in science can
                                bolster scientific progress in global public policy domains and provide novel
                                data to global solution networks that are active on issues ranging from air
                                quality to infectious disease.

                               Judging by the sheer number of crowdsourcing projects popping up, many

                                scientists are keen to increase the involvement of communities and other

                             stakeholders in their research. Galaxy Zoo’s Kevin Schawinski calls citizen
                             science “a powerful multiplier,” and claims it “makes research possible that
                             just wasn’t possible before.A database compiled by Scientific American

                             bolstering Schawinski’s claim.


                             Nor is there any shortage of desire on the part of citizens and communities
                             to participate in scientific research. When the EPA announced that it
                             would make small grants available to communities interested in monitoring
                             pollution in their local environments, the response was so overwhelming that

                             only 7% of applicants could be funded. The implication is that the provision
                             of relatively small resources for citizen sciencebyglobalsolutionnetworks
                             could engage communities and provide enhanced data streams, especially if
                             the results are communicated back to the community.

                             applications are very broad—ranging from citizen science to crowdfunding
                             to digital policymaking to crisis mapping and much more. Indeed, the
                             examples provided above only highlight a fraction of the capabilities that

                             could be unleashed when global solution networks use crowdsourcing to
                             tap into a broader talent pool. What follows is a brief discussion of some of
                             the opportunities and challenges that global solution networks will face in

                             there are some important questions to resolve first. What types of problems,
                             tasks or endeavors are amenable crowdsourcing? How should networks
                             design and structure crowdsourcing initiatives to increase the chances of

                             success? What motives drive people to participate? And, what types of
                             incentives will help increase both the quality and number of participants?


                             Crowdsourcing is ideal for identifying small and highly specialized
                             communities of uniquely qualified minds. Crowdsourced problem solving
                             does not depend on widespread or uniform participation. For example, a
                             global solution network focused on alternative transportation solutions does

Crowdsourcing Solutions to Global Problems

                               cars. It just needs access to few hundred or perhaps a few thousand of
                               the world’s most qualified researchers and innovators. While some issues

                               attract a huge number of people, global solution networks make obscure but
                               important decisions every day that could be better if they used technology
                               to open participation and oversight to a few dozen experts and enthusiasts—

                               the five or ten or hundred people who know the issue best or who are
                               passionate about getting involved in a particular way. Crowdsourcing simply
                               means making it easier for such people to find the areas where they want

                               to work and contribute and giving the public the tools and the process to
                               make participation meaningful and practicable so as to attract high-quality
                               participation and eliminate incompetence.


                               Crowdsourcing is not well-suited to long-term complex problems that are

                               hard to break down into discrete tasks. You can’t, for example, crowdsource
                               the ultimate solution to poverty. But you can crowdsource the funding
                               required to back small community economic development projects on

                               Kiva.org. Or you can crowdsource a better visual interface for displaying
                               the World Bank’s development indicators—just as the World Bank did with
                               is “Apps for Development” contest in 2011. In other words, crowdsourcing

                               works well for bounded problems—i.e., problems that have easily definable
                               parameters and outcomes. If the precise solution you are seeking can’t be
                               articulately and succinctly described, then it probably isn’t a good candidate

                               for crowdsourcing.

                               Crowdsourcing projects are driven by diverse motivations. The answer to

                               what motivates people to participate in crowdsourcing projects (whether
                               citizen science, policymaking or crisis mapping) is ultimately as complex
                               as human nature itself. Some do it for fun or philosophical reasons, and

                               others do it for profit. Some participate to fulfill unmet needs, and still
                               others seek the reputational benefits that can translate into better career
                               prospects. As diverse as they are, the motivations essentially boil down to a

                               mix of intrinsic and extrinsic rewards. Most examples of mass collaboration
                               for the public good are fueled by the personal utility that individuals derive
                               from their participation in the creative process, including intrinsic rewards

                               like the satisfaction of having solved a tough problem or the desire to
                               meet unique needs that the marketplace has not addressed. In fact, the
                               importance of intrinsic rewards is backed up by research. In a survey of

                               nearly 700 open source developers conducted by the Boston Consulting
                               Group, programmers reported that intrinsic rewards such as creativity
                               and autonomy out-weighed extrinsic rewards such as income, career

                               advancement and skills development.


                               Crowdsourcing requires incentives—even for public good projects. Relying
                               on altruism by itself it not necessarily sufficient to motivate contributions to
                               the public good. Global solution networks that pursue crowdsourcing still

                               need to pay careful attention to the explicit and implicit incentive systems
                               they put in place. In most innovation or app development contests, for
                               example, only the winner receives recognition or compensation, which means

                               many participants who devote time and intellectual effort to contributing
                               ideas may get little reward for their hard work. Finding ways to recognize

                              York Times thanking the thousands of individuals that have contributed to

                              the Firefox development over the years. Mozilla also holds regular contributor
                              appreciation days in cities around the world and maintains a running list of all
                              contributors on its website.





                              Implications for Policy Networks

                              Engaging regular people and experts using crowdsourcing seems a

                              straightforward way to both promote democratic engagement in global
                              solution networks and draw in expertise and new ideas to public policy.
                              But there are some unique challenges in applying crowdsourcing to policy

                              development. On one hand, the evidence suggests that creating an open,
                              nonhierarchical space for ideas focused on change taps incredible energy.
                              But it also creates a major commitment to action when thousands of involved

                              minds come together to set an agenda. While some stakeholders may
                              embrace this new culture of deliberation, other may express reticence. For
                              example, governments tend to emphasize hierarchy, debate behind closed

                              doors, and a culture that is often skeptical of new ideas. Global problem
                              solvers must work to reconcile these diverse organizational cultures in order
                              to fully realize the potential for crowdsourcing to add ingenuity, legitimacy
                              and momentum to the work of public policy. The following are some key

                              implications for policymakers and other participants in policy networks.


                              Crowdsourcing policy is not about gathering opinions—it’s about
                              assembling insight and capability. When it comes to crowdsourced
                              policymaking and digital engagement, the idea is not merely for
                              governments, international organizations or GSNs to understand what

                              citizens think should happen; public opinion polls can do that. But what
                              polls don’t capture is the wisdom and insight that a nation can collectively
                              offer through online brainstorming and discussion. Social networks and

                              technologies are making the process of engaging citizens in: easier
                              and less costly than ever. As some of the earlier examples illustrate, the
                              possibilities are wide-ranging. International gatherings and forums can post

                              background information on the Web and use online video conferencing to
                              bring in expert testimony. Web-enabled forums can enable discussion and
                              debate amongst hundreds, thousands, and even millions of geographically-

                              dispersed participants. Wikis provide a platform for collaborative editing
                              of policy documents, while social networking technologies can connect
                              citizens and organizations with common goals and interests. The promise is
                              that digital engagement technologies will support global decision-making

                              processes and GSNs that integrate citizen engagement, policy development
                              and implementation into a seamless and flexible practice of continuous
                              engagement, improvement and innovation.

                                Crowdsourced policymaking needn’t place undue strain on public
                                officials or GSN leaders. With a collaborative process, some of the burden
                                of collecting, sorting, analyzing and drafting shifts to the public, leaving

                                public officials in a position to steer and referee the process. An opportunity
                                space opens up for deliberation, reflection and perhaps even compromise
                                among multiple stakeholders. Here’s how New York University professor

                                and GovLab founder Beth Noveck puts it: “In a collaborative government,
                                public participation is not pro forma. Though the recommendations made
                                by private citizens are not binding, they are taken as serious contributions

                                to the decision-making process. At the same time, collaboration assumes
                                that stakeholders are qualified to make useful contributions to the subject-
                                or industry-specific work of the agency. As such, a government agency

                                that solicits public feedback employs a system to evaluate the input of the
                                self-selecting private citizen. Only it is not the government agency that
                                initially evaluates public feedback. Initially, ratings and recommendations

                                remain in the hands of private citizens. Their recommendations are vetted
                                by groups ancillary to the government agency. These groups comprise the
                                very individuals who have volunteered their expertise in the first place. This

                                alleviates some of the burden that participation outside of organizational
                                boundaries creates for government officials.”


                                Inclusive processes are key to fostering legitimacy. Finding ways to foster
                                genuine inclusiveness—regardless of social, cultural, religious or economic

                                barriers—is one of the key challenges for multi-stakeholder dialogues and
                                policy networks. For example, Habitat Jam was designed to provide a voice
                                to those who were living in the conditions up for discussion at the World

                                Urban Forum. Many of them—especially rural villagers and slum dwellers—
                                have little to no access to the Internet, except through rudimentary mobile
                                phones that don’t support advanced applications. The digital divide was

                                thus a very real barrier to inclusiveness, and threatened the legitimacy of
                                the project. To solve the problem, more than 400 civil society organizations
                                were enlisted to connect with the communities that deserved to be heard.

                                Internet kiosks were set up in slums and villages, where people could come
                                to have their suggestions transcribed onto the Jam website. Public meetings
                                were held to discuss the issues. CyberCafes became hubs for community

                                input into the process. One deaf man in Kenya even brought his own
                                translator to ensure that his ideas could connect with global leaders.


                                Governments and GSN leaders must be prepared to cede some control.
                                Manypoliticians and international bureaucrats would genuinely like to

                                reduce the democratic deficit at the international level and strengthen
                                representative processes. The reality is that getting to genuine citizen
                                engagement is hard—it entails a truly massive shift in the culture of

                                international organizations and networks and the apparatus of decision-
                                making. Giles Gherson, senior civil servant for the Government of Ontario
                                speaks for all level of government, from local to global, when he says, “If we’re

                                going to be getting into the wiki world and engaging citizens and having real
                                authentic conversations with them, then it’s probably going to have to be a
                                very different culture. We’re going to have to cede a lot of control over that

                               development, from problem definition, to analysis, to identifying strategic
                               options and making decisions.


                               Principles of representation and accountability must be extended to the
                               global level. International digital brainstorms like Habitat Jam have the

                               potential to trigger and shape significant changes in the way future societies
                               will function. They signal the degree to which we are moving into an era
                               in which the power and authority of international organizations, and the

                               legitimacy of global decision-making, will become ever more dependent
                               upon interactive democracy. But, leaders of international policy networks
                               and GSNs must ensure that digitally enabled citizen engagement does

                               not merely amplify the voices of organized interest groups that are already
                               heard in policy-making. Some of the challenges for policy networks
                               include: addressing social and political divides, ensuring there is an explicit

                               relationship between citizen input and policy outcomes, and providing
                               trusted public space where participants of all political persuasions will
                               engage in policy deliberation. Most important, policy networks are an

                               antidote to simplistic surveys that pose either/or or limited multiple-choice
                               questions. More substantive deliberative models such as citizen juries, online
                               consultations, deliberative polling and virtual question periods are leading

                               options for broadening participation.

                               11 Interview with Patrick Meier.

                               12 Groups such as Medecins Sans Frontiers, for example, complained that

                                  the US Army prioritized getting military personnel and equipment into
                                  the country over humanitarian supplies. One aid worker quoted by the
                                  BBC claimed logistical disagreements between the US Army and the UN

                                  were causing a “situation of utter chaos.” Of course, it has not helped
                                  that infrastructures for transport and communications were severely
                                  damaged or that the Haitian government was ill-equipped for such a

                                  crisis. But it appears that much of the blame for the lack of coordination
                                   lies with the relief agencies themselves. See: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/

                               13 For example, the report found that efforts to rebuild communities were

                                  more successful when those affected by the tsunami were involved in
                                  planning the reconstruction efforts. “The only way to redeem that kind
                                  of loss is to empower and dignify those people who have suffered,”
