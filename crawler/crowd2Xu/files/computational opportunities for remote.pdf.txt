A           Abstract
h
o               In this paper, we state our aims and aspirations for building a global network of likeminded people
M               interested in developing and encouraging students in the field of computational biophysics (CB).
a               Global capacity building efforts have uncovered local computational talent in virtually every
u               community regardless of where the students reside. Our vision is to discover and encourage these
c               aspiring investigators by suggesting ways that they and other “garage scientists” can participate in
p               new science even if they have no access to sophisticated research infrastructure. We argue that
t               participatory computing in the “cloud” is particularly suitable for CB and available to any budding
                computational biophysicist if he or she is provided with open-minded mentors who have the
                necessary skills and generosity. We recognize that there are barriers to the development of such
                remote collaborations, and we discuss possible pathways to overcome these barriers. We point out
                that this Special Issue of Biophysical Reviews provides a much-needed forum for the development
                of several specific applications of CB.

H                        We note that CB, just like its parent discipline biophysics, is inherently an interdisciplinary
-                        science with multiple branches spanning all levels of biological organization. We define CB
A                        broadly as the study of biologically significant problems using a range of quantitative
A                        methods from small to large scales, such as ab initio analysis of molecular structure,
u
h                        molecular dynamics and mechanics, molecular modeling, molecular graphics, and even data
r                        mining. These computational techniques can be applied to a range of macromolecules and
M                        macromolecular systems as well as to cells, entire organisms, and their populations.
n
u                        CB as a term is not widely established, but CB techniques have been used extensively in the
c                        literature (e.g., Craddock et al. 2012; Anisimov and Cavasotto 2011; Qin et al. 2009; Phillips
p                        et al. 2005, to mention just a few). There are even graduate courses specifically devoted to
t                        CB. A CB course outline (MIT BioEECS 2012) at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
                         states: “No single approach fully characterizes the research that falls into this area as the
                         methods we employ are often problem dependent. Nevertheless, in many cases numerical
                         techniques provide a platform that is used to gain insights into difficult biological
                         problems.” There have also been meetings specifically devoted to CB (Sagot et al. 2009),
                         and there are NIH-funded training programs that provide educational certificates issued in
                         the field of structural and computational biophysics (Poole 2011).

             Background and mission

                         Global communication technology and remote computational services promise to eliminate
                         geographic barriers through participatory information sharing. These “Web 2.0” and “cloud
                         computing” techniques enable unconventional scientific collaborations which no longer
                         require a physical laboratory. At the same time, there is a desire by many independently
I                        supported “citizen scientists” (and traditional graduate students without ready access to a
H                        university-level research infrastructure) to participate in bona fide scientific discovery. This
P                        fledging movement was termed “garage science” in a recent series of articles in the journal
A
u                        Nature (Ledford 2010).
h                        Garage science, citizen science, crowd sourcing, and similar fashionable terms are used to

M                        describe volunteer work that has been accepted practice in many fields for more than a
a                        century (Cook 2011). For example, amateur astronomers have long participated in scientific
u                        studies led by professional astrophysicists (Astronomical Society of the Pacific 2012). The
c                        new power of the internet can be exemplified by the success of crowd-sourcing projects
p                        such as Wikipedia, and the fact that the “garage” movement has now reached the biological
t                        sciences (Khatib et al. 2011).

                         biophysics. It is likely there is a large and untapped target group of scholars who may be

u
h                        ultimately fruitful (see Open questions below), we feel that the time is right for large
r                        organizations to take action. The International Union for Pure and Applied Biophysics
M                        (IUPAB) is a major force behind this Special Issue of Biophysical Reviews devoted to CB.
n                        There is a realistic opportunity for IUPAB and the family of International Scientific Unions
u                        (ICSU) to contribute to the development of a global student–mentor network that can be a
c                        great benefit to the global scientific community. The students in these networks would be
p                        talented, quantitative scholars of all ages and from any country, who wish to add research
t                        expertise and credentials to their resume, and who want to know how they can participate in
                         biophysical research. The role of the mentors would be to find an accessible way to expand
                         their personnel base with remote students and research partners. Depending on the project, it
                         may not be necessary that the mentors bring significant hardware resources to the table, so
                         our focus here is on human interactions rather than technical questions or development of a
                         distributed computing grid.

I                        The main mission of this contribution is to explore the use of CB as a global participatory

u                        interactions between these students and appropriate mentors, who produce, in turn, new

u                        The marketing (or branding) of CB will be critical if we wish to attract both students and
c                        mentors. Due to its interdisciplinary nature, CB can be characterized as a life-style choice
p                        that emerges from a general scientific vocation in the hard mathematical and scientific
t                        disciplines. Initial attraction to CB is often less motivated by direct biological or medical
                         questions than by an interest in computation and mathematical or theoretical questions.
                         Consequently, there are some possible advantages and limitations of CB that may affect the
                         motivation and satisfaction of the collaborating researchers.

             Pros

I                            •   CB is at the interface of many disciplines (computer science, statistics, applied
H                                math, biology, physics, and chemistry). It is very rewarding from a learning
P                                perspective since it touches upon a wide range of intellectually stimulating
A                                concepts.
u
h                            •   It is great fun to work on a computer (satisfaction of creative work, building tools,
r                                software, and problem solving).
M                            •   A computational career is less risky than an experimental career; for example, CB
a                                skills are readily transferrable to other disciplines.
u
c                            •   There are opportunities to engage in global interactions and travel.
p
t            Cons

                             •   There are more lucrative applications of computer technology, at Silicon Valley
                                 companies and in finance, for example. Then again, most scientists prefer

                                 satisfaction over personal wealth, and it is fun to learn about and contribute to
                                 science. Ultimately, volunteering time for science is a personal decision.
N
H                            •   In the biological sciences, purely dry modeling and simulation only rarely lead to
-                                significant discoveries. Frequently, CB researchers engage in collaborations with
A                                experimentalists by solving software engineering projects or by assisting
A                                experimental scientists in the interpretation of their data (Application examples).
u                                The high regard placed in biophysics on wet laboratory data collection can be a
h                                humbling experience for researchers from quantitative disciplines who are
r                                accustomed to a historically more dominant role of theory and computation.
M
n                            •   The quantitatively most inspiring research areas in CB are often well populated by
u                                theorists attracted to them, and they are consequently very competitive in terms of
c                                funding or positions. The market eventually forces many CB researchers to find
p                                their niche outside the original gamut of research interests.
t
                          The challenges facing CB are not uncommon in science and affect mainly those researchers
                          with academic career aspirations, but they do not weigh in heavily if the project is primarily
                          seen as an educational experience. In Open questions, we propose additional motivating
                          factors for students and mentors that may make the experience worthwhile.

-                         The proposed remote collaborations should not necessarily require specific high-
A                         performance computing hardware. We wish to empower outstanding graduate students and
A                         researchers based on personal abilities and interests, regardless of their geographic location
u                         and the specific infrastructure available to them. In the following, we describe two fields of
h                         CB where, in the absence of expensive laboratories with high-end infrastructure, skilled

t                                is described by Starosolski et al. (2012) in this issue. The paper describes specific
                                 Web 2.0 services employed by that group in the development of the Sculptor 3D
                                 modeling and visualization software illustrated in Fig. 1. The collaboration

                                 involves a core group of four contributors who regularly volunteer their free time.
                                 Due to the absence of organizational overhead, the operation of such a virtual
                                 laboratory can be very efficient (Rusu and Wriggers 2012; Rusu et al. 2012). The
I                                glue that holds the team together in this case is the mutual desire to continue with
H                                work that was incubated in a traditional laboratory. However, we believe that one
P                                can foster a similar sense of community among any researchers who share a
A                                common goal (see Regularly scheduled retreats or conferences). For example, the

H                               databases are not nearly as well developed as gene databases, but they are arguably

A                               more important. Perhaps only about half the altered genes result in corresponding
A                               changes at the protein level. Insertions, deletions, splicing variants, and other
u                               mechanisms result in many more proteins than the available 20,000 or so genes in
h                               man. Proteomics databases are similar to their gene “cousins” in that they produce
r                               the raw data, assembled data, and metadata. The raw data files are often obtained
M                               by mass spectrometry and, although they can be reanalyzed, it remains to be seen
n                               whether repositories of these data (Tranche Developers Group 2012) are viable
u                               (Poole 2011). At the next two levels, data are assembled by researchers into
c                               peptides and proteins (equivalent to nucleotide sequences) and developed into
p                               metadata. The proteomics equivalent of GEO is likely to move or take different
t                               forms, depending on future funding opportunities. In the meantime, there are ample
                                data on intact known proteins, which can be freely downloaded through ExPASy
                                (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics 2012).

             Effective capacity building

                         There are divergent aims and strategies for training the next generation of scientists. One
I                        must balance altruism [e.g., trying to help members of disadvantaged minority groups
-                        (MentorNet 2012) or students in the developing world] with the interest of mentors to be
A                        efficient with their time and to excel in their research; mentors are held accountable by their
A                        peers and need to be efficient with their mentorship investment.
u
h                        Due to this tradeoff, we anticipate a need for a selection mechanism for admitting students
r                        to a remote mentorship program. A uniform set of standards should be applied in the
M                        selection. Those accepted into the program should have an understanding of calculus and
n
u                        matrix algebra, proficiency in at least one computer language, and a general knowledge of
c                        chemistry and physics. Thus, students in different countries might have completed different
p                        levels of schooling to reach this starting point. The application and selection process should
t                        follow standard professional practices, e.g., submission of official transcripts, personal
                         statements, confidential letters of recommendation on behalf of the student, and involvement
                         of mentors in the choice of students. We also realize that it is not possible to help everyone,
                         so it may be better to choose a select few whom our mentors consider to have innate
                         mathematical talent. The mentors will leave the program if their needs are ignored. Also,
                         one does not do students a favor by providing encouragement that is not matched to their
                         capabilities.
I
H                        We realize that the late exposure of secondary education students to mathematics and
P                        physics in many countries suggests that a college level education might be necessary for the
A                        proposed program. On the other hand, the recent introduction of young African students to
u                        biophysics through a workshop experience in Latin America (Open questions) is tangible
h                        proof that our aims can be met.
r
M
a            Regularly scheduled retreats or conferences
u                        All mentors and students should be invited to regular retreats or conferences to foster a sense
c                        of community. These could be attached to IUPAB-sponsored meetings and workshops,
p
t                        rather than waiting for the triennial IUPAB Congresses. Costs could be reduced by holding
                         these events in less expensive venues around the world, but the safety of participants and the
                         trustworthiness of local infrastructure must be a concern. The areas where potential mentors

-             Funding sources
A                         We have identified a number of possible funding strategies that could be explored in more
A                         detail:
u
h                             •  IUPAB regularly provides seed funding for educational, often very successful
r                                workshops that are co-funded in non-mainstream cities. ICSU may also be able to
M                                help in this regard.
n
u                             •  The US National Science Foundation has specific programs for fostering science
c                                exchange in a limited number of countries, although no CB programs have yet been
p                                envisioned.
t                             •  The US Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) has a wide variety of past and

                                 present international/educational initiatives, although none of the type proposed
                                 here. A program involving funded HHMI investigators as mentors might be
                                 attractive.
                              •  The Human Frontiers Science Program (HFSP) currently offers no specific funding
                                 mechanism, but our goals match well with their international mission for
I                                collaborative research grants. Perhaps a new opportunity can be created here, or
-
A                                HFSP investigators could use their funds for a mentorship program.
A                             •  Other foundations: the Agouron Institute (San Diego) and Burroughs-Wellcome
u                                (Research Triangle) support young US-based investigators working at the
h                                interfaces of biology and the physical/mathematical sciences. The Keck Foundation
r                                (California) limits funds to US institutions.
M
n                             •  Philanthropy: If asked, wealthy individuals with a science affinity might offer
u                                financial assistance. This approach probably would need to establish a 501(c)(3)
c                                non-profit in the US to establish tax-advantages for donors.
p
t                             •  Corporations: Companies in the US are willing to give to social causes as part of
                                 their corporate social responsibility programs. This requires 501 (c)(3) non-profit
                                 status. See MentorNet (2012) for a mentorship-based non-profit organization that
                                 caters to corporate donations.

                              •  International humanitarian organizations such as the United Nations (UNDP or
                                 UNICEF capacity building programs) or the US Peace Corps may fund human
I                                empowerment efforts. Perhaps even religious institutions may be interested (e.g.,
H                                the Vatican, which has a significant scientific program).
P                             •  It is important to note that any of the above funding opportunities may have
A
u                                restrictions and expectations that need to be taken into consideration.
h             Open questions
r
M                         We are just starting to explore the opportunities of remote collaborations and much more
a                         work needs to be done. Some questions that remain open include:
u
c                             •  Computer hardware. It is unlikely that any remote scholars would bring significant
p                                computational resources to the table. There may be security risks involved in giving
t                                strangers access to local computer resources (almost certainly university policies
                                 would prohibit carte blanche access, although they may allow access via resident
                                 mentors). Computing in the cloud (see Amazon EC2 server; Amazon Web Services
                                 2012) has recently emerged as a viable alternative to a local computing

                                 infrastructure, but regional access models and leasing costs still favor participants
                                 from the developing world. Perhaps the best starting strategy would be to provide
N                                students with laptops sponsored by the mentors or by donors. The projects in
H                                Application examples are relatively lean on hardware needs and suitable for laptop-
-
A                                based collaborations. If the need arises, mentors are of course free to provide
A                                additional access to their own Linux clusters and high-performance computing
u                                resources (provided that they can find a secure way to operate accounts), or, as
h                                more research laboratories gain sufficient expertise, to lease computer resources in
r                                the cloud.
M                             •  Benefits to students. In addition to the education afforded by the outreach aspects
n
u                                of the program, there are specific benefits that may aid students (and other
c                                participants) in their future career development. In general, students who enter
p                                mentor programs have a lower drop-out rate in their local schools, report that they
t                                feel more confident, and express greater satisfaction with their education
                                 (MentorNet 2012). Also, letters of recommendation and petitions from established
                                 mentor-professors can help students meet their graduation requirements and
                                 frequently open the door to subsequent job opportunities. IUPAB cannot grant
                                 degrees, but it might enhance degree-granting programs by partnering local
                                 academic mentors with research mentors from other institutions. In South America,
                                 the Latin American Federation of Biophysical Societies (LAFeBS) found a way for
I                                students to achieve access to advanced facilities not available locally without the
-                                loss of continuous enrollment status at their home institution. For more details,
A                                students and mentors should contact Professor Marcelo Morales, the president of

h                             •  Benefits to mentors. We assume that the student–mentor relationship would be the
r                                main driver of the scientific interactions, provided that the relationship is mutually
M                                beneficial. To make the investment of mentorship worthwhile to mentors, the
n                                participants of the program are expected to contribute to scientific work in the
u                                remote laboratories. The program thus has to walk a thin line between serving the
c                                motives of the students and those of the mentors. In terms of labor rights, the most
p
t                                often voiced criticism about Web 2.0 services and crowd sourcing is that expert
                                 knowledge is exerted by participants for relatively little reward from the entities
                                 they serve (Brabham 2012). In the scientific realm, this risk of exploitation is
                                 mitigated by the absence of a monetary profit motive. Also, mentors are expected
                                 to take a risk and invest most of their time in the relationship initially. There should
                                 be a contract and arbitration policies to help both sides meet their expectations.
                                 Also, many scientists (including the authors) believe it is appropriate for scientists
I                                to give something back to the scientific community, so our proposal can provide a
H                                conduit for such philanthropy.
P
A                             •  Unintended consequences. We acknowledge that, without appropriate employment
u                                opportunities, there may be no future for many scientists in their existing
h                                environment. The success of our proposed program could thus contribute to the
r                                “brain drain” problem faced by so many countries. This unintended outcome needs
M                                to be researched further. We need to understand what is stopping top talent from
a                                leaving. The increased outsourcing of technical jobs to places where employment
u                                costs are low, in combination with continuing improvements in person-to-person
c                                communication, suggests that there may be employment opportunities in the future

t                                world. Also, CB can provide an opportunity to allow overseas-trained

                                 computational biophysicists to return to their native country where they may
                                 become second-generation mentors. We need more information about the current

N                                Latin America for a workshop on biophysics where they rubbed shoulders with

A                                to Latin America, and they include budding CB scientists. Clearly, this was just the
