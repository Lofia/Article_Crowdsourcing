    Abstract

    Background: An Escherichia coli O104:H4 outbreak in Germany in summer 2011 caused 53 deaths, over 4000 individual
    infections across Europe, and considerable economic, social and political impact. This outbreak was the first in a position to

    exploit rapid, benchtop high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies and crowdsourced data analysis early in its
    investigation, establishing a new paradigm for rapid response to disease threats. We describe a novel strategy for design of
    diagnostic PCR primers that exploited this rapid draft bacterial genome sequencing to distinguish between E. coli O104:H4
    outbreak isolates and other pathogenic E. coli isolates, including the historical hæmolytic uræmic syndrome (HUSEC) E. coli

    HUSEC041 O104:H4 strain, which possesses the same serotype as the outbreak isolates.

    Methodology/Principal Findings: Primers were designed using a novel alignment-free strategy against eleven draft whole
    genome assemblies of E. coli O104:H4 German outbreak isolates from the E. coli O104:H4 Genome Analysis Crowd-Sourcing

    Consortium website, and a negative sequence set containing 69 E. coli chromosome and plasmid sequences from public
    databases. Validation in vitro against 21 ‘positive’ E. coli O104:H4 outbreak and 32 ‘negative’ non-outbreak EHEC isolates
    indicated that individual primer sets exhibited 100% sensitivity for outbreak isolates, with false positive rates of between 9%
    and 22%. A minimal combination of two primers discriminated between outbreak and non-outbreak E. coli isolates with

    100% sensitivity and 100% specificity.

    Conclusions/Significance: Draft genomes of isolates of disease outbreak bacteria enable high throughput primer design
    and enhanced diagnostic performance in comparison to traditional molecular assays. Future outbreak investigations will be

    able to harness HTS rapidly to generate draft genome sequences and diagnostic primer sets, greatly facilitating
    epidemiology and clinical diagnostics. We expect that high throughput primer design strategies will enable faster, more
    precise responses to future disease outbreaks of bacterial origin, and help to mitigate their societal impact.
