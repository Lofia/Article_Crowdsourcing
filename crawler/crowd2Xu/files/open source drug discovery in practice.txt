    Abstract


    Background: Open source drug discovery offers potential for developing new and inexpensive drugs to combat diseases
    that disproportionally affect the poor. The concept borrows two principle aspects from open source computing (i.e.,
    collaboration and open access) and applies them to pharmaceutical innovation. By opening a project to external

    contributors, its research capacity may increase significantly. To date there are only a handful of open source R&D projects
    focusing on neglected diseases. We wanted to learn from these first movers, their successes and failures, in order to
    generate a better understanding of how a much-discussed theoretical concept works in practice and may be implemented.


    Methodology/Principal Findings: A descriptive case study was performed, evaluating two specific R&D projects focused on
    neglected diseases. CSIR Team India Consortium’s Open Source Drug Discovery project (CSIR OSDD) and The Synaptic
    Leap’s Schistosomiasis project (TSLS). Data were gathered from four sources: interviews of participating members (n=14), a
    survey of potential members (n=61), an analysis of the websites and a literature review. Both cases have made significant

    achievements; however, they have done so in very different ways. CSIR OSDD encourages international collaboration, but its
    process facilitates contributions from mostly Indian researchers and students. Its processes are formal with each task being
    reviewed by a mentor (almost always offline) before a result is made public. TSLS, on the other hand, has attracted
    contributors internationally, albeit significantly fewer than CSIR OSDD. Both have obtained funding used to pay for access to

    facilities, physical resources and, at times, labor costs. TSLS releases its results into the public domain, whereas CSIR OSDD
    asserts ownership over its results.

    Conclusions/Significance: Technically TSLS is an open source project, whereas CSIR OSDD is a crowdsourced project.

    However, both have enabled high quality research at low cost. The critical success factors appear to be clearly defined entry
    points, transparency and funding to cover core material costs.
