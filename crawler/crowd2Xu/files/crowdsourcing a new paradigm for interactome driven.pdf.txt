    Abstract

    A decade since the availability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) genome sequence, no promising drug has seen the light
    of the day. This not only indicates the challenges in discovering new drugs but also suggests a gap in our current

    understanding of Mtb biology. We attempt to bridge this gap by carrying out extensive re-annotation and constructing a
    systems level protein interaction map of Mtb with an objective of finding novel drug target candidates. Towards this, we

    synergized crowd sourcing and social networking methods through an initiative ‘Connect to Decode’ (C2D) to generate the
    first and largest manually curated interactome of Mtb termed ‘interactome pathway’ (IPW), encompassing a total of 1434
    proteins connected through 2575 functional relationships. Interactions leading to gene regulation, signal transduction,

    metabolism, structural complex formation have been catalogued. In the process, we have functionally annotated 87% of the
    Mtb genome in context of gene products. We further combine IPW with STRING based network to report central proteins,
    which may be assessed as potential drug targets for development of drugs with least possible side effects. The fact that five

    of the 17 predicted drug targets are already experimentally validated either genetically or biochemically lends credence to
    our unique approach.

Figure 5. Illustration of 17 putative drug target interaction from IPW interactome depicting the cascade of how the central proteins
interact with each other in a spatio-temporal manner under different conditions like growth, stress and survival in macrophages
including virulence. Under normal conditions, PknB phosphorylates RshA which inhibits SigH. However, under oxidative stress, RshA is not
phosphorylated and this abolishes its binding to SigH, rendering it free. SigH in turn upregulates expression of SigE and SigB which regulates MprA
(bacterial persistence regulator). MprA also regulates SigB and SigE. SigB plays important role in adaptation to stationary phase and nutritionally poor
conditions and SigE is upregulated in mycobacterial growth within human macrophages and is transcribed from three different promoters under

different conditions. sigB is also regulated by SigF, which regulates the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis and structure of the
mycobacterial cell envelope, including complex polysaccharides and lipids, particularly virulence- related sulfolipids and several transcription factors.
Rv0516c is an anti-anti sigma factor and regulates anti-sigma factor SigF (upregulated during infection culture of human macrophages and in
nutrient starvation condition; regulates transcription of genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis, sulfolipid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, energy
metabolism and several transcription factors) on getting phosphorylated by PknD which in turn is regulated by Rv0020c phosphorylated by PknB and
PknE. SigF also regulates sigC and regulates hspx that is also regulated by dosR regulon. dosR regulon in turn is again regulated by PhoP which is a
transcription factor for nuoG, eccCb1, esxb/cfp10 [48].
