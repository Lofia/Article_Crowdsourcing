Could digital patient communities be the launch


pad for patient-centric trial design?

Paul Wicks



  Abstract

  The system of medical discovery does not revolve around patients as unique individuals with preferences, needs,
  and desires. Rather it revolves around scientific scrutiny, the needs of the sponsor, and the desires for regulatory

  approval. The patient is only a subject. Is it any wonder, then, that some patients have rejected the current medical
  paradigm and sought to find their own path?
