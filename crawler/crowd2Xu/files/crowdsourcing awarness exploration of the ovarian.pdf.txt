    Abstract

    Background: Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic disease in the United States, with more women dying from this
    cancer than all gynecological cancers combined. Ovarian cancer has been termed the ‘‘silent killer’’ because some patients

    do not show clear symptoms at an early stage. Currently, there is a lack of approved and effective early diagnostic tools for
    ovarian cancer. There is also an apparent severe knowledge gap of ovarian cancer in general and of its indicative symptoms
    among both public and many health professionals. These factors have significantly contributed to the late stage diagnosis
    of most ovarian cancer patients (63% are diagnosed at Stage III or above), where the 5-year survival rate is less than 30%.

    The paucity of knowledge concerning ovarian cancer in the United States is unknown.

    Methods: The present investigation examined current public awareness and knowledge about ovarian cancer. The study
    implemented design strategies to develop an unbiased survey with quality control measures, including the modern

    application of multiple statistical analyses. The survey assessed a reasonable proxy of the US population by crowdsourcing
    participants through the online task marketplace Amazon Mechanical Turk, at a highly condensed rate of cost and time
    compared to traditional recruitment methods.


    Conclusion: Knowledge of ovarian cancer was compared to that of breast cancer using repeated measures, bias control and
    other quality control measures in the survey design. Analyses included multinomial logistic regression and categorical data
    analysis procedures such as correspondence analysis, among other statistics. We confirmed the relatively poor public
    knowledge of ovarian cancer among the US population. The simple, yet novel design should set an example for designing

    surveys to obtain quality data via Amazon Mechanical Turk with the associated analyses.

knew of breast cancer or ovarian cancer ‘‘Not at All,’’ ‘‘Fairly Well,’’ or ‘‘Very Well,’’ respectively. Male participants presented a strong indication of
breast cancer knowledge, as evidenced by the ‘‘Fairly Well’’ and ‘‘Very Well’’ categories. Conversely, male participants had virtually no knowledgeof

ovarian cancer. A majority of female participants also responded that they knew of ovarian cancer ‘‘Not at All,’’however most of the female
participants knew of ovarian and breast cancer ‘‘Fairly Well.’’ Both men and women did not know of breast cancer of ovarian cancer ‘‘Very Well.’’

Figure 4. Correspondence Analysis of Risk. Correspondence is determined by distance away from horizontal and vertical axis. The cloud of raw
data points in the middle of the graph have no relationship to one another and therefore are close to the horizontal and vertical midpoints of the
graph. The points are further away from the vertical midpoint but close on the horizontal axis, which indicates a good relationship between the

predictor variables. However, the points far away from the vertical midpoint and far away from the horizontal midpoint indicates a poor relationship.
Therefore participants’ selections for lifetime breast cancer risk were consistent in their initial and repeated survey responses. Responses for ovarian
cancer lifetime risk varied widely, indicating that the participants were guessing their response selections.
