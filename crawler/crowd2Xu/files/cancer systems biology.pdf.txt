             Abstract

                 Traditionally, scientific research has focused on studying individual events, such as single
N                mutations, gene function or the effect of the manipulation of one protein on a biological
H                phenotype. A range of technologies, combined with the ability to develop robust and predictive
-                mathematical models, is beginning to provide information that will enable a holistic view of how
A
A                the genomic and epigenetic aberrations in cancer cells can alter the homeostasis of signalling
u                networks within these cells, between cancer cells and the local microenvironment, at the organ and
o                organism level. This systems biology process needs to be integrated with an iterative approach
r                wherein hypotheses and predictions that arise from modelling are refined and constrained by
M
n                experimental evaluation. Systems biology approaches will be vital for developing and
s                implementing effective strategies to deliver personalized cancer therapy. Specifically, these
r                approaches will be important to select those patients most likely to benefit from targeted therapies
p                as well as for the development and implementation of rational combinatorial therapies. Systems
t                biology can help to increase therapy efficacy or bypass the emergence of resistance, thus

                 converting the current (often short term) effects of targeted therapies into durable responses,
                 ultimately to improve quality of life and provide a cure.


N                        To ensure the survival of the organism, millions of signals are sent and received every
H                        second between cells, tissues, or organs and the external environment, and they are
P                        integrated into responses at multiple levels and scales in the body. Robust homeostatic
A                        mechanisms must be in place to fine-tune responses and, in particular, allow the organism to
A
t                        deal with potentially toxic environmental perturbations, such as those derived from
o                        pathogens, food, air (tobacco smoke, diesel fumes), or drugs. These mechanisms must also
r                        be resistant to the effects of spontaneous somatic mutations and the many germline
a                        mutations that ultimately alter the biological function of proteins.

                          in order to build robust predictive models. Indeed, one of the key precepts of systems
                          biology is that the complexity of the cell and its environment can be “modeled” and that
                          these models can be both robust and predictive. It allows an unbiased analysis of the data

                          owing to their ability to specifically target one process, the response rates have not as yet

N                         network analyses has the potential to support the understanding of the relationship between
H                         molecular markers and response to (targeted) therapies, facilitating the identification of the

M                         tumours is an exciting opportunity to elucidate mechanisms underlying resistance and to

                          of the tumour, and thus represent potential targets or biomarkers, from ‘passenger’
                                                                                          20,21

M                      dimensions
a                      This figure shows the complexity of interactions between different molecular networks
u                      within the cell that regulate the multitude of cellular functions. The intracellular machinery
s                      must coordinate with surrounding cells and the extracellular microenvironment to achieve
i
t                      homeostasis. Working within the body as a whole, each of these physiologically functional
                       units is tightly coupled and regulated. Accumulated aberrations at the molecular level can
                       decouple any one of these complex interactions and lead to a neoplastic phenotype. The
                       promise of cancer systems biology is the ability to integrate these multi-scale characteristics
                       into cohesive predictive models that can uncover emergent properties to be used in making

                       cancer history.
