Crowdsourcing, a method of information collection which utilizes data received from volunteers, has
been used extensively in disaster response to provide critically lacking or complementary information

during disaster response. A recent approach to its use is in the production of volunteer-produced
information before a disaster takes place. This approach is inherently in line with the requir ements of
disaster preparedness. While significant challenges remain, it has shown noteworthy effects while

better usages ofthe technology are expected.

Introduction and Research Scope


Problematique

        The availability and validity of geographical and geographically-specific information is

considered to be crucial in disaster management and never has it been as ubiquitous as it recently now
it because of information and communications technologies (ICTs) that allow fast and multitudinous

exchange of information between actors. The recent development of crowdsourcing has even pushed

the envelope further by allowing information related to disasters to be generated from the ground up,

using “outsourced” information from volunteers or other actors located in specific disaster situations to

provide a fuller picture of such settings.

        The concept of crowdsourcing has gained its reputat ion and has been operationalized
extensively for disaster response, as evidenced by the case of the earthquake in Haiti in 2010 during

which an online platform called Ushahidi was used extensively to report on the various needs and other

elements important to the disaster-affected population using information gathered thro ugh easily

accessible technologies such as the short message service (SMS) and the internet, and then processed
by volunteers. While there is still a lot to be improved in the way the technology is used, the

participatory element of the platform as well as other crowdsourcing developments has been lauded

and has been considered as democratizing information collection.

        One of the features of crowdsourcing that has not b een fully established is the use of

crowdsourcing methods for disaster preparedness. On one hand, crowdsourcing information for the
purposes of disaster preparedness – such as geographically mapping information on available hospitals

and emergency centers prior to a disaster – could have potential benefits to disaster management. My

research would like to examine the possibilities inherent in such a use of crowdsourcing as well as

provide a synthesis of the various issues and challenges surrounding it.


Research Question

        Main research questions:

How does crowdsourcing play a role in disaster preparedness? What are the issues it has to address?

        Other key questions that would be vital in addressi ng the main research question are:

        •   How and to what extent are ICTs in general used for disaster preparedness? What is the

            conventional model being used and how can it be improved through crowdsourcing?

                                                                                                   1
        •   What are the issues that crowdsourcing in disaster management has to face?

        •   To what extent is crisis mapping through crowdsourc ing supported by different spheres of

            international governance (e.g. at the “headquarters” level of international organizations,

            civil society, etc)?

        •   What is the ideal pre-disaster governance chain to use so that crowdsourced information

            can be used by those who need it the most?
        •   How does crowdsourcing play in humanitarian coordination?


Aims of Research

        The aims of this research are simple. On one hand, this research seeks to open up the discussion

on the various ways in which crowdsourcing has been used for disaster preparedness. Several initiatives

have arisen in the last few years while an academic examination has not been made on it. In a sen se
what this research is trying to achieve is a reorientation at the way crowdsourcing is looked at as a tool

for disaster management – one can think of crowdsourcing as a reactive activity but there are proactive

ways that it can be used too.

        On the other hand, this research is also very basic in terms of scope. Since a systematic

examination has not been done on the topic before, a key aim of this research is to look for key themes

inherent in the experiences of the initiatives on c rowdsourcing for disaster preparedness. This includ es
key functions, origins, impacts and challenges that have been experienced through the initiatives

identified.



Importance of Topic and Contributions to Knowledge

        This research envisages to produce not only academic but also practical value. It envisions to

benefit the humanitarian community in general in the idea that more information on the possibilities
associated with using ICTs in disaster management would provide more options for the better

operations. ICTs are now seriously being considered as viable tools for better humanitarian operations –

this research hopes to confirm and bring weight to this view.

        Academically, this research will add to the growing literature on the nexus between

development, humanitarianism and technology. In particular, the subject of crisis mapping or ICTs for

disaster management is a growing field of study in the academic community. However, analyses made
on the subject tend to be concentrated in the discipline of the information sciences. It is hoped that the

author’s studies in development will reflect a uniq ue approach to the research of the proposed subject .

                                                                                                      2
        In the final steps of the research, the objective is to provide some key recommendations.

Structure of the Research

        This research is divided into several chapters. The first two chapters go over the relevant

concepts related to the subject at hand in order toprovide the context in which the key issues are built.

One chapter is dedicated to the concepts related to disaster preparedness and the current ways in

information and communications technologies (ICTs) are in general used for this phase of disaster

management. The following chapter is dedicated to a review of the research done on crowdsourcing.
The chapter goes over the ways in which crowdsourci ng has predominantly been used in disaster

management, how it has been receivedand what the key issues there have been.

        The next part of the document spells out the main agenda of this research. It starts out with an

explanation of the research gap and the motivations for which this research was pursued – in a nutshell,

it seeks to justify why disaster preparedness could be an essential function of crowdsourcing. The

following sub-chapters lay out the main findings of the research, which was done through the

examination of several crowdsourcing platforms used for disaster preparedness and through interviews

with key implementers of such platforms, and offers a synthesis of the roles that crowdsourcing has had

for disaster preparedness purposes. The next sub-chapter brings up the current challenges and issues
that current initiatives have been facing as well as the opportunities that could be seized to respond to

such issues and further develop the use of the technology. The research finally concludes.

Concepts and Theoretical Framework


        Before proceeding to start off this discussion, the next few pages outline some concepts and

trends that are necessary to accept for this discussion to gain relevance. In a way, they provide the

minimum academic backdrop to inform of the greater context in which the discussion takes place.

Disaster Trends and Global Environmental Changes

        A disaster is defined by the UN Office for Disaster Ris k Reduction (UNISDR) as “A serious

disruption of the functioning of a community or a society involving widespread human, material,

economic or environmental losses and impacts, which exceeds the ability of the affected community or
society to cope using its own resources.” Among the components that lead to the risks of having a

disaster are hazards, man-made or natural. Although the former is also of concern to this discussion, the

latter presents a situation that is considerable to say the least – the number of disasters due to natural

                                                                                                    2
hazards has risen, has caused more casualties and more economic damage than ever before.

         It is not a coincidence that developing countries – especially the poorer pockets of societies in

those countries – suffer most. It has been found that, between 1991 and 2001, countri es with low

human development indexes (HDI) suffered 1,052 deat hs per disaster than the 23 deaths in countries
               3
with high HDI.

         At the same time, the issue of climate change is one that has captured the attention of many

because of the potentially damaging impacts that it can incur on economies and societies in the long

run. While its relation to the magnitude and frequency of natural disasters is often brought up, scientists

have made no explicit announcement that there is a clear connection. Nevertheless, the climate change

discourse, particularly efforts to promote climate change adaptation, is in line with disaster risk


reduction principles in that both inherently deal w ith the risks found in climatic uncertainties.

Disaster Vulnerability and Resilience

         There is a growing consensus now that disasters are not “natural” as they seem. Of course,

natural disasters as we know them today contain a geophysical element (floods, earthquakes, storms,

erosion, etc.). The social sciences approach to the study of disasters has shifted the emphasis away


from natural hazards as the main determinants of disasters. Instead, the way that natural disasters are

regarded should be more comprehensive, where the interplay between geophysical, economic, political
                                                                               5
and social factors to produce “disasters” is seen in an integrated man ner.

         Nowadays, the concept of vulnerability is preferred in explaining the phenomenon of natural

disasters in that it is the vulnerability of certain groups of people that turns natural hazards into

disasters. Vulnerability as a concept refers to the conditions (derived from social, economic and political

processes) that are experienced by groups of people that, with the phenomenon of natural hazards

taking place, leave some groups affected while others unaffected. More specifically, vulnerability is

defined as “the characteristics of a person or group in terms of their capacity to anticipate, cope with,

                                                     7
and recover from the impact of natural hazards.”

         Vulnerability is determined by several factors. Position within a society is one of them – a

person’s class, caste, ethnicity, gender, disability, age or seniority. This means that some groups are

more vulnerable to others. A person or group’s socio-economic position, despite the strong similarities

between the experiences of the vulnerable and the poor in that similar conditions present in poverty

help in resulting to great damage from hazards, is not always a determinant of vulnerability. Exposure to

hazards – natural or otherwise – and the person or group’s ability to adapt their homes, communities

and livelihoods to them, is also a determinant. Vulnerability is cyclical – damages arising from disasters

make households more vulnerable to future hazards an d in the long run works against the recovery of

vulnerable groups the worst.   8

         Resilience is a property, not to be confused as the opposite of vulnerability, referring to the

principles or actions done by stakeholders – both relief organizations and communities – that allows the

promotion of better anticipation, response and recovery to the impacts of hazards. While there are

different capacities in different societies to manage risks – certainly poorer countries are more unlikely

to have the capacity or resources to even respond to disasters – this does not mean that the means to

effectively manage them could not be achieved. Promotion of resilience is a key principle in achieving

this – the mechanisms, capacity and resources exist and are shared to allow vulnerable groups of people

                                          9
access to a greater degree of self-help.

         This being said, the discussion focuses on a phase of disaster management that deals primarily

with having the structures and tools to deal with a disaster scenario. It would be interesting to see how

these concepts apply and are tackled from a crowdsourcing standpoint – how can vulnerability be

determined through crowdsourcing, how is resilience promoted through what ends up being collective

volunteer-produced information?

Theoretical Framework: ICTs as tools for development

        Even though theoretical frameworks on the subject of crowdsourcing exist, an appropriate one

for the purposes of this discussion has not been fo und. However, turning to the more general literature

on the nexus between ICTs and development, several interesting concepts and models are found to

inform and guide the analysis.

        There is a growing appreciation of the role that ICTs play as one key component of the greater

development agenda. While surely one can imagine a number of ways in which ICTs can do this in a

more unique and specialized manner, ICTs’ role for development does not differ significantly from how

it is used elsewhere – ICTs’ capacity to process and communicate potentially valuable data to its

recipients can be used to contribute to learning and decision-making. Moreover, instead of ignoring ICTs

by not looking at it as a viable component for development or, on the other extreme, idolizing ICTs by
looking at it as the pinnacle solution, an integrating approach is preferred. This assumes that ICTs by

themselves are only means to an end, seeing technologies as tools that provide the possibilities and

potentialities for capturing, disseminating and harnessing of impo rtant information within a given socio-

cultural, economic, political and institutional context.0

        The following framework, developed by Heeks (2005) shows the information chain through

which a development agenda can be pursued using ICT s as enabling tools. Even though the analysis in

this discussion does not strictly follow the framework he proposes, it aids the analysis by identifying key

variables that synthesize how actions are decided.

                          Figure1 The Information Chain. Source: Heeks, 2005

        Heeks speaks of four sets of resources that need to be in place in order to make sure that the

information chain takes place  12:

    •   Data Resources: relevant data is needed in the first place

    •   Economic Resources: financial, technological, as well as human capital are also needed

    •   Social Resources: the motivation, confidence and knowledge to access, assess and appl y the

        data

    •   Action Resources: the ability to act on the decisions made using th e information collected and

        other resources

        Despite the fact that the model does not reflect the most explicit function ofcrowdsourcing – to

produce information coming from volunteers – it does show what factors, certainly not limited to

technology, and which actions lead to the productio n of information.

        Taking a look at this from a crowdsourcing perspective, we can see several angles from which

appropriate questions can be asked especially in relation to disaster preparedness. An interesting angle

from which this framework can be viewed is to see the effects crowdsourcing – particularly the benefits

of open and free information – on what kinds of information are produced and how such information is

used. It is also relevant in finding out the kind of environment which enables crowdsourcing in the first

place – to what extent ICTs are accessibleto people, what rationales there are for volunteers to produce

information, etc.

CHAPTER 1 Disaster Preparedness and the Relevance of Information



1.1 Introduction

        This chapter is dedicated to the subject of disaster preparedness. Focus is given on the concepts

that are essential to how it is pursued. A brief summary of what disaster preparedness consists of shall

first be given. The issue of governance – particularly the need to follow up disaster preparedness plans

with real actions – is then discussed. The importance of information is then discussed, detailing in which

form disaster preparedness information ideally consists of and with which channels it is communicated.

1.2 Disaster Preparedness


        Disaster preparedness is a phase in disaster management comprised of measures that allow
different societal units – individuals, households, organizations, and communit ies – to respond more

effectively and recover quickly when a disaster strikes. At the same time, it includes ensuring that the

necessary resources to respond to disasters are in place and that those faced with having to respond will

know how to use them. As a connector between the pre- and post-disaster phases, it seeks the

enhancement of life safety, but also encompasses the goals of improving response activities and coping

capabilities. Preparedness also puts focus on authorities and responsibilities for emergency actions and

the various supporting resources.  13

        As a phase of disaster management that takes place before a crisis occurs and as a part of what

is collectively termed “disaster risk reduction,” which focuses on the identification, assessment and

reduction of disaster risks, disaster preparedness is often considered alongside mitigation, which are

measures pursued for the purpose of avoiding or reducing disaster-related damage. Mitigation comes in

the form of structural measures (e.g. elevating homes for flood protection, and moving neighborhoods

or communities to less hazard-prone locations) and non-structural measures (e.g. enforcement of

building codes, and land use regulations). It also implies that while it is possible that some disaster

effects can be prevented, other effects will persist but can be controlled or reduced through appropriate
       14
action.

        While technically different, there are activities that encompass both phases – such as the

development of warning systems, public education and awareness, formulation of evacuation and

disaster communications – which are viewed as mitigative because they are implemented before a

disaster occurs and considered as preparedness measures because their purpose ultimately is to make

people aware of how to respond when warnings are issued.      15

        The concept of disaster preparedness is composed of dimensions, which are the various goals or

end-states that preparedness aims to achieve, and their respective supporting activities, which are the

concrete measures done to achieve such goals. Table 1 is a synthesis of the eight common dimensions

that preparedness seeks, each with its own set of activities with which the goals are accomplished:

1.2.1 Governance and disaster preparedness


        Often, there is a tendency among disaster management agents to associate disaster

preparedness planning as culminating with a preparedness document. This ideally provides sufficient

evidence for preparedness jurisdictionally but actually fails to understand preparedness as a never-

ending process of planning whereas a plan constitut es only a snapshot of preparedness.

        By a never-ending process, what is meant is the acknowledgement of disaster preparedness as

continuous process in which stakeholders examine their susceptibility towards different hazards

(vulnerability analysis), identify human and material resources to cope with the hazards (capacity

assessment), and identify the formal and informal arrangement by which response and coordination is

to be pursued (plan development). Since the nature of these elements is not static, meaning that

environmental conditions and organizational structures change over time while performance skills

disappear if not exercised, it is important that governance measures be put in place to ensure that
                                                              17
training and planning establish and maintain preparedness.

        Moreover, preparedness planning does not necessarily lead to good emergency response.

Often, there is a gap between what is planned and what is actually experienced in a major disaster

event. Poor planning leads to poor disaster managem ent. As such, it is often due to having the wrong

expectations: planning with a very narrow hazard scope as opposed to factoring in all hazards, planning

segmented as opposed to involving all social factors, and planning that demands activities existing too

much outside of everyday experience.    18

        Nevertheless, human factors make a difference. In particular, commitment on the part of those

who govern to keep citizens safe makes up an ideal preparedness element. The case of Cuba illustrates

this very well. Despite that it does not have as much material and technical leverage that most high-

income states have to deal with disasters, it has time and again showed that it can deal with disasters


more effectively than others – for example, when Hurricane Ivan hit the country in 2004, the
                                                                                                           19
government evacuated nearly two million people resulting in not a single death or serious injury.

Cuba’s strength lies in what IFRC refers to a giving “high priority to human life” that was achieved

through several factors – education (letting citizens know about the risks, effects of disasters and how to
deal with them), awareness and warning (several warning steps are taken as a hurricane approaches)

and popular mobilization (ultimately by joint efforts of the national defense, the Red Cross, and citizens

themselves to evacuate disaster-prone areas). 20

1.2.2 Preparedness Principles


        Over the years, various sets of guidelines have been developed to describe planning activities

that have had high correlations with preparedness. Perry and Lindell (2010:340-347) have synthesized
these guidelines into a set of ten recommendations. According to them, planning should:


    •   based upon accurate knowledge of the threat and of likely human responses – As planning is
        largely based on the knowledge of hazards and vulnerabilities, effort must be placed on

        acquiring the best available knowledge, partly through technology. At the same time, planning

        must also be based not just on the physical science literature on hazards and their effects, but

        also on the behavioral literature describing response patterns of people affected and relief

        organizations.

    •   encourage appropriate actions by emergency managers – While the quickness of response is

        valued, it is not the sole objective of planning. Emphasis must be placed on acquiring the valid

        information on what is happening than to take immediate action and have impulsive reactions.

    •   acknowledge that disasters create dynamic changing environments – This assumes that it is
        impossible to anticipate all contingencies and that incorporation of more and more detail into

        plans inevitably make response more complex. Emphas is should thus be given on the flexibility

        in response flexibility so that responders can adjust to changing demands.

    •   address inter-organizational coordination – Effective response is known to be affected

        substantially by effective coordination among emergency responders. This is achieved through

        the communication between organizations in order for them to be aware of each other’s

        mandates, structures and mechanisms for coordinating scarce resources.

    •   integrate plans for individual hazard into a comprehensive multi-hazard management approach

        – This is based on the assumption that different disaster agents could create similar response

Administration and Development22, no. 5 (2002): 389-91; 99.
                                                                                                      13
    demands, which justifies the creation of similar response strategies and functions to address

    different disaster agents. It also provides multiple opportunities for the use of personnel,

    procedures, facilities and equipment.

•   have a training component – preparedness planning has many audiences to deal wi th – on one

    level, it is concerned with emergency responders, and elected officials and public administrators

    who do not necessarily have a role in emergencies. On another level, it is also concerned with

    the public. The purpose of training is to guide the audience to effectively execute the agreed
    emergency protocols. It takes the form of risk communication, which is oriented to educational

    exchanges with audiences. It also takes the form of specific training with emergency response

    organizations, focusing on specific protocols and processes.

•   provide for testing proposed response operations – Emergency drills and exercises provide

    multiply opportunities. Firstly, it could serve as a chance to critically examine operational details

    such as plans, staffing levels and procedures. Moreover, it also serves as a way for response
    organizations to develop personal relationships with one another. Lastly, it provides the general

    public with the awareness that preparedness is unde r way.

•   be a continuous process – As the conditions leading that could affect the gravity of an

    emergency – the nature of the hazard, the resources available in an organization, among other

    things – change from time to time, it is necessary to detect, monitor and respond to these

    changes. Planning, never to be considered as “compl ete,” is a process that requires continuous
    updating.

•   be conducted in the face of conflict and resistance – There is often objection raised by public

    officials towards allocating resources towards planning based on the rationalization that

    planning makes use of resources that could be used for other pressing purposes. Despite this,

    planning involves allocation of power and resources, and advocacy despite resistance.

•   recognize that planning and management are different functions, and that the true test of the

    plan is in its implementation during an emergency – Emergency response should not be
    confused with planning. It implies performance – meeting the exigencies of the emergency by

    implementing the “assessment, corrective, protective and coordinating actions” defined in

    planning stage.






                                                                                                 14
1.3 Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) in Disaster Preparedness


        The use of information and communications technologi es (ICTs) in disaster management has

been considered more and more seriously because of the potentials it has in anticipating,

communicating and organizing actions before, during and after disaster events. Now more than ever,

the wide and inexpensive variety of communication means and the diverse ways in which inf ormation is

passed on has helped in making sure that the advantages of using technology is not only in the hands of
“big leagues.” Instead, the advantage of technology in disaster management could be held precisely by

those whoever has access to it – whether it be the emergency responder or the first to witness a hazard

strike – wherever he or she is.


1.3.1 The roleof information in Disaster Management

        The role of ICTs in disaster management can be traced primarily to its facilitation of access to

timely and critical information related to disasters. As noted by Marrku Niskala, former secretary-

general of IFRC, information is a vital form of aid in itself: “People need information as much as water,
                                                                                             21
food, medicine or shelter. Information can save lives, livelihoods and resources.”              Without it,

experience has shown that the consequences are negative, not only in terms of physical recovery but
                                                                                    22
also psychosocially by increasing stress and trauma of those affected by disasters.

        The value of information is felt at all times of a disaster situation. Especially important at the

onset of a disaster, during which information is considered a lifeline of those affected by disasters but

during which it is scarce and often unreliable, information is needed for people affected to find

assistance. In due course, information becomes vital for those affected in knowing their options to

recover and shape their own future, which reveals its empowering effect. More importantly, today, a

critical difference of information lies in the fact that communication is not only a one-way street –

humanitarian institutions are realizing the benefits of not just passing information but also having a

dialogue and receiving information from those who used to be its recipients. At the same time, the

production of information is no longer in the hands of such institutions – the aftermath of the

        As emphasized previously, disaster management is dependent on the communication between

the different actors in a disaster setting, especially when it comes to coordination. This is where

transparency and open information flows are needed. On one hand, having these enables better

collaboration and maximization of the competitive advantage of each actor and of the contributions to

fighting vulnerabilities – communities have access to local knowledge that helps in mitigation efforts

while national governments can oversee the provision of basic services and regulations. On the other

hand, open information flows contribute to the building of resilience by making communities aware of

the risks and hazards they could encounter so that t hey could mobilize to protect themselves.    24

                                                                                                     25
several features must be realized by humanitarian agencies, governments and local communities          :

     •   Information flows must be two-way to be effective – Flows exist from the international

         community to the affected population. However, information must also come from those

         affected to humanitarian agencies.

     •   Information must come from trusted sources for it to be useful – People are part of the

         communication system. The social context in which information is collected is thus important.

     •   Information must be accurate for it be helpful – Authentication of information is vital because

         there are risks in unregulated information flow, especially as it spreads rapidly online.

        Each phase of disaster management is contingent to information for different humanitarian

actors to work with.As is often the case, disasters present a context in which uncertainty and high stress

is prevalent, which is why information ideally needs to be present and accessible beforehand. Yap

(2011) has summed up in the following table the information types necessary for each phase of disaster

management:

1.3.2 ICTs and Disaster Management


        Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs), by themselves, are not the solutions to
disasters. Rather, they form an integral part of disaster management and acts as an enabler of

communication flows and facilitator of coordination. In all phases of disaster management, ICTs allow

the fast production of information to multiple audiences, which depending upon the con text – the exact

moment at which requests for information are done in proximity to a disaster – changes in terms of

magnitude, quantity and quality.

        Essential to the explanation of how ICTs in disaster management is the understan ding of the
different communication flows which ICTs permit. This refers to the relationship between the conveyer

and the receiver, or audience, of information. A strong feature of ICTs is that enables information to be

conveyed in all ways possible – between two actors (one-to-one), one conveyer to a large and often

targeted audience (one-to-many), or between a large group of conveyers to another large group of large

group of audience with the distinction of conveyer-receiver being blurred (many-to-many).
















Figure2 Communication Flows

        In disaster management, two-way information flows are needed to effectively establish

communications between those communities at risk or those already affected and emergency

institutions. The following are categories of technologies used in disaster management, each with its

own sets of advantages:

        Mobile Technologies– Mobile technology – particularly through cellular phones – has been one

of the fastest-rising technologies and is also the reason why it is considered that more than half of the
world’s population already has access to ICTs. In disaster management, mobile technology has been

used by emergency institutions to communicate between each other. Its main purpose, however, is for


                                                                                                   18
sending early warning messages, as in the case of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, where a Sri-Lankan-

developed SMS-based (short messaging service) early warning system was used to notify public officials,

who then communicated the warning to concerned citizens, of an impending tsunami.


         Developments have since been made in mobile technologies, particularly in relation to the way

in which messages are relayed to specific targets. Cell broadcasting is a one-to-many geographically-

focused messaging used to target mobile subscribers confined within a given network coverage and is,
                                                                                         27
as added benefits, inexpensive to implement and not affected by traffic load.               The International

Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in 2010, for example, made use of cell broadcasting

in Haiti, through its TERA platform, to provide early warning to Haitians but also to communicate their
                                                            28
public health campaign and cholera prevention schem es.

         Space-based Technologies – Space-based technologies are a category of a variety of

technologies that are increasingly considered as improving the performance of all phases in disaster

management. Remote Sensing makes use of sensors mounted on satellites or aircrafts to produce

information and record information that could be on specific geographical points repeatedly over

extended periods, thus enabling the monitoring of changes in the environment and human processes.

Its strategic advantage is in helping scientists predict changes and patterns of events.

         Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are essentially a fusion of cartography and database


technologies. They allow the production of interactive maps, situational analyses and presentation of
                                      29
information in a variety of ways.        Its power lies in the ability to integrate spatial data with non-

geographic data and displaying graphically spatial patterns. GIS has been used extensively for the

purpose of mapping and monitoring of risks for early warning, as well modeling possible situations in the

context of disaster preparedness, mitigation and response.

        The combination of GIS, remote sensing, as well as developments in geo-location technologies

(i.e. through Global Positioning Systems or GPS), allows the creation of a better operational picture,

aiding those concerned is all phases of disaster management.    30

        Radio – Radio is a technology that has been used to a considerable extent in all phases of

disaster management. On one hand, it has been used extensively in times of disaster responseespecially

when other communications means fail. This takes the form of amateur radio composed of local

volunteers licensed to provide communication facilities in emergency situations and satellite radio,

which is used to communicate hazard information directly to communities at risk. On the other hand,

radio has also been used significantly to broadcast early warning messages or public

awareness/education purposes.    31

        Internet – The internet has become a vast information infrastructure that has allowed multiple

and creative ways for information to be shared and d eveloped. On one hand, the internet has been used

as a means to communicate information, particularly the needs, casualties and damages during a

disaster. On the other hand, it has also been used extensively as a means of sharing and storing

informative resources, especially for disaster response. Several developments have been spurred by the

need to have authorities on disaster information – good examples are Global Disaster Alert and

Coordination System (GDACS) of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which

provides real-time updates on natural disaster events, and ReliefWeb, one among the host of

repositories on disaster-related information.

        Another important technological trend today is the ongoing convergence between multiple

technologies, blurring the line and scope of what their traditional functions are. The development in

terms of interactivity – in the form of social networking in websites like Facebook and Twitter – as well

as capturing content using present mobile technologies , has broadened the sources for potential data

and information.  32


1.3.3 Disaster Preparedness Applications of ICTs

        As mentioned previously, disaster preparedness is l argely dependent on knowledge and

awareness of the hazards and risks present in a given geographical and social context. The advantages of

ICT extend to the several ways in which they are applied for disaster risk reduction. On one hand, ICTs

have been used in the identification and mapping of risks, monitoring them and modeling potential

situations. On the other hand, ICTs have also been used for the purpose of managing ris ks using the
                33
available tools.   Their application to disaster preparedness can be described with the following

functional categories:

Citizen Organization and Public Participation

        One of the most important developments to have come outas a feature of ICTs is the capability

it gives its users to participate in a phenomenon more closely. ICTs have enabled stakeholders to

participate in disaster preparedness and response. The internet, in particula r, has been leveraged in

order for concerned citizens to share and guide each other in preparing and becoming the “first

responders” to disasters. Online forums (or wikis) such as     www.fluwikie.com    have allowed citizens to

inform each other of the public health plans when an influenza strikes, and to cooperate to come up
with informal solutions should an influenza strike.    34 Similarly, other collaborative websites such as

www.emergency20wiki.org allow users to share best practices on using this host of new technological

tools in preparation for disasters.

        Perhaps the latest wave of preparedness-oriented ICT applications lies in crowdsourcing.

Crowdsourcing, as we shall see in the next chapter, makes use of ICTs and the willingness of volunteers

to share content to collectively come up with information that could serve as solutions to different

problems.

Geographic information for disaster preparedness


        Geographic information has occupied an important place in disaster management in general and
has had a unique role for pre-disaster purposes. Through the use of geographic information systems

(GIS), disaster management institutions have been able to plan for disaster preparedness starting with

the identification and modeling of hazards (such as fault lines and flood zones) and vulnerabilities (such

as weak structural integrity of infrastructure and weak mobility of communities) inherent in a given

geographical context. Planners make use of such information, in the form of computer-generated risk

maps, to create the appropriate strategies and actions in order to mitigate risks – through various

means as implementing zoning legislation or strengthening current infrastructure – or to pursue
                   35
protective action.

         GIS has also been proven to be valuable in transiti oning between the preparedness and

response by providing information on resources and centers needed for disaster response such as the

location of storage facilities and hospitals.  36Moreover, GIS has become a strategic tool in the area of

mobility during disasters. GIS is used to provide location information on street name s that may have

been wiped out during a catastrophe. GIS can also b e used for evacuation planning in the form of

contingency planning and modeling for evacuation ro utes.      37


Databases for Preparedness Planning

         The need for information in all phases of a disaster has given rise to specialized software

applications in the form of disaster management information systems (DMIS). Such applications are

essentially repositories of information, collected before, during and after a disaster, with the specific

purpose of aiding disaster management institutions.

         For the purposes of preparedness, the trend in usin g DMIS has been to proactively store critical


information in the form of baseline data on the risks in a given geographical context. The American Red

Cross, for example, developed a “Community Disaster Information System” to prepare for disaster

response by involving the different Red Cross chapters across the country and its volunteers in collecting

and collecting data on names, addresses, online Google maps, phone numbers, web site addresses,

hours of operation, general descriptions of services, Red Cross-specific relationships, languages spoken,

and other information for community-based resources, which was shared with NGO responde rs and

community-based suppliers and volunteers to enhance collabora tion.        38

         The data that is stored then goes through processing and take final shape in several forms. As

mentioned before, geographical information can be turned into risk maps. Some others are transformed

into information presented in handheld applications , mobile devices or portable systems as reference

for responders. Others could be used as a bases for public information and awareness.       39


1.3.4 Barriers

         Still, a relevant assumption for ICTs to be effectively used in disaster management is that the

proper infrastructure is present or is feasible to be set up. The problem at hand is that many groups of

people in developing countries do not have access to ICTs. On one hand, this “Digital Divide” is

symptomatic of countries where governments are reluctant to invest on ICT infrastructure to give way

to other development priorities. On the other hand, this could also make the task of disaster

management more unmanageable as reliance on technology, despite how efficient it is, is rendered

useless when it cannot reach those who need it most. As IFRC notes, there is a need to focus efforts,

through a mixture of technological and non-technological solutions, on the “last mile communication” to

reach those who are the most vulnerable to hazards and who are also the hardest to communicate.          41


1.4 Conclusions

         Disaster preparedness is concerned with providing the arrangements that facilitate proper

response to emergency situations. Experience has shown that preparedness plans do not automatically

lead to action – a culture of constant preparation, anticipation and, more importantly, decisive action


not just by response institutions but ideally also by communities is crucial. The use of ICTs in disaster

preparedness can be looked at in two ways. The first is to prepare for emergencies by physically having

the proper infrastructure to provide the means for communication during response. The second is to

provide information that could be used for preparedness purposes – this is especially relevant in hazard

identification and analysis as well as for informing communities or individuals of present risks, possible

scenarios and contingency actions.

CHAPTER 2 Crowdsourcing: Concepts and Issues in times of crisis



2.1 Introduction

        The purpose of this chapter is to provide backgroun d information on the technologies, concepts

and contexts that are relevant in the use of crowdsourcing for disaster preparedness. Also, to link these

to the discussion on preparedness – why it is would be advantageous to do mapping to pr epare for

disasters

2.2 Crowdsourcing History


        Crowdsourcing is a recent phenomenon and a “business model” grounded in using the general

public, or the “crowd”, for the purpose of utilizing their talent, skills or opinions as sources of knowledge

and expertise for production and problem-solving, and enabled by developments in information and

communications technologies (ICTs) such as web 2.0, which emphasizes interactivity between the user

and the internet, and mobile technologies, which en able capturing contextual information. A

portmanteau of the words “crowd” and “outsourcing,” it emphasizes both collaboration and

competition.

        Crowdsourcing works as follows: a “crowdsourcer” – an institution or company wishing to gain

information for a particular problem or project – broadcasts a request, in the form of a problem or a

question, to a targeted community, the "crowd.” Those in the crowd who have ideas and proposals then

submit their feedback autonomously or in some kind of coordinated fashion. The motivations behind

individual submissions vary as some seek for intellectual recognition or satisfaction of philanthropic
                                                                                                42
desire, or monetary rewards as in the case of companies handing out cash prizes for best ideas.

        The benefits of crowdsourcing are many and, in its traditional use in business, can be
                                    43
summarized in the following points   :

        •   Crowdsourcing connects businesses to its audiences and consumers

        •   Solutions arrived at through crowdsourcing could be better than those produced by

            traditional outsourcing

        •   It keeps overhead and administration costs for small companies at a minimum since it relies

            on the freelancing community

        •   It could provide opportunities for unknown or emerg ing innovators, designers or thinkers

        However, as we will see the applications of crowdsourcing is not only limited to the sphere of

business.

2.3 Volunteered Geographic Information

        The act of sourcing information from the crowd has not been as visible as in the area of

geographic information, once considered an authoritative field in which only people with technical

background and with sufficient mandate (e.g. working for a government mapping agency or

commissioned private agency) could be responsible f or. Today, online platforms such as WikiMapia,

Open Street Map and Google Map Maker encourage users to contribute local knowledge in the

production and elaboration of geographic information.

        This phenomenon – the use of tools by individuals often with little formal qualification to create,

assemble and disseminate geographic information – has been entitled by Goodchild (2007) as
                                            44
Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). As such, VGI has been used in a wide variety of sit uations

from filling previously unavailable geographic information (such as street names), highlighting points of

interests (such as restaurants, tourist spots and government agencies), and, of course, as a form of early

warning for impending disasters.

        VGI has been enabled by a number of factors. On one hand, the phenomenon was made

possible by advances in technologies, particularly the increasing availability of inexpensive and

sophisticated technologies such as Global Positioning Systems (GPS) that help in tracking locations based
on specified coordinates. This has been complemente d and strengthened by developments in the

internet in the form of Web 2.0, which has allowed unprecedented user interaction, collaboration and

content production; and data structures through geotagging and georeferencing of user-generated

geographic information.

        On the other hand, the phenomenon of VGI was also enabled by citizen organization. VGI is now

considered an essential attribute of public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS), which

seeks to bring established GIS practices to local levels of societies. Today, although the accuracy and

legitimacy of VGI are from time to time put in question, it is nevertheless considered as a reliable source

of information. Proponents of VGI argue that the issue of VGI is not one of accuracy and legitimacy but

rather of rethinking how volunteers are used in order to make better collaboration between them and

authorities.45


2.3.1 Benefits of Volunteered Geographic Information

        Volunteered geographic information provides several benefits when compared to traditional

sources of geographic information. While governments are increasingly becoming unwilling to pay for

the costs of producing geographic information, VGI costs less and is easy to produce. With the proper

infrastructure to organize VGI, the collected information would be usable in forming a coherent and

accurate “patchwork.” Sometimes, VGI is the only source of geographic information, particularly where

geographic information is treated as an issue of national security.

        VGI also gives access to intelligence at the local level that may mostly go unperceived. VGI gives

stakeholders the chance to access information that is not featured in the spotlight by traditional

media. Thus, one of the most important values of VGI lies in the contextual awareness that it provides.


2.3.2 Social Impact of Volunteered Geographic Information

        As with the general phenomenon of crowdsourcing, on e might wonder what accounts for

volunteers’ willingness to participate in the production of VGI. Studies done show that the average

volunteer profile would be either an “expert amateur,” who would know a great deal about a given

subject but not practice it as a profession, or at worst an “interested amateur,” who has discovered

interest in a subject and is gaining experience on it. The positive motivations of volunteers could be

broken down into the following reasons: altruism; personal or professional interest; intellectual

stimulation; protection or enhancement of a personal investment; social reward; enhanced personal
                                                                                                  47
reputation; provides an outlet for creative and independent self-expression; pride of place.        While, as

we shall see, these classifications are not as simple as they seem, the sheer fact of having voluntary

contributions has produced remarkable social impacts.

        Volunteered geographic information has been considered as contributing to the growing

reversal of the traditional top-down approach to the production and distribution of geographic

information. National mapping agencies are no longer as active in mapping as they once were and do

not update maps as regularly as they used to while developing countries have a hard time sustaining
                                               48
national mapping and information collection. As was mentioned earlier, the act of sourcing geographic

information from volunteers is now considered a force behind participatory engagements in the

production of geographic information. Perceptions on the role of volunteers are changing from what

was once primarily a passive recipient of information to an active and potentially over-abundant source

of information.

        At the same time, VGI has the potential of changing the way that citizens and governments

interact. VGI could on one hand make citizen concern s be more visible to the state and leverage public

opinions. It could also be used as a tool for the accountability of state actions by visualizing public

interest issues such as service provision and by ap plying citizen pressure to the state without having to
                        49
deal with bureaucracy.

2.4 Crowdsourcing and Disaster Management


        The last few years have seen the realization of the potentials of crowdsourcing and the use of
volunteered geographic information in the propagation and collection of critical real-time disaster

information. Across the world, various platforms leveraging electric networks and social computing tolls

have been set up in which citizens could report on issues and events that directly affect them – from

electoral fraud, monitoring missing persons to the identification of various needs for responding to

disasters – then aggregated to provide contextual awareness of the situations that are at hand.

        Crowdsourcing in disaster management primarily take the form of two activities: producing

platforms for the contribution of voluntary information regarding response needs and activities, and

crisis mapping, which seeks to redraw or update maps of disaster-stricken areas and show such maps

online for a free license.

2.4.1 Contributive platforms

         One of the most visible ways in which crowdsourcing has been used in recent years is through

the creation of platforms in which volunteers or disaster-affected populations could submit reports of

their needs and concerns through a variety of means such as through texting or short message service

(SMS), email and most recently through smart phone applications. The information is then processed to

be visualized onto a centralized map visible for public inspection and verification, and as a source of

information for relief operations.


         By far the most known platform for crowdsourcing is Ushahidi, established in Kenya in 2008

originally to produce local information from the public using an online platform or SMS to anonymously
                                                                                                   50
report on violence and other illegal phenomena during the electoral process at the time.              Its most

compelling use has been in the 2010 Haiti earthquake, where it was largely used as a source of

information for the various needs of those affected (e.g. medical care, shelter, food, etc) and a tool to
                                                                                                 51
create accurate maps that were used by humanitarian actors and search and rescue teams.

         As the disaster in Haiti eased out, Ushahidi Haiti’s use transitioned to more of a disaster

recovery tool pointing to the locations of damaged infrastructure needing repair or to those of medical

services. Since then, Ushahidi has been used in a number of other situations, notably the Christchurch

earthquake in 2011.

2.4.2 Crisis Mapping

        Another way in which social computing tools and electronic networks use the crow d is through

crisis mapping. As such, crisis mapping is used to create maps in cases where official maps are damaged

or lacking relevant information, such as street names, or to update existing base maps and data, such as

hospital locations.

        Platforms such as OpenStreetMap allow volunteer geographers, who have specific knowledge in
order to identify locations or who have the skills to draw geographically-specific information such as

road networks, to collaborate and communicate remotely. It facilitates the collection and visualization

of geographic information, which allows for the proper analysis and response to the situation. It is

noteworthy that crisis mapping has since spawned a number of volunteer networks such as

Crisiscommons or The International Network of Crisis Mappers consisting of members who on one hand






                                                                                                    29
collaborate in times of crisis to produce maps and also engage themselves to develop new tools and
                                                               52
ways of doing things to improve their response to disasters.

2.4.3 Map Mashups

         Map mashups are not necessarily crowdsourcing platf orms in the sense that they process


volunteered geographic information. However, they typically involve aggregating different data sources

from authoritative and non-authoritative sources. These sources mainly come from national disaster

response agencies, contributive platforms such as Ushahidi, social networks such as Twitter and other

media providers such as Flickr and Youtube which provide geo-tagged photo and video content. The

purpose of mashups is to provide situational awareness of a disaster situation.    54

2.5 Positive effects of Volunteered Geographic Information on Disaster Management


        This new way of utilizing the various online and mob ile technologies by the general public to

produce disaster-related geographic information has produced a number of positive impacts for disaster

management.

2.5.1 Transformation of Information Flows

        For one thing, the pace at which volunteered geographic information in disaster situations is

produced is amazing to say the least. This rapid production of geographic information definitely aids and

substitutes in cases where official mapping, which takes time and for which states have l ess and less

resources to devote to, does not produce a set of tools that could immediately aid in emergency

response. The benefit of volunteered geographic information lies in its ability to rapidly reflect the

                                                                              57
context of the situation and capture changes as fast as they take place. Port-au-Prince is strong case-

in-point where, before the infamous earthquake of 2010 official maps had little updated information,

2000 volunteers quickly jumped in to generate different layers on OpenStreetMap which emergency
                                                              58
responders then used to make their way through the city.

         Furthermore, crowdsourced information has the capacity to complement official reports

distributed by relief organizations. Especially in situations where information on disaster-affected areas

and populations is hard to come by due to difficulties in access, volunteer reports are especially useful

since they fill the gap that is not immediately known. This complementarity is fully utilized through the

existing technology that allows data to be intercha nged and aggregated in map mashups, providing a

more holistic view of disaster situations. As such it also blurs the distinctions between amateur- and


professionally-produced information and, as with the other general applications of volunteered

geographic information, shifts the production and distribution of information from a top-down to a
                                                         59
bottom-up approach, changing hierarchical relations.

2.5.2 Contributions to Resilience


         The concept of disaster resilience is used to refer to the principles or actions done by

stakeholders – both relief organizations and communities – that promote better anticipation, response

and recovery to the impacts of natural hazards. In e ssence, it is through the promotion of resilience

through all phases of disaster management that the possibility of hazards turning into disasters is

reduced.

         One facet that distinguishes resilience as a concept is its emphasis on communities’ self-

organization and self-sufficiency, meaning that strategies and actions could exist enabling themselves to

prepare, respond and “bounce forward” from a disaster. Revealing the capacities of communities to be


adaptive, resourceful, and creative, social media and crowdsourcing have helped communities help
                                                              60                                      61
themselves and as such contributes to pursuing resi lience. This has been done mainly through :

2.6 Issues of Crowdsourcing in Disaster Management

        While the general increasing trend of using crowdso urced information intuitively sends a

positive message about its usefulness, experience has shown that there are several important issues

needing resolution for it to be further be effectivelyused.

2.6.1 Data Validity


        By far the most critical issue that crowdsourcing faces is related to the validity of data that are
received from volunteers. The issue is crucial to all crowdsourcing operations but has more weight in the

case of humanitarian situations, calling for better ways of verification and increased vigilance among the

public.

        Volunteered geographic information is particularly prone to having inaccurate and incorrect

information. These can be a result of either mischievous intent due to vandals which legitimate content

with nonsensical or offensive content; individuals or groups with a particular agenda, which might not

necessarily be true; or individuals or groups with malicious or criminal intent wishing to put false

content for personal gain. Crowdsourced information in disaster operations has not been spared from

such attacks – for example, fraudulent geographic information coul d be provided by a group with the
                                                        62
intention of hijacking a convoy containing relief goods.

2.6.2 Information Management

         Questions of information management point to the quantity and quality of data received. On


one hand, quantity of data can be an issue in situa tions where mountains of data are received. Especially

following the onset of a disaster, this may be an issue for emergency responders who may not have the
                                                                 63
resources (i.e. time) to sift through all data coming through.

         What adds to the complications of managing crowdsourced information is the quality of data. As

mentioned above, this is related to the extent to which data received is true. But at the same time, one

of the hurdles disaster response institutions have to face is the verification of the data, for which there is

                                                                                               64
a need to quickly do so in order to find reliable bases for decision-makers to work with.

         Lastly, there is also a need to consider how information is shared and coordinated. On one hand,

there is a need for better inter-operability of systems, meaning to say the extent to which data could be

passed on from one institution to another with ease, in order to make information collection more

efficient and reduce redundancies.     65It is also important for the humanitarian and development sector

to realize the license restrictions on available platforms – already, concerns were raised when Google


and the World Bank announced a partnership to use G oogle’s Map Maker in developing countries, using

local volunteers’ crowdsourced information for Google’s profit but more importantly containing several
                                                                                                                66
provisions that may make it difficult for other institutions to make use of information in the platform.

On the other hand, the willingness of institutions to share information and likewise the willingness and

readiness of states to allow citizens, who may also be volunteers, free and unrestricted access to

information resources are also critical issues since they determine public participation in providing

volunteered information.    67

2.6.3 Infrastructural Conditions


        Another category of issues that requires further thinking is related to the ability of users and

producers of crowdsourced geographic information to access the technical infrastructure required to

communicate information – in the form of broadband and wireless communications networks.

        On one hand the issue is deeply embedded in a state’s current level of development. Particularly

for many developing countries, which might not have established broadband connectivity in general, the
                                              68
“digital divide” is still very much a problem. After all, even with the willingness to communicate what is

happening on the ground, volunteers would not be ab le to send their information without having the

proper tools to do so.

        On the other hand, the infrastructure itself may be lost or damaged by disasters that the

technological solutions were trying to overcome in the first place. Also, there is a tendency for

communications infrastructure to be saturated when a disaster strikes. If disaster management

completely relies on the technologies, then it is effectively rendered useless. This is why there is a need

for adaptability and complementarity of all communication means.      69


2.7 In defense of crowdsourcing

        Nevertheless, further academic research on the subject of crowdsourcing provides arguments

addressing some of the issues discussed above.


2.7.1 Data Verification

        The issue of data quality requires that a robust and fast system of verification in order for the

information to achieve a certain level of reliability. One of the strengths of that comes from the

combination of electronic networks and social computing applications is the potential to harness

collective intelligence to assess and evaluate information sources. The “wisdom” of crowds through the

use of social computing tools effectively substitutes for the weight of the credibility and authority in
                        70
traditional institutions.

         Nevertheless, this benefit is only realized in situations which assume that there an ample

amount of volunteers willing to verify information. In situations where users may not be as involved due

to a wide variety of reasons – such as being cut off from communications infrastructure and tools, or

simply the lack of volunteers – the verification process might not be as effective or be non-existent. This

is one of the issues that crowdsourcing in rapid di saster response such as Ushahidi.     71

         Still, the risk of getting false information may not be as bad as it seems. One of the

distinguishing factors behind disaster information is that it is time-critical, meaning to say that the

seriousness to which a disaster unfolds depends on the response to it and, more importantly, the speed

at which information is received. Errors are not desirable but, in terms of costs, it is often less costly to

act on information or rumors that are not true (what are called false positives) than to not act on the

basis of not having any information about an event (or false negatives). The strength of crowdsourcing


and volunteered geographic information is its potential to quickly provide a basis to authenticate false
          72
positives.

2.8 Conclusions


         Crowdsourcing has become a viable tool in the production and distribu tion of information that is

lacking during a disaster. Significant challenges remain especially concerning the quality of information

that is produced. Nevertheless, by coming up with v olunteer-produced information on necessary relief

resources on crowd maps to rapidly but intricately-produced maps produced by volunteer geographers,

the act of crowdsourcing does show that it could potentially change the way information is collected

and used in disaster management as a whole. The next chapter tries to elaborate on such possibilities by

focusing on crowdsourcing’s usage in disaster prepa redness.

CHAPTER 3 Crowdsourcing for Disaster Preparedness



3.1 Pre-crisis crowdsourcing Introduction

        Since the arrival of crowdsourcing in disaster management, the focus of implementation has for

the most part been in disaster response. While, as we have seen, crowdsourcing has become a viable

force in the production and distribution of information during a disaster, there is some reason to believe

that this approach could be improved.

        Response is critical during the first 48 hours of a disaster. As noted before, in the case of

geographic information, maps are not always available or government agencies might be reluctant to

share what they have with response institutions. Cr owdsourcing for disaster response, through the

production of geographic information during a disaster, is inherently a reactive activity, meaning to say

that it only takes place when a disaster has already taken place. This is also the worst time to produce

information, since responders may already be facing severe pressure while the information for them to

work with may not be ready for days or weeks after or might no t say enough about human geography or

needs. 73 74


        As some disaster responders have argued, the period before a disaster would be the ideal time

to produce disaster-related information in the form of geographic information or otherwise. The

challenge is to identify motivation to build information before a crisis, especially for developing

countries which might not necessarily have the resources to maintain the information platforms
regularly. Nevertheless, if viewed from a disaster preparedness perspective coupled with quotidian and

customary use for other non-disaster management purposes, this approach gains viability.      75


        Thus for the past few years, a number of actors have identified the possibilities inherent in

crowdsourcing for a variety of uses before a crisis occurs. This proactive approach to crowdsourcing in

anticipating for the possibilities that different hazards will bring is a novel step to the use of ICTs for

disaster management and is bound to produce results .

3.2 The Research

        Because there has not been a systematic examination of crowdsourcing use for disaster

preparedness before, the task at hand is to open up the discussion and identify the reasons, motivatio ns

and usages of crowdsourcing for disaster preparedness. This research shall be done by examining the

various initiatives in which crowdsourcing has been used for disaster preparedness in the hope of
identifying its consistency with crowdsourcing as u sed in disaster response but more importantly to

bring to the fore its issues, the advantages and disadvantages in its usag e, and the possibilities and

future opportunities for this relatively recent phenomenon.

3.3 Methodology


        The research was mainly done through the examination of various information sources related
to crowdsourcing for disaster preparedness. Semi-structured interviews were done with three

institutions working first-hand and primarily in crowdsourcing through setting up the means throu gh

which crowdsourcing could be achieved. Representatives were interviewed from the following

institutions: NiJel, an organization the provides crowdsourcing services related to slow/non-acute crises;

the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, an organization that provides support to build local capacity in

using technologies to make use of and build upon the OpenStreetMap technology; and the Honduras
Health Mapping Project, a project that sought to map medical infrastructure, as well as other disaster-

related resources, in Honduras. A representative from the Kenya office of UN Office for the Coordination

of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) – an institution working as a coordinating agency but which likewise

makes use of crowdsourcing as a method of collecting information – was also sought and interviewed.

    The purpose behind the interviews is to elicit key themes that emerge in pre-crisis crowdsourcing,

particularly in the way such initiatives are oriented towards preparedness. The interviews were done

with the following themes in mind:

    •   Preparedness as a function of the institution and t he importance of governance
    •   The use of and experience with crowdsourced informa tion for disaster preparedness

    •   The use of volunteers as a means for obtaining information

        The interviews were conducted in a span of three weeksremotely through skype. The interview

length averaged at fifty minutes per interview. The interviews were recorded and notes were taken.






                                                                                                      39
                                                                                                  iii
         Apart from this, examinations were done of each of the crowdsourcing platforms set up by

these institutions, as well as a few others who have been contacted but not been able to take part in an

interview. The purpose of doing this was to draw out the basic functionalities in each platform.

         Lastly, one consultation was done with a preparedness planner to elicit the ways in which

crowdsourcing as a disaster preparedness tool could be brought further. This was done after all

interviews and examinations took place.

3.4 Research Findings - Introduction

        This chapter lays out the findings of the research. In a sense, the aim of this chapter is to put a

different spin on the way in which crowdsourcing is looked at as a tool for disaster management by
looking at it from a disaster preparedness perspective.

        This chapter takes a basic look at the different components that make crowdsourcing a tool for

disaster preparedness and the different kinds of preparedness-related information that is produced

through crowdsourcing. It then provides a synthesis of the functions that crowdsourcing has entailed f or

disaster preparedness. Lastly, the profiles of volunteers, those who submit crowdsourced information, is

also looked at.

3.5 How is crowdsourcing used for disaster preparedness?

        The applications of crowdsourcing to disaster preparedness encompasses activities aimed at

providing different kinds of information that could help preparedness efforts through complementing

existing information or through the provision of otherwise inexistent preparedness-related information.

In the cases that have been studied, crowdsourcing for disaster preparedness, much like crowdsourcing
for disaster response, can primarily be categorized according to the “final product” for which

crowdsourcing methods are used:

    •   Pre-Crisis Mapping – As mentioned before, crisis mapping, the act of pro ducing or updating

        cartographic information in cases where little or no information is available in a given location

        during a disaster, has spawned a great number of initiatives (most notably, Haiti). In contrast to

        this, several initiatives exist which seek to make use of the opportunities available before a
        disaster strikes to map out a given area which has previously been information-scarce.

    •   Pre-Crisis Volunteered Information – Similar to volunteered information in other phases of a

        disaster, the emphasis is on submitting information that pertains to the needs of a given area or

        community. The difference predominantly lies in the pre-emptive approach through which

        crowdsourcing is used and, interestingly, the types of disasters that are tackled.

3.6 What kinds of information are produced/received?

        The different kinds of information to be produced/received through crow dsourcing for disaster

preparedness, as most of the interviewees expressed, depend on the request that is sent out and, as

such, is unlimited in terms of scope. These reveal onone hand the different end goals a crowdsourcing



                                                                                                     41
has for a project and on the other hand the important elements present in pre-disaster situations that

make crowdsourcing largely beneficial for preparedness.

3.6.1 Means of capturing information

        Like most crowdsourcing, the means of capturing volunteered information comes from widely

available technologies. Very briefly, they are the following:

    •   Ushahidi platform – naturally, as one of the leading platforms for crowdsourcing, several

        institutions have adopted it for their own purposes and locales.

    •   Short Message Service (SMS) – SMS has been a cheap and reliable way of both receiving and

        broadcasting crowdsourced information. The free software Frontline SMS has been used

        extensively by institutions in receiving and managing messages.
    •   Fixed telephony (landline) – The standard landline phones are still used to make calls to call

        centers operated by humanitarian institutions

    •   Global Positioning System (GPS) – GPS has been used (notably by the Humanitarian

        OpenStreetMap Team) in producing location information for infrastructure important for

        preparedness functions.

3.6.2 Hazard Information

        Owing to the opportunity afforded in pre-disaster situations, particularly the availability of time

to observe and prepare for upcoming phenomena, crow dsourcing has the ability to capture disaster-
related information that may otherwise be too late to capture once a disaster has already taken place.

Chief among them are different hazards that may cause disasters to take place.

        The types of hazards that are covered through crowdsourcing range from natural to man-made

phenomena. The Saskatchewan Floods portal, for example, makes use of crowdsourcing technique s to

map out flood hazards in Saskatchewan. Moreover, effort is also being made to crowdsource

information collection on public health hazards – the Honduras Health Mapping project tracks rabies

and cholera outbreaks in Honduras. Crowdsourcing has also been used in crop management – the Kenya
office of the UN Office of Coordination for Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has used crowdsourcing to

collect information from farmers on poisonous blight on a particular crop and then sending forward the

information to other farmers, a move called reverse crowdsourcing.

        An interesting aspect of crowdsourcing before a disaster takes place is that it shifts the emphasis

of information collection to phenomena related to s low-onset and acute crises, phenomena which are

easier to report on because of the lack of pressure to all actors typically found during a rapid-onset
                                                                                                   42
crisis. So far, the examples above pertain to natural hazards that take place mostly over extended

periods of time. Nevertheless, crowdsourcing has also been usedto track man-made and societal crises.
NiJel, for example, is an institution that makes use of crowdsourcing through its HarassMap platform to

track harassment cases that take place in Cairo.

        Moreover, at the time of this writing, initiatives are being planned by some of the institutions

contacted in bringing this type of activity further, recognizing the fact that there are phenomena which

could exacerbate existing crises. One area is climate change – talks are under way between the UN

Population Fund (UNFPA) and NiJel on how to make use of crowdsourcing to capture reports from the

public on climatic changes.

3.6.3 Critical Infrastructure Information

        Information about infrastructure – especially the locations of hospitals, emergency centers,

government buildings, etc. – as pointed out in the previous section, form one key ingredient in

preparedness efforts. In situations where such information is missing, crowdsourcing has the ability to

fill missing information, particularly in the form of cartographic data.

        The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, for example, is an organization that works with

national governments and other organizations in providing training in the OpenStreetMap technology.

One of its latest projects was in the area of data preparedness in the city of Jakarta, Indonesia. In

response to the need for base data (i.e. geographic information on human settlements, important

buildings), the goal of the project was to produce such previously unavailable data. It made use of
volunteers (i.e. high school students incentivized t hrough a contest) trained in using GPS.  76While the

final product, an open-source map of Indonesia, would be useful for everybody, it comes especially with

humanitarian response in mind – in particular, the data that was produced has been used in modeling

the effects of risks and hazards to infrastructure.

        In the same way, the Honduras Health Mapping project, set out to map the existing health care

infrastructure in Honduras, which had previously only existed in telephone direct ories without

specifying exact addresses. The crowdsourcing effort was achieved through the geolocation of such

infrastructure either by grabbing location information from existing resources (e.g. documents from

3.7 What are the origins of using crowdsourcing for dis aster preparedness?

        Several conditions present in the current state ofaffairs have become pretexts for the creation

of the initiatives described above.

3.7.1 Proactive inclinations to the use of crowdsourcing

        As discussed before, crowdsourcing for disaster management has remained primarily a reactive

activity. All the institutions examined share a proactive stance towards the use of crowdsourcing, noting

that crowdsourcing could be used extensively as a way to reduce the likelihoods of disasters taking
place. Interestingly, the institutions contacted have expressed their motivations in the form of questions

under which their activities were built upon – the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team asks the question

of “Could we map ahead of time?”, the Honduras Health Mapping project declares its motivation

through the slogan of “Why wait for the next crisis?”, while NiJel asks the question of “How can we use

technology to tell the story of a social problem?”.

3.7.2 Lack of available information resources

        Similar to past crowdsourcing efforts, the gaps that the institutions were trying to fill were

mainly due to the scarcity of information in current available resources. The mapping of Jakarta by the
Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team was caused by the lack of available geographic data on critical

infrastructure. Similarly, the scarcity of location information for Honduran health care infrastructure –

which has spawned the impression amongst humanitarian actors that a national healthcare system itself

was inexistent– led to the creation ofthe Honduras Health Mapping project.

3.7.3 Inefficiency of methods for information collection/dissemination

        Several institutions have expressed their concern over current methods of information

collection and dissemination. The Kenya office of UN OCHA expresses that, in managing crop

infestations, any efforts could be rendered useless because of the long time it would take for farmers to
travel to centers to report incidents of infestation. Likewise, the risk to not inform concerned people at

the right time is high because 1) current methods are slow(e.g. putting up posters) 2) television access

and penetration is not wide and 3) radio broadcasts may not reach the right people because of language

problems. As opposed to this, crowdsourcing – and pushing back crowdsourced information to people –

was considered efficient in that the messages were customizable in terms of content, audience and
language.




                                                                                                     47
        Similarly, inefficiency in terms of producing maps was also experienced in Jakarta in that official

maps were 1) expensive to produce and may not reach a level of detail that disaster responders could

work with and 2) took a long release cycle. Crowdsourcing offered a means to provide quick and

detailed geographic data.

3.7.4 Availability of technology

        Perhaps in adopting technological tools for the purposes of preparedness, their wide availability

is the simplest factor. On one hand, the infrastructure for crowdsourcing and crisis mapping – Ushahidi

and OpenStreetMap – has firmly been established for some time and takes very little effort to set up. On
the other hand, the tools to communicate and report information – such as cellular phones and the

internet – are widely available and cheap to use.

3.8 What are the functions of crowdsourcing for disaste r preparedness?


        As a communications tool, pre-crisis crowdsourcing presents several functions that distinguish

its role for preparedness from those usually represented in disaster response. The following can be
considered as crowdsourcing’s roles for disaster preparedness:

3.8.1 Means of providing critically lacking information/presenting preparedness-related

information


        By nature, crowdsourcing for disaster preparedness is anticipatory. The information produced
before a disaster takes place relies upon the identification by those who request for information (the

crowdsourcers) of what through their work they deemed important to avert a disaster or information

necessary for managing disasters but was otherwise scarce to find. The need to produce functional maps

for places where they didn’t exist or existed in in adequate form (such as those in Indonesia or Hondur as

which lack location information on critical infrastructure) reminds us of efforts in Haiti to map
emergency and geographic information, only this time mapping was done prior to a disaster has

produced demanding conditions. Moreover, whereas be fore hazards have mostly been studied by

experts and institutions with specialized technologies, crowdsourcing has the capability of

complementing the identification of hazards from those who experience it first-hand.

        Interestingly, with crowdsourcing being a means of capturing specific and defined information, it

is important to note that types of information coll ected arise and become in need depending on the
situation at hand. Several of the institutions contacted spoke of the repurposing of crowdsourcing

platforms, that is to say the addition of several other information types to what was originally being


                                                                                                    48
collected – the Honduras Health Mapping project, for example, has included cholera and rabies

outbreaks as important collected information categories after the original purpose of mapping health

care infrastructure, whereas NiJel has been used extensively to provide advocacy infor mation during the

Arab Spring. On one hand, this phenomenon points to the importan ce of non-rigidity in crowdsourcing

projects. On the other hand, it also points out tha t present pace and extent to which information is
collected for humanitarian purposes is still inadequate.

3.8.2 Complement to existing preparedness information


        Crowdsourced information has the capacity to comple ment existing preparedness information
in the form of official reports produced by governments, NGOs, and international organizations.

Especially for institutions that make use of multiple sources of information for preparedness,

crowdsourcing helps in the production of knowledge through providing additional information in the

analysis of different situations – the Kenya office of UN OCHA for example uses crowdsourced

information to have an idea of the extent to which a known poisonous blight has spread apart from
what official sources have identified. Crowdsourced information can also be used to identify interesting

relationships in phenomena taking place – for example, through the identification of the growth of

rabies outbreaks in certain cities in Honduras, the owner of the Honduras Health Mapping project

examined its cause and found a link to the unavailability of rabies vaccinations in such areas.

        In the same way, crowdsourced information may not always exist as independent sources of

information. Information has to be aggregated/consolidated in a logical and holistic way so that it would
make sense. Some institutions package crowdsourced information with satellite imagery to gain a

clearer picture of hazards that are taking shape, while others have established websites related linked to

crowdsourcing efforts that feature expert research on preparedness measures.

3.8.3 Source of situational awareness for slow-onset disasters

        As opposed to the disaster response phase, which wo uld naturally show the quick and abrupt

growth of a disaster, crowdsourcing for disaster preparedness has the chance to show in a gradual way

the growth of a phenomenon. Situational awareness is produced as a function of the perceived sca le of

a phenomenon. This makes crowdsourcing ideal in keeping track of the progress and mitigation of slow-

onset phenomena such as droughts (and a host of oth er phenomena related to climate change) and
chronic crises such as poverty and hunger.

        This feature of crowdsourcing also enables it to become a viable tool for early action and

advocacy. As expressed by JD Godchaux, executive di rector of NiJel, through the visualization of

                                                                                                    49
crowdsourced information, “you get to a scale of reports on the map that [the issue athand] becomes

an undeniable problem.” Appropriate action – such as grassroots organization – can then be built

around the situation.

3.8.4 Tool for early coordination/creation of social networks among humanitarian actors

        What takes place behind crowdsourcing activities are the efforts of individuals who not only

facilitate and maintain the infrastructure that makes crowdsourcing possible but, increasingly, create a

broader network of individuals and institutions seeing the use of crowdsourcing for disaster

management in a more proactive manner. Crowdsourcing has become a viable coordination tool
especially in pre-crisis or post-crisis situations, when there is a much bigger chance of reaching “last

mile” vulnerable groups of people, those who are most inaccessible due to physical distance or simply

because of lack of knowledge of their needs. As expressed by Paul B. Jones, creator of the Honduras

Health Mapping project, crowdsourcing enables such missing informa tion about vulnerable groups to be

identified so that humanitarian actors could ideally coordinate their efforts by knowing which
communities to serve first and not replicate efforts or waste resources.

        Social networks amongst humanitarian actors could also be strengthened as an externality.

Already, as mentioned before, networks such as the International Network of Crisis Mappers or the

online community of Ushahidi have already been esta blished. As some interviewees have conveyed,

such networks built prior to a disaster taking place are important in that they become active channels in

spreading information at the run-up and duration of a disaster.

3.9 What is the experience with using volunteers in crowdsourcing for disaster

preparedness?

        The initiatives discussed would not have existed withou t the help and effort of volunteers who

submit information. The experience with using volun teers prior to a disaster taking place has been muc h

like the experience of using volunteers during a disaster setting in that they assume the same roles and

motivations. Nevertheless, as the primary source of crowdsourced information, it would useful to take

dedicate the following section to specifying their backgrounds and motivations in order to understand
their contributions to preparedness.

3.9.1 Volunteer profiles


        The volunteers who participated in the initiatives discussed do not share a common background.
On the other hand, their participation depended on the situation that necessitated their participation.


                                                                                                    50
To illustrate, information coming from farmers were used by the Kenyan office of UN OCHA because

they constituted the group who had the background n ecessary to identify the crop infestation that UN

OCHA was trying to eradicate.

        At the same time, this is not to say that volunteers needed to come from a specific background

so that they could contribute information. The ability to train volunteers, an opportunity afforded only

during the pre-disaster phase, for example, is exercised by the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team to
train complete amateurs (i.e. students) to use mapp ing tools such as GPS.

        The following, in a nutshell, are the kinds of volunteers, apart from the public at large, that the

institutions examined made use of:

    •   Farmers

    •   Students

    •   Doctors

    •   GIS enthusiasts

    •   NGO and international organization staff

        In terms of motivation, the bulk of volunteers were motivated to share information or
participate in mapping efforts for altruistic reasons, either because of the wish to proactively avert

disasters or because of a greater desire to do good. Some were incentivized to join in efforts through

contests with prizes (i.e. students). Others joined efforts because their livelihoods depended on the

information they passed along (i.e. farmers).

3.10 Conclusions

        The possibilities inherent in crowdsourcing as a method of information collection have brought

about innovative ways of utilizing it, as in the case for disaster preparedness. Just as there are

information gaps at the onset of and during a disaster, the need to obtain reliable and accurate

information extends even before a disaster takes place.In the same vein that crowdsourcing has existed

to provide new or complementary information on what is lacking during a disaster, a number of new
initiatives exist to provide similar information before a disaster takes place. This proactive approach,

enabled by the necessity but also by the accessibility of current forms of ICTs, has produced remarkable

results.

CHAPTER 4 Impacts, Challenges and Opportunities



4.1 Introduction

        The purpose of this chapter is to provide an idea of the various impacts and issues experienced

in crowdsourcing for disaster preparedness. Moreover, it also provides several key point and ideas

related to how crowdsourcing can be improved to be a better tool for disaster preparedness.

4.2 Impacts of crowdsourcing for disaster preparedness


4.2.1 Contributions to Resilience

        Resilience is an integral part of disaster risk reduction. Crowdsourcing has the potential to help

building the capacity of vulnerable groups to be resilient by making themselves aware or inform

themselves of the various surrounding risks and hazards, and in so doing be able to organize the proper

formal and informal interventions.

        As explained by JD Godchaux, executive director of NiJel, crowdsourcing can be used as a way to

build resilience in that it has a way of capturing the way a phenomenon progresses, which may

otherwise have gone unnoticed. As he explains:

        “We think that these long-standing social problems… if they’re dealt with prior to a crisis
        happening, those things can build a resiliency amongst the people that wouldn’t have existed

        otherwise… [You] can think of it much more strongly when you think about mitigating poverty or
        mitigating the risk of somebody living in a low-lying area for flood hazard or something like
        that…” 77



        He goes on to explain that crowdsourcing ultimately contributes to the creation of collective

awareness:

        “Our [crowdsourcing] projects provide an outlet and an avenue for advocacy around the issues. It
        helps people who volunteer – to know that they’re not alone, that they’re part of a much larger
        problem in society than what they experienced that day.”  78

4.2.2 Advantages of pre-disaster crowdsourcing


        Pre-disaster crowdsourcing poses several advantages over crowdsourcing after a disaster has
already taken place or over other communications tools.

        Early preparation of data means it is already present and ready for use – Humanitarian actors

have more access to information essential for response.

        Crowdsourcing provides a more complete picture of what’s happening on the ground – Even

when official information sources abound, volunteered information can sometimes provide a different

idea of what is taking place. One of the institutions contacted felt that crowdsourced information cou ld

sometimes pit independent organizations against states because crowdsourcing exposes disparities that
official sources might try to hide. Moreover, crowdsourcing offers a great chance to present traditional

knowledge.

        Cheap, low barriers to entry, huge support community – Since the tools used for crowdsourcing

largely remain under free licenses, they are easier to acquire more than most other communication

tools for disaster management. They are likewise easy to set up and is backed by a huge support

community comprised of users, administrators and application developers.

        Crowdsourcing platforms are flexible tools – Crowdsourcing platforms, as discussed before,
could be repurposed, especially at the peak of a disaster, to provide information different from the ones

originally intended. As a rule of thumb, then, preparing crowdsourcing platforms before a disaster

strikes, no matter how efficient or not it turns out to be, is still better than having nothing.

4.2.3 Benefits of volunteer support for pre-disaster crowdsourcing

        In the experience of the institutions examined, the use of volunteers as sources of

crowdsourced information offer several benefits, especially as a potentially abundant resource before a

disaster takes place.

        Volunteers are limitless sources of information – As opposed to the common expectation that

the group that comprises volunteers is only considered to be a beneficiary of humanitarian action, it is
important to note that they could on the contrary be a relevant information source of information from

the “front lines.” Otherwise being overlooked, the institutions examined are surprised of how much

information some volunteers have or are able to produce.

        Volunteers are usually trustworthy – There is often little need to verify the information

volunteers submit once an initial screening is done to the volunteer to determine their quality of work


                                                                                                     53
and once an administrator of the crowdsourcing platform has an idea of what kinds of information they

submit. An added benefit is that, by already knowin g which volunteer to trust, less verification is ne eded

when activities are shifted to the disaster response phase.

        Volunteers are more efficient to work with before a disaster – the pool of volunteers gathered

before a disaster takes place offers the distinct advantage that they are “primed” to work with. Taking

advantage of the non-stressful situation, volunteers are at a better state of mind and are able to be
trained more efficiently with regards to standards and practices.


4.3 Challenges

4.3.1 Data Quality

        Data quality of crowdsourced information remains an issue for pre-disaster crowdsourcing. This

could point to the relevance of data received. Even though volunteers are trustworthy as has oftenbeen

the case, from time to time, unwanted information is still received from those with malicious and

politically motivated intent.

        At the same time, the issue could also point towards theefforts to verify received information.
This is especially apparent in crisis mapping, where the time and effort to verify volunteer produced

information could be as much time and effort as if the institution had done the mapping itself. Thus

there is a need for better tools or processes to verify information.

4.3.2 Sustainability of Volunteer Efforts

        Since most of crowdsourcing is built around volunta ry networks and contributions, the issue of

sustainability is likely to arise. This issue is felt by some institutions more than others – the Honduras

Health Mapping project, for example, has been on hiatus for more than a year due to the other

commitments of both its creator, who is still completing training to be a medical professional, and the
few volunteers with whom the project has been pursu ed.

        Volunteers have obligations to fulfill outside their crowdsourcing activities, be they their primary

jobs or having to spend time with family. There is a need to manage the commitment of volunteers –

which entails giving them just the right amount of things to accomplish – especially those who do more

than just submit information.

        Another important issue is how to keep volunteers motivated in the long run – volunteers are

often easy to come by but they are hard to keep. Sincevolunteers participate with some kind of reward
in mind, the right incentives need to be put in pla ce so that they keep on being interested in


                                                                                                      54
volunteering. This can take several forms such as providing visibility on how they are helping or offering

opportunities for further learning.

4.3.3 What to donext?

        After the crowdsourcing platform has been put in pl ace and is deemed to be functional in that

crowdsourced information is being received, the looming question that institutions have is: what do we

do with the information? This is primarily a question of design. The issue is that, even though a

crowdsourcing platform exists, the responses it triggers do not always exist. As expressed by Jeanine

Cooper, a disaster manager who used to work with the Kenya office of UN OCHA, “yes, we have the
information but what do we do with it? Will it be turned into a monthly report? Will it be turned into

instant ambulance action… The system needs to be designed and understood by all players.”

4.4 Opportunities for improvements in crowdsourcing for disaster preparedness


        This question of “what to do next?” opens up the di scussion of the various ways in which

crowdsourcing can be used better for disaster preparedness.

4.4.1 Institutionalization of crowdsourcing for disasterpreparedness

        A sentiment shared by many who make use of crowdsourcing is that one of the barriers that

keeps its full potential from being fully realized is the lack of acceptance in more institutionalized
settings. There is an agreement among those who make use of crowdsourcing that it is a viable and

strong tool for the purposes of information collection and that most of the tools that could make it work

already exist. However, the organizations that currentlymake use of crowdsourcing do so thanks to the

pushing of individuals who have confidence in it. The hard part is to mainstream crowdsourcing as a

standard tool that organizations such as the UN, NGOs, and all levels of a state – local, regional and
national authorities – could work with.

4.4.2 Citizen organization for preparedness crowdsourcing


        As one of the interviews summed it up – the technology is the easy part. Getting the societal
process which crowdsourcing is built upon to sustai n itself is the challenging part. As discussed abov e,

volunteer sustainability is a key issue. More creative ways to keeping and recruitment is thus needed. As

most of the institutions contacted have expressed, the impetus to volunteer for crowdsourcing efforts

during the disaster response phase is evidently easy to achieve. For the greater disaster risk reduction

phase, the central challenge is to keep volunteers interested in contributing to crowdsourcing efforts.



                                                                                                     55
4.4.3 Opening two-way communication channels


        Crowdsourcing is mostly used at this point as a one -way communication channel in that
information is received from and ends with those coming from volunteers. Of course, as we have seen,

there are some efforts such as that done by the Kenya office of UN OCHA to transform information flows

by making crowdsourcing a two-way communication channel by giving back the inform ation that is

received.

        Nevertheless, the efforts to make crowdsourcing a toolfor two-way communications still have a

lot of room for growth. Substantial progress can be made in terms of how crowdsourced information
can be repackaged and presented in a way that complements official information.

        Moreover, progress can also be made in terms of making use of crowdsourcing as tool to

automatically trigger certain actions. This can become useful especially for coordination purposes. As

envisioned by Moira Fratta, a preparedness planner for UNICEF in South East Asia, crowdsourcing can be

used to not only receive information but also to know where to find resources – such as human,

technical, and financial resources (the latter growing to be a phenomenon known as crowdfunding) –
and coordinate preparedness efforts – such as the construction or repair of preparedness-critical

infrastructure.

4.5 Conclusions


        The pre-disaster phase presents several advantages for disaster preparedness crowdsourcing in

terms of ability to achieve data preparedness, management and creation of social networks amongst
volunteers, and the wider societal contributions to resilience. Still several challenges are present and can

remind us of the more general issues in disaster management. The sustainability of pre-disaster

crowdsourcing efforts, for one, seems to be an issue that most institutions have to face. Just as disaster

response has usually been the recipient of more resources than preparedness due to increased public

attention, pre-disaster crowdsourcing seems like it could make use of more resources to maximize its
potentials. Moreover, just as in disaster preparedness in general a preparedness plan may remain as

nothing but a plan, there is a possibility that pre-disaster crowdsourcing may remain as merely but a tool

for producing potentially unusable and impractical information. There is thus a need to follow up on

what crowdsourcing can do with real action.






                                                                                                    56
Conclusions


        This research set out to find out the role that crowdsourcing entails for disaster preparedness.
As an important stage in disaster risk reduction, disaster preparedness encompasses activities aimed to

anticipate disaster scenarios and prime efforts for disaster response. Technologies in general form an

integral part in the system that comprises preparedness efforts in order to provide information on

necessary response resources as well as on the different hazards to which groups of people are

vulnerable.

        Likewise, crowdsourcing functions as a source of potentially limitless and valuable volunteer-
produced information useful for preparedness effort s. Crowdsourcing enhances the current information

infrastructure by providing supplementary and, more often, new information on what is commonly

scarce information that preparedness efforts would have great use for – particularly information on

hazards and critical infrastructure resources. In truth, such information does not differ much from what

crowdsourcing during disaster response has to offer. However, the fact that crowdsourcing could be
done proactively makes a lot of difference in the s ense that crowdsourcing could be produced in a

fashion that makes use of time and other resources more sensibly and have far reaching impacts to the

resilience of vulnerable groups with the potentials crowdsourcing has for communities to inform and

organize themselves on issues that require early action.

        From a development perspective, crowdsourcing for disaster preparedness establishes several

opportunities that can be built upon further. As a method of info rmation collection that does not
require a huge amount of capital investment, crowdsourcing can become a catalyst and reinforcement

for current and future projects that authorities would like to pursue. The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap

Team’s project in Indonesia is a strong case in point – the realization that pre-crisis mapping using

volunteer information could also be a possible means to pursue a more specialized goal of risk modeling

makes one think of the multiple and complex uses of crowdsourced information.

        Likewise, the possibilities derived from crowdsourcing exist for the greater public.
Crowdsourcing exists in the first place because there is enough public interest to bring up and have an

idea to which extent an important issue or cause is taking place. The potentials crowdsourcing brings to

highlight what is crucial before a disaster takes place in effect places the agenda of local populations to

the fore. Crowdsourcing’s potentials are only limited by the creativity and willingness of the public to

partake in it.


                                                                                                      57
        Crowdsourcing for disaster preparedness is still very much in its early stages. The initiatives

described in this research do not form an exhaustive representation of all the current efforts and those

still being developed, and perhaps this research has not described the full possibilities inherent in using

crowdsourcing as a preparedness tool. Meanwhile, a host of challenges also remain but with it also

opportunities for further improvement. The ideal scenario, which can be achieved through institutional

backing, is to find crowdsourcing as a standard method of information collection integrated with current
standard preparedness tools and processes.

        This research has just scratched the surface of this recent crowdsourcing phenomenon. Since

this research has primarily been done through the perspective of institutions that have established and

used crowdsourcing for their own purposes, a possible next step for this research is to analyze the

phenomenon from a user-centric perspective. This approach would not only offer a deeper look into

user/volunteer motivations to take part in crowdsourcing efforts before a disaster takes place but also

have implications as to how to optimize crowdsourcing for disaster preparedness.
