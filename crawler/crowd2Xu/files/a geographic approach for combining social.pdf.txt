         In recent years, social media emerged as a potential resource to improve the

         management of crisis situations such as disasters triggered by natural hazards.

         Although there is a growing research body concerned with the analysis of the

         usage of social media during disasters, most previous work has concentrated on

         using social media as a standalone information source, whereas its combination

         with other information sources holds a still underexplored potential. This paper

         presents an approach to enhance the identification of relevant messages from

         social media that relies upon the relations between georeferenced social media

         messages as Volunteered Geographic Information , and geographic features of

         flood phenomena as derived from authoritative data (sensor data, hydrological

         data and digital elevation models ). We apply this approach to examine the micro-

         blogging text messages of the Twitter platform (tweets) produced during the

         River Elbe Flood of June 2013 in Germany. This is performed by means of a

         statistical analysis aimed at identifying general spatial patterns in the occurrence

         of flood-related tweets that may be associated with proximity to and severity of

         flood events. The results show that messages near (up to 10 km) to severely

         flooded areas have a much higher probability of being related to floods. In this

         manner, we conclude that the geographic approach proposed here        provides a

         reliable quantitative indicator of the usefulness of messages from social media by

         leveraging existing knowledge about natural hazards such as floods, thus being

         valuable for disaster management in both crisis response and preventive

         monitoring.

1 Introduction

        In different catastrophic events of the past few years – from Southern California

wildfires in 2007 to the 2010 Haiti earthquake and typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines in

2013 – social media have enabled the affected population to timely publicize an


overwhelming amount of disaster-related information (Goodchild and Glennon 2010,

Vieweg et al. 2010, Zook et al. 2010, Yates and Paquette 2011, Kaewkitipong et al.

2012, Chatfield and Brajawidagda 2013).


        Since disasters are generally characterized by high levels of information need

and low levels of information availability (Shklovski et al. 2010), it seems intuitive to

consider social media as an additional information source for coping with crises. Of


particular interest here are social media messages that carry a geographic reference,

which can be considered Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) (Goodchild 2007,


Sui and Goodchild 2011), since they can be used for composing a picture of what is

happening in a specific place. The growing adoption of electronic devices equipped

with GPS (e.g. smartphones and tablets) in the past few years has made an increasing


the amount of geoinformation available in social media platforms and thereby

transformed them into location-based social networks (Roick and Heuser 2013).

However, due to the sheer volume, high velocity and varied structure of social media


content, one significant challenge that arises in this context is how to deal with this ‘big

data’ to separate the wheat from the chaff, i.e. how to pick up the relevant pieces of

information out of the deluge of, mostly irrelevant, social media messages.


        In the past few years, the problem of analyzing information produced via social

media in the context of crises has been addressed by a growing body of literature (see


Landwehr and Carley (2014) for a survey). Most of the research performed in this field

approaches the problem of seeking to detect patterns and extract information by looking

exclusively at data from social media, i.e. using social media as a standalone

information source. However, in many crises situations triggered by natural hazards,

data from other information sources (e.g. in situ sensors, space-borne data from


satellites, existing authoritative geographic data) are available which could profitably be

leveraged upon in order to make the analysis of social media more effective.

        Building upon this motivation and based our previous work (Herfort et al.


2014a, 2014b), a geographic approach is proposed in this paper to leverage existing

geographic knowledge related to natural hazards (such as floods) for the analysis of

georeferenced social media messages (i.e. VGI). This paper complements and


substantially extends our previous studies (Herfort et al. 2014a, 2014b) by adding: (a) a

more comprehensive and general account of the proposed geographic approach for


combining social media and authoritative data with the goal of identifying the most

useful messages for disaster management; (b) an improved data basis of the case

analyzed, which includes a more rigorous classification of messages of the Twitter


platform during the 2013 floods of the river Elbe in Germany, as well as a more

comprehensive dataset of in situ water level sensor measurements; (c) robust statistical

methods based on a generalized additive model to provide compelling quantitative


evidence of the association between the relevance of social media messages with

proximity to and severity of flood events; (d) a discussion of the results in comparison

to extant work on the subject.


        The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the

background for the current work by reviewing the extant research on the analysis of


social media for disaster management. Section 3 explains our approach, whilst Section 4

describes the case study to which the approach is applied together with the data sources

used. Section 5 describes the methodology employed. Section 6 then presents the results

of this study, whereas Section 7 discusses the results and makes suggestions for future

work. Section 8 casts some conclusions.



2 Background: Social Media Analysis for Disaster Management

        In the past few years, an increasing number of studies have examined the use of

social media data for gaining knowledge about areas of human activity that are as


diverse as detecting disease surveillance for detecting epidemic outbreaks (Gomide et

al. 2011, Bernardo et al. 2013) and predicting the stock market (Bollen et al. 2011).

        In the particular field of disaster management, a large part of existing research


focused on the analysis of short messages of the Twitter platform, so-called tweets.

Sakaki et al. (2010) and Crooks et al. (2013) investigated the use of Twitter for

detecting and estimating the trajectory of earthquakes in real-time. De Longueville et al.


(2010) proposed the use of VGI as a sensor for detecting forest fire hotspots, based on

previous work that analyzed the application of Twitter as a source of spatiotemporal

information for wildfire events in France. In contrast, Fuchs et al. (2013) showed that


event detection based on peaks of Twitter activity did not work for the 2013 floods in

Germany, and presented an analysis of spatiotemporal clusters. Bakillah et al. (2014)


applied graph clustering to support the detection of geo-located communities in Twitter

after the typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines. Furthermore, a number of studies are

concerned about developing tools for visualizing social media data in order to enable


make-sensing and location-based knowledge discovery (MacEachren et al. 2011,

Terpstra and Vries 2012, Croitoru et al. 2013, Spinsanti and Ostermann 2013).

        Another group of studies seek to identify useful information from social media


that could be valuable for improving situation awareness (Yin et al. 2012), i.e. for

improving “the perception of elements in the environment within a volume of time and

space, the comprehension of their meaning, and the projection of their status in the near

future” (Endsley 1995). Vieweg et al. (2010) and Starbird et al. (2010) analyzed Twitter

messages during the flooding of the Red River Valley in the US and Canada in 2009

seeking to discern activity patterns and extract useful information. Acar and Muraki


(2011) applied open-ended questionnaires to selected Twitter users and also analyzed

the tweets sent in response to the Tohoku earthquake and the consequent tsunami in

Japan, 2011. Starbird and Muzny (2012) resorted to machine learning to identify


messages from Twitter users who were likely to be ‘on the ground’ during a crisis

event. Imran et al. (2013) employed machine learning for successfully extracting

structured information from unstructured, text-based Twitter messages and compared


their results with manual classification based on crowdsourcing.

        These previous analyses on social media usage in disasters identified a distinct


role of users local to the event (or “on the ground”), who are more probable to generate

useful information for improving situational awareness (Starbird et al. 2010, Vieweg et

al. 2010, Acar and Muraki 2011, Bruns et al. 2012, Dugdale et al. 2012, Starbird and


Muzny 2012, Imran et al. 2013). For instance, Acar and Muraki (2011) found that

people in directly affected areas tend to tweet about their unsafe situation and survival

related topics, while people in remote areas post messages about secondary effects (e.g.


transportation) and for informing others that they are safe. As pointed out by Starbird &

Muzny (2012, p. 2), “people who are on the ground are uniquely positioned to share

information that may not yet be available elsewhere in the information space”. These


works usually perform a binary classification of the messages into local/non-local, by

resorting to a hand-analysis of the addresses provided in the user profiles (Starbird et al.


2010, Vieweg et al. 2010, Acar and Muraki 2011) or using machine learning algorithms

based on the content of messages to classify messages as “on the ground” (Starbird and

Muzny 2012) or as coming from an “eyewitness” (Imran et al. 2013) that may provide

“first-hand” observations (Landwehr and Carley 2014). However, these studies do not

provide compelling statistical evidence on the correlation between the

semantics/usefulness of social media messages and their distance to areas affected by


disasters.

        As for quantitative spatiotemporal analyses, most of the existing work in the

area has sought to make sense of social media data as a standalone source by analyzing


aggregated patterns, e.g. by defining thresholds for the size of spatiotemporal clusters of

messages that would serve as signals for crisis events of earthquakes (Sakaki et al.

2010, Crooks et al. 2013), wildfires (De Longueville et al. 2010, Slavkovikj et al. 2014)


or disease surveillance (Gomide et al. 2011, Bernardo et al. 2013). However, with such

an approach the actual content of social media messages is largely ignored and with


this, much of their potential to improve current knowledge about the unfolding situation

is lost. Furthermore, although event detection is useful for sudden-onset crises for which

there do not exist any other related data, in many concrete cases there are additional


information sources available. As pointed out by Lazer et al. (2014), one should not see

‘big data’ as a substitute for all existing data, but rather take the challenge of doing

innovative analytics by using data from all traditional and new sources.


        This is in line with a nascent research stream that uses VGI in combination with

other geodata sources in the field of disaster management (Spinsanti and Ostermann

2013, Triglav-Čekada and Radovan 2013, Schnebele et al. 2014, Tomaszewski et al.


2014). Within this group, Spinsanti and Ostermann (2013) and Tomaszewski et al.

(2013) are the only studies that we found to use external data about the geographic


context to analyze social media data. Tomaszewski et al. (2014) present a work-in-

progress aimed at retrieving authoritative data related to the contents of a message from

Twitter for providing visual context, without further integrating the two datasets.

Spinsanti and Ostermann (2013) used external datasets to enrich social media, achieving

good results in detecting spatiotemporal clusters of social media messages about forest

fires. However, they do not use data streams from official sensors, but resort to more


static information such as population density and ratio of forest cover. Furthermore,

none of these studies was able to perform statistical analyses of the geographical

relations between social media and authoritative data.



3 Research Approach


This paper addresses the problem of identifying useful information from VGI, in

particular georeferenced social media, for improving situation awareness during


emergencies. In contrast to most approaches reviewed in the previous section, which try

to leverage VGI as a standalone information source, our approach explores external data


sources to establish geographical relations between flood phenomena and social media

messages. The basic idea of our approach follows from the observation that in practical

settings there is usually some information available about the natural phenomena that


trigger a disaster. Thus, we propose that the existing information basis could be

exploited when seeking to identify relevant additional information contained in social

media messages.



        Floods, in particular, are phenomena which are closely spatially correlated to

geographical features of water streams. Existing geographical information about

affected river basins and watersheds can thus be profitably used in this context.


Furthermore, in many practical cases additional information sources are available in

(near) real time, such as in situ sensors of river gauging stations and/or airborne


observations from satellites. This information can be used to determine the

spatiotemporal characteristics of the flood phenomena being analyzed. Therefore, in the

Information Science, available online: http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/136 58816.2014.996567 . Please refer
to the published version for referencing.

case of floods, it makes less sense to use georeferenced social media to do event

detection, as has been previously done for earthquakes (Sakaki et al. 2010, Crooks et al.

2013).



        Furthermore, spatiotemporal characteristics of the floods affect the

spatiotemporal characteristics of VGI and social media messages. As previously

mentioned, existing studies have shown that social media messages coming from people


local to the events should contain more useful information (Acar and Muraki 2011,

Bruns et al. 2012, Dugdale et al. 2012, Starbird and Muzny 2012, Imran et al. 2013,


Landwehr and Carley 2014). Based on this, the hypothesis posed here is that social

media messages which are closer to the flooded areas are more likely relevant and/or

more strongly related to the unfolding event, thus being more useful for improving


situation awareness. Our approach thus explores the relations between spatial

information from social media messages and geographic information about flood

phenomena both from hydrological data and official sensor data. The goal is to test our


hypothesis that the proximity to and severity of observed flood phenomena can be a

significant resource to identify useful messages with the goal of improving situation

awareness, thus supporting disaster management.


        (Figure 1) schematically depicts our approach, which is divided into three main

components:

1) Gathering information on flood phenomena, i.e. identifying flood-affected regions;


2) Gathering information from social media, i.e. georeferenced Twitter messages;

3) Analyzing the geographical relations between the information on flood phenomena


(1) and social media messages (2) to assess the usefulness of social media messages.

        In this manner, our approach seeks to leverage existing knowledge and data

about the spatiotemporal characteristics of flood phenomena in order to improve the

identification of useful information from georeferenced social media. It is thus


consistent with the suggestion of Gao et al. (2011) that scientific data could be used to

augment user-generated data so as to provide more detailed insights on information

requirements and needs during a disaster.


        In this paper, this approach is applied to analyze the use of Twitter during the

River Elbe flood in 2013, as described in the next sections.



4 Description of the case study and datasets


This section provides a description of our case study followed by an explanation of the

datasets we employed.



4.1 River Elbe Flood


In the period from 30 May to 3 June 2013 extreme heavy rain affected large parts of


eastern and central Europe. According to the State Agency for Environment,
This is an Accepted Manuscript of an article published in International Journal of Geographical
Information Science, available online: http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/136 58816.2014.996567 . Please refer

Agriculture and Geology of Saxony (Sächsisches Landesamt für Umwelt

Landwirtschaft und Geologie 2013), the distribution of precipitation in the basin of the

rivers Elbe and its tributaries Moldau and Saale reached values two to three times as


high as the average month of June, which is equivalent to a centennial return period.

The soil was already highly saturated at this time due to precipitations in May 2013.

Therefore, the heavy rain rapidly resulted in surface runoff causing the severe flood


situation.

        Some gauging stations measured values that were never recorded before. For

instance, at “Magdeburg-Strombrücke” the water level reached 7.46 m, which is more


than 70 cm higher than the former maximum. Another characteristic of the flood was

the huge stretch of the flood wave. The alert phase 4 (the highest in Germany) that was


announced by the government lasted for 6 days along the rivers Elbe, Mulde, Elster and

Neiße in Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt (Sächsisches Landesamt für Umwelt

Landwirtschaft und Geologie 2013).



4.2 Datasets


Twitter Data


The Twitter dataset contains of 60,524 geo-referenced short text messages (“tweets”)


within the territory of Germany. Each message consists of up to 140 Unicode

characters. Besides the text message, every tweet contains several metadata fields, such

as a timestamp (UTC time) when the tweet was created, hashtags (i.e. keywords


preceded by #), URLs, an integer unique ID of the tweet, and information about the user

who posted the tweet. The geographic location of a tweet is described in the metadata


field “coordinates”, which is also known as geotag. The inner coordinates array is

formatted as geoJSON.    1


        Users can geo-reference messages in Twitter in different ways: either manually

(e.g. by entering the name of a city in the field “location”) or automatically when a

client application has access to the coordinates of a GPS receiver. Unfortunately, only a


small fraction of tweets are currently georeferenced by users. A recent study found that

the prevalence of geolocated tweets was only about 3%; however, city and state could


be determined for 17% of user profiles using a simple text-matching approach, with a

high agreement (88%) between GPS data and text-matching in the United States


(Burton et al. 2012). Another study estimates that 11-13% of the tweets in Europe and

1% in Germany are geolocated (Fuchs et al. 2013). While this may limit analyses based


on the geolocation such as the current study, the absolute number of geotagged tweets is

actually high, since the size of the overall data set tends to be large. Furthermore,


availability of georeferenced social media messages can be expected to increase in the

next years with the widespread adoption of GPS-enabled devices.


        Twitter offers a number of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which

can be used for automatically retrieving data. For this study, we used the Twitter


streaming API, which provides access to a 1% sample of the real-time stream of total

tweets sampled by taking every 100 tweet (Burton et al. 2012). The data was collected


by querying the streaming API during the period from 08 June 2013 1:30 pm to 10 June

2013 midnight for georeferenced tweets within a bounding box covering Germany.


Afterwards we further filtered tweets by their location and excluded those outside the

territory of Germany.

Authoritative data

        As authoritative data about the flood phenomena, we gathered official water


level data from 185 monitoring stations along the German federal waterways provided

by the German Federal Waterways and Shipping Administration and the German


Federal Institute for Hydrology. The water level measurements were provided in a 15-

minute resolution for the whole period analyzed. Through the German online gauge

                        2
system “Pegel Online” , we acquired an additional dataset that includes information

about the location of each measurement station, the average flood water level over a


time period from 1 November 2000 to 31 October 2010, and the highest water level

ever recorded.


        Additionally, we used HydroSHEDS drainage direction information derived

from elevation data of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) at 3 arc-second

resolution (Lehner et al. 2008). The data is already verified and is considered to be of


adequate quality for our analysis in spite of its limited resolution.



5 Methodology


This section describes the detailed methodology used in this paper, by further

elaborating the procedures used to apply the approach described in Sect. 3 and


schematically depicted in (Figure 1). The next section explains the steps conducted in

preparing the datasets employed (Sect. 5.1), followed in Sect. 5.2 by the description of


the analytical procedures used.

Characterizing the flood phenomenon

        The first part of our data preparation (left-hand box in Fig. 1) consisted of

defining the flood-affected regions based on the digital elevation model (for catchment


areas) and on official data (river water levels). It is further described as follows.



Identifying catchment areas


        The delineation of small catchment areas is based on the HydroSHEDS drainage

direction raster and was implemented using the ArcHydro toolset for ArcGIS. The

workflow to calculate identify catchment areas with ArcGIS is depicted in (Figure 2)


and described in detail by Zhang et al. (2010) and Merwade (2012). Starting with flow

direction information we computed the flow accumulation. This information was then


used to define a stream network. In this case study, grid cells are considered as drainage

channels if 2,000 or more upstream cells drain into it. The drainage channels were

exported as vector data. Finally, catchment areas were delineated using all river


junctions, calculated from the drainage channel vector file. This procedure ensures that

all cells within the same catchment drain into the same stream. As a result we obtained

779 unique catchment polygons.



                        Figure 2. Catchment Processing Workflow.










Calculating the relative water level (flood severity) of catchments


        In this step, we analyzed the water level data collected from 185 water level

measurement stations along the German Federal waterways. To assess the local water

level at a given gauge station, we computed the difference between the daily maximum

water level and the average flood water level for the time period from 1 November 2000

to 31 October 2010. From now on, we refer to this difference as the ‘relative water


level’ and use this as the variable for the measuring the severity of a flood. Thus,

negative values indicate that the local water level at the gauge station was below an

average flood water level. Therefore this station can be considered as not flood-affected.


Conversely, positive values indicate that the gauging station was flood-affected. The use

of a daily maximum is justified in this case since this was a slow onset flood and the

Twitter dataset is sparse. However, for more dynamic scenarios such as flash floods, a


higher temporal resolution could be used, e.g. by calculating maximum water levels

hourly, or even in a finer timescale.


        We thus combined geometric information on catchments and water levels as

attribute values based on the location of the monitoring stations. The relative water level

values were matched to the corresponding catchments. If more than one water level


measurement station was found to be within one given catchment, we assigned their

arithmetic mean to the catchment and classified it as flood-affected based on this value.




Processing georeferenced tweets

 The processing of tweets (right-hand box in Fig. 1) enclosed three steps (keyword-

based filtering, content analysis and thematic coding) which are explained as follows.


Keyword-based filtering

        For identifying messages containing relevant information, we first filtered the


Twitter messages that referred to the flooding event. This was accomplished by

keyword filtering, which is common practice in the analysis of Twitter messages

(Vieweg et al. 2010, Graham et al. 2012, Kongthon et al. 2012). Tweets containing the

German-language keywords “Hochwasser”, “Flut”, “Überschwemmung” (meaning


“flood”) or the English word “flood”, regardless of capitalization, were retained.

Keyword selection was based on the definition of the German dictionary “Duden” for

the word “Hochwasser”. Furthermore, we included the additional words “Deich” (dike)


and “Sandsack” (sandbag), which were found to be common in media reports.

Hyperlinks contained in the tweets were not examined at this stage.




Content analysis: assessment of text and hyperlinks


        Tweets that did not contain the keywords defined above were marked as “off

topic” without any further content examination. Messages containing the keywords


were then scrutinized individually by three independent persons and classified into the

following categories: (0) off topic (i.e. the message was not related to floods even


though it contained one of the keywords), (1) on topic but not relevant, (2) on topic and

relevant. An on-topic tweet was considered “relevant” if it contained information that


may contribute to situation awareness. For example, tweets containing situational

updates and other information that could be useful for other persons and/or emergency


agencies were classified as “relevant.” After the independent classification by the three

researchers, cases of disagreement were discussed individually to reach a consensus in


each case.

         Tweet relevance was not only assessed based on its text content itself, but also


following the hyperlinks (e.g. to pictures) contained in the text. For example, the text of


the tweet in (Figure 3) does not contain any relevant information, but the referenced


picture does, since it depicts the current situation corresponding to the timestamp and


the geographic coordinate of the tweet. It was therefore classified as “relevant”.

Thematic coding of on-topic tweets (a bottom-up approach)

        On-topic tweets were also coded considering their contents. The content-based


classification of messages requires a well-defined set of categories, which heavily

depends on the crisis context analyzed, i.e. it varies for each crisis phenomenon and


event. We adopted the categories proposed by Imran et al. (2013) (“caution and

advice”, “information source”, “donation”, “causalities and damages”, “unknown”) and

Vieweg et al. (2010) (warning, preparatory activity, fire line/hazard location, flood


level, weather, wind, visibility, road conditions, advice, evacuation information,

volunteer information, animal management, and damage/injury reports). However,


neither of the previous sets of categories was well suited for our case study, the River

Elbe flood. We therefore used these previous classifications as a guideline and adapted

them to derive a modified classification for this study.


        We chose a bottom-up approach to classify tweets considering their thematic

context. Three independent persons qualitatively coded all on-topic tweets by assigning


any number of codes they felt necessary to express the thematic context of the

messages. Following this, the labels were compared and merged. Both text and pictures


of the Twitter messages were used for thematic coding.

        As a result, we grouped on-topic tweets into seven thematic groups: (1)

“volunteer actions”, (2) “media reports”, (3) “traffic conditions”, (4), “first hand


observations”, (5) “official actions”, (6) “infrastructure damage”, (0) “other”. (Table 2)

presents a detailed description of the thematic groups and their characteristics.

Establishing the geographical relations between tweets and the flood phenomena


The final part of our data preparation consisted of calculating the geographical relations


based on both authoritative data and tweets (box in the center of Fig. 1). The proximity

relationship for each tweet was calculated as the distance in meters between the location


of the tweet and the nearest flood-affected catchment. Tweets that are located within the


area of flood-affected catchments had the distance variable assigned with zero meters

(“0 m”). The severity relationship, in turn, is defined as the relative water level of the


catchment in which the tweet was located.





5.2 Statistical Data Analysis


The purpose of the statistical analysis of Twitter data was (1) to identify general spatial


patterns in the occurrence of on-topic tweets that may be associated with distance to and


relative water level of flood events, and (2) to further explore possible differences in

spatial patterns among subtypes of on-topic tweets. Challenging aspects in this analysis


relate to possible nonlinearities, the expected (statistical) interaction between relative


water level and distance to flood, and spatial autocorrelation among observations.

Interaction, in this context, refers to the possibility that, for example, on-topic tweets

to the published version for referencing.

cluster more strongly around catchments with extremely high water levels compared to

catchments with lower water levels.


We address these challenges by using generalized additive models (GAMs) in


conjunction with a spatial bootstrap procedure to estimate spatial differences in on-topic

tweet frequency. Only tweets located within a 100 km distance of flood-affected

catchments were used (320 on-topic and 10% of the 27,410 available off-topic tweets).


        GAMs are nonlinear, or partly nonlinear, extensions of GLMs, such as logistic

regression, that replace the linear predictor terms with nonlinear (spline-type) smoothers


of adjustable flexibility (Wood 2006). Examples of their application in geospatial

modeling include landslide susceptibility modeling and spatial epidemiology (among

others Vieira et al. (2008), Goetz et al. (2011)).


        For the analysis of general pattern in the distribution of on-topic tweets we use

GAMs with a logistic link function and two numeric predictors, relative water level (as

defined above, in m) and the logarithm (base 10) of the Euclidean distance (in km) to


the nearest flood-affected catchment. To avoid that the results are excessively

influenced by extreme values, we trimmed relative water level at +/-1.0 m. To mitigate

the coarse nature of the “0” distance corresponding to a location within a flood-affected


catchment, all distances <10 km were assigned a value of 10 km prior to taking the

logarithm.

        We used the GAM implementation of Wood (2006) in the R package “mgcv”,


which automatically adjusts the effective degrees of freedom of the spline smoothers

using a generalized cross-validation procedure. The “bam” implementation for large


data sets was chosen. Alternative GAMs were fitted that represent the two predictors as

additive terms (two univariate thin plate splines) or as an interactive term (one bivariate

thin plate spline smoother). Upper limits of 3 and 5 effective degrees of freedom were

used in the additive and interactive models, respectively, in order to avoid excessive

oscillations in the resulting smoothers.

        In addition to the visual summaries provided by the GAM, we used the GAMs to


calculate odds ratios and relative risks associated with distance and water level. The

odds, p/(1 – p), are a common way of re-expressing a probability p in the context of

logistic models, and the ratio of odds corresponding to different levels of a predictor


variable is a measure of its effect size. Similarly, the relative risk is the ratio of

probabilities predicted by the GAM. In this study, odds ratios and relative risk were

calculated for ≤10 km versus 30 km distance from flood-affected areas, and for a


relative water level of +0.75 m versus -0.75 m while keeping the other predictor

constant. In the case of the GAM with an interaction of distance and water level we


calculated odds ratios and relative risk of one predictor at different levels of the other

predictor.

        Since the GAM does not provide parametric estimates of the sampling


variability of odds ratio and relative risk, we applied a spatial block bootstrap to obtain

percentile confidence intervals at the 95% level. The bootstrap is a resampling-based

estimation procedure that simulates the natural sampling variability by drawing


observations from the available data (Davison et al. 2003). Since observations close to

each other may be autocorrelated, we resampled the observations at a spatially

aggregated level (blocks) rather than individual tweets, similar to the procedure used by


Brenning et al. (2014). We used 100 blocks defined by 100-means clustering of the

spatial coordinates of tweets, drew 100 out of these 100 blocks randomly with


replacement, and used this set as a training set for refitting the GAM. The entire sample

was then used to obtain an estimate of the odds ratio and relative risk, and the procedure

was repeated 2500 times in order to obtain the resampling distribution of these

parameters and derive their 95% percentile confidence intervals.

        Spatial patterns of subtypes of on-topic tweets were furthermore explored using


GAMs to model the probability that an on-topic tweet belongs to a specific subtype.

This analysis was based on the sample of on-topic tweets within the 100 km buffer (N =

320). On the one hand, one model was fitted to identify patterns of tweets identified as


relevant (N = 169) versus not relevant in relation to distance to flood and relative water

level. This addresses the question whether more relevant tweets are more strongly

concentrated in proximity to flood-affected areas or in catchments with higher relative


water levels. On the other hand, separate models were built to relate the occurrence of a

specific thematic category to distance and water level. The expectation is that thematic


classes that are more strongly related to local conditions (e.g., first-hand observations)

are also more strongly concentrated near flood-affected areas and where relative water

levels are higher. Three aggregated thematic classes were considered due to sample size


limitations, and the “other” category was omitted: (1) “volunteer actions” (N = 67); (2)

“media reports” and “traffic conditions” (N = 55); (3) “first hand observations”,

“official actions”, “infrastructure damage” (N = 92). Due to the smaller sample size


only GAMs without interaction term were considered, and only basic graphical and

numeric summaries are provided for exploratory analysis of these patterns.

6.1 Data Description



(Figure 4) shows flood-affected catchments and the relative water level of the flooding

calculated from digital elevation data and water level data for the time period from 8 to


10June 2013. Clearly visible is the shift of the flood peak from the upper reaches


(southeast) on 8 June to the lower reaches (north) on 10 June. On 8June 2013 the


catchments along the river Elbe in the federal state of Saxony were most affected, whilst


the lower reaches of the river Elbe were not affected until 10 June 2013.

         Overall we examined 60,524 tweets within the territory of Germany from the


June 8-10, 2013 period. Of these only 370 tweets could be labeled as “on topic” based


on keyword filtering and manual classification of tweets, while more than 99% were


classified as “off topic”. On topic tweets distribute nearly equal into relevant and not


relevant tweets (Table 3).


         In terms of their content about two-fifth of all on-topic tweets contained


information referring to volunteer actions (19.2%) or first-hand observations (18.6%),

whereas on topic tweets referring to traffic conditions, official actions or infrastructure

        A comparison of the spatial distributions of on-topic tweets and flood-affected

catchments (see (Figure 4) and (Figure 5)) shows that a considerable portion


corresponds to flood-affected catchments. To further examine this relationship we

statistically analyzed the distance of all tweets to flood-affected catchments.




6.2 Spatial Analysis

        The spatial analysis of tweets using the GAM showed a strong association of on-


topic tweets with distance to flood-affected catchments and relative water level (Table

5; Fig. 6). On-topic tweets were 11.0 times (95% confidence interval: 2.5-35.6) as likely


to occur near (≤10 km away from) flood-affected catchments with a high relative water

levels (0 and -0.75 m), in contrast, there was no significant association with distance.

         Even more pronounced – but also subject to greater uncertainty – was the


association of on-topic tweets with relative water level when considering areas in close

proximity to flood-affected catchments based on the GAM with interaction (Table 5;

Fig. 7). At distances ≤10 km, tweets near strongly affected catchments with a relative

water level of +0.75 m were 54 times as likely to be on-topic as tweets in proximity to

unaffected catchments with a relative water level of -0.75 m. While an association with


relative water level was still marginally significant at 30 km distance to flood-affected

areas, there was, not surprisingly, no association at greater distances.

        Compared with general flood-related tweets there is perhaps a tendency for


“relevant” on-topic tweets to be closer to flood-affected catchments (odds ratio 2.2 at

≤10 km compared to 30 km distance), and in particular close to catchments with higher

relative water level (odds ratio 2.9 for relative water level of +0.75 m versus -0.75 m).


        Associations of thematic categories of on-topic tweets with flood distance and

relative water level were comparatively weak and highly uncertain (Table 6). The


thematic group of tweets related to first-hand observations, official actions and

infrastructure damage appears to be somewhat more frequent at shorter distances and

higher relative water levels compared to general flood-related tweets (odds ratios 1.6


and 2.0, respectively), while tweets concerning media reports and traffic situation

tended to be more weakly associated with distance and relative water levels (odds ratios

more strongly with relative water level compared to general flood-related tweets (odds

7 Discussion


This paper presents a geographical approach for identifying relevant georeferenced


social messages based on authoritative data on flood phenomena. The goal was to


investigate if this approach is able to identify the most useful messages for the purpose

of extracting information that can be valuable for improving situation awareness in


flood events.

The statistical analysis of the tweets sent during the floods in Germany 2013 has


confirmed the relevance of our approach. Tweets related to the flood (i.e. on topic) were

11 times more likely to occur near (≤10 km away from) flood-affected areas, i.e. in


catchments with a high relative water level (+0.75 m), than 30 km away from such

areas. Furthermore, tweets near severely affected catchments with a relative water level

of +0.75 m are 54 times more likely to be on-topic than tweets in proximity to


unaffected catchments. In this manner, the hypothesis can be accepted that the

geographical relations proximity and relative water level are both strong predictors of


the usefulness of tweets in the analyzed case. Thus, by using the calculated values for

the geographical relations proximity to and severity of floods for prioritizing social

media messages, one can expect a significantly higher probability of identifying


information that is useful for improving situational awareness in disaster management.

        These findings are consistent with previous analyses on social media usage in


disasters, which identified a distinct role of users local to the event (or “on the ground”),
This is an Accepted Manuscript of an article published in International Journal of Geographical
Information Science, available online: http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/136 58816.2014.996567 . Please refer

who are more probable to generate useful information for improving situational

awareness (Starbird et al. 2010, Vieweg et al. 2010, Acar and Muraki 2011, Starbird

and Muzny 2012, Imran et al. 2013). However, these approaches analyze the contents of


the messages, based on which they seek to classify messages/users as “local” or “on the

ground”. The increasing amount of georeferenced social media messages that is

becoming available in the last years enables us to work the other way round by taking a


geographical approach: based on the relative location of social media messages, we can

determine the most useful ones. In this way, we were able to do a more precise,

quantitative assessment of the messages based on their calculated geographical relations


with flooded areas (proximity and relative water level). These relations offer a much

more fine-grained distinction than the binary classifications (local/non-local) previously


used.

        Another advantage of the geographical approach is that it enables a rigorous

statistical data analysis by the use of a generalized additive model that is able to cope


with possible nonlinearities and the expected interaction between relative water level of

and distance to flood, as well as with spatial autocorrelation in social media data. As a

result, this paper adds to previous research on spatial analysis of social media in


disasters (Croitoru et al. 2013, Crooks et al. 2013, Fuchs et al. 2013) by presenting

more rigorous evidence for a strong spatial association between locational proximity to

floods and the usefulness of the messages for crisis management, and it transfers


modeling approaches from the broader field of hazard modeling (Brenning et al., 2014)

to the analysis of social media data.


        However, these results should be considered within the scope and limitations of

the present study. As for its external validity, this study must be replicated for different

scenarios and hazards types to allow a wider generalization. Even though this work

examined a large and dense dataset, the messages related to floods consist of a small

fraction (0.6%) of the total number of messages. This can be partially explained by the

low ratio of tweets to Internet users in Germany (Stephens and Graham 2012), and


possibly also to the unknown proportion of the overall tweet population that was

available for this study. However, the small percentage of tweets that are related to the

floods in Germany in 2013 was also observed in the study of Fuchs et al. (2013). This


may have influenced also the weaker associations we found between the thematic

categories of tweets and the geographical relations, since the number of messages in

each category was relatively small. Furthermore, the bottom-up approach we used in the


categorization has the advantage of yielding meaningful categories for the case at hand,

but imposes limitations on the generalizability of our results to other cases and


scenarios. Thematic categorization is indeed generally problematic in social media

analysis, as it can be noticed from the lack of standards for categories in the existing

work, in particular in the context of disaster management (Vieweg et al. 2010, Imran et


al. 2013).

        Additionally, during the manual scrutiny of the set of tweets obtained after the

keyword-based filtering (see Sect. 5.1), we found out that in some cases the relevance of


a message for improving situational awareness depends more on the picture itself than

on its accompanying text, as is the case of Figure 3. A georeferenced picture of a

flooded area can be a very useful piece of information during crisis response, since it is


able to depict the current situation in a very granular way, and thus contribute to

decision-making. For instance, a picture could contain information about whether a


particular street, or even a specific part of the street, is usable or not for evacuation

purposes.

        In the case of the tweet in Figure 3, the user additionally provided the hashtags

“#hochwasser” and “flut” (flood) and that is why it was included after our initial

filtering. Nevertheless, it may be the case that some messages of our dataset contain


similar content but did not include any of the selected keywords and were thus

classified as off topic. In this manner, owing to the manual screening of all “on topic

tweets” we can be sure not to have any misclassified on topic messages (i.e. “false


positives”), but we cannot rule out the existence of misclassified off topic tweets (i.e.

“false negatives”). This is a common limitation of studies that work with text-based

analysis of social media (e.g. De Longueville et al. 2009, MacEachren et al. 2011,


Terpstra and Vries 2012, Fuchs et al. 2013, Spinsanti and Ostermann 2013), which

could only be completely overcome either with a very costly manual verification of the


whole dataset (alternatively, of significant random samples), or by developing a filter

based on precise image-processing algorithms. Unfortunately, none of these alternatives

were feasible in the present study due to time and resource constraints, but this is an


interesting direction for future work.

        Although this limitation may introduce a bias into the statistical results, it is

unlikely that this would completely reserve the strong and significant statistical


relationships that we observed between locational proximity/relative water level and

usefulness of tweets. Furthermore, the difficulty in classifying pictures actually speaks

in favor of the geographical approach as a whole, since the location-based identification


of relevant messages we propose could be performed independently of the content of

the social media messages, as opposed to other approaches based on natural language


processing and machine learning (Starbird and Muzny 2012, Imran et al. 2013). Hence,

future work can explore the application of the geographical approach to other social

media platforms that are mainly based on photo and video sharing (e.g. Flickr,

Instagram). Furthermore, the location-based approach proposed here could be easily


combined both with automated classification algorithms (e.g. being considered as

weights for the classification of relevance) and with manual/crowdsourced examination


(e.g. being used for ranking messages before human verification/processing), thus

improving accuracy and efficiency of existing approaches. Therefore, this consists of an


important avenue for future research endeavors.

        In this manner, despite the limitations of this study, our findings imply that the


geographical approach can serve as a basis for improving existing on-line monitoring

systems. This could be accomplished by relying upon the quantitative indicators that we


define for measuring the geographical relations proximity to and severity of floods, in

order to automatically rate and prioritize incoming social media messages “on-the fly”.


This approach may thereby offer a contribution for extending existing commercial tools

(e.g. Geofeedia , Twitcident ) and research studies (MacEachren et al. 2011, Terpstra


and Vries 2012, Croitoru et al. 2013, Spinsanti and Ostermann 2013) that aim for

location-based knowledge discovery from social media. Most of these approaches


(MacEachren et al. 2011, Terpstra and Vries 2012, Croitoru et al. 2013) provide


visualizations exclusively based on inherent relations of social media data (e.g. semantic

clustering or user network analyses), and could thus be improved by additionally


resorting to external data sources for considering the geographical relations to disaster

phenomena proposed here. Thus, our approach can offer a significant aid to the task of


identifying useful messages both by emergency management professionals and the

affected population of “everyday analysts” (Palen et al. 2010), who currently mostly

information, as reported for instance by Latonero and Shklovski (2011).



8 Conclusion

        This paper seeks to make an additional contribution to the nascent research that

combines social media data with geoinformation coming from other sources,


particularly for the context of disaster management (Spinsanti and Ostermann 2013,

Triglav-Čekada and Radovan 2013, Schnebele et al. 2014). Results show that the

geographical approach proposed here for quantitatively assessing social media messages


based on authoritative data, can be a viable and useful way to improve the identification

of messages that contain useful information for managing disasters.

        In this manner, the analysis of social media messages based on their


geographical relations to the disaster phenomena is a relevant approach for coping with

the characteristic noisiness/variability, volume and velocity of data stemming from

social media. Existing geographical knowledge and authoritative data consist of


valuable resources for spatially parsing ‘big’ social media data, by making it possible to

efficiently order, and thereby ultimately reducing, the information space that must be


searched for useful pieces of information. Future work should thus further develop this

approach by considering other information sources (e.g. satellite or aerial images, land

use data from authoritative sources or OpenStreetMap) and by deriving new


geographical relations that better help us to explore the potential opened by social media

by leveraging geographical knowledge.
