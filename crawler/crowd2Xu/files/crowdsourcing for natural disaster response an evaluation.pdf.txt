           CROWDSOURCING FOR NATURAL DISASTER RESPONSE:

                     AN EVALUATION OF CRISIS MAPPING


                        THE 2010 HAITIAN EARTHQUAKE



                                   Annie Feighery




       On January 12, 2010, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti, causing

catastrophic damages that resulted in at least 300,000 dead, 300,000 serious injuries, and

1.8 million homeless. The destruction was so complete that roads were no longer visible.


While buildings, roads, power, and other infrastructure have taken years to restore,

mobile phone service was restored almost immediately. A communications network

based on mobile phone text messages became an innovative and valuable tool for relief.


       Within four hours of the earthquake, a crisis map was established, geocoding

messages for inclusion in a freely accessible, online database. Over the next three

months, over 3,600 messages would be translated, mapped, and coded with labels


indicating the messages’ actionable topics. This undertaking involved over 2,000 online

volunteers from around the world. Analyzing and evaluating what happened, what

worked, and what went wrong from a programmatic perspective is critical for the future

use of crisis maps in disasters and for the future integration of new technologies into


large bureaucratic entities.
        The purpose of this study was to investigate the diffusion of a novel innovation;

analyze aspects of the maps’ deployment that limited success; and posit solutions for


improving crisis mapping in natural disasters. The manuscript comprises three papers,

beginning with a review of literature and emerging tools for social media and health

promotion. The second paper developed an automated algorithm to code the need

expressed in texts and compared its reliability to the actual human-derived codes. The


findings suggest that automated algorithms can enhance speed of response and overcome

human biases. The result is improved situational awareness. Algorithm codes revealed a

pattern of message topics, which transitioned from emergency needs, including finding


missing persons, to health infrastructure requests, primarily for food and water. The third

paper employed a social capital framework to understand the system users’ intents. The

findings revealed that individuals far outnumbered aid organizations in users of the


system. Also whereas the traditional rapid analysis takes six weeks, the messages

revealed real-time needs. These findings suggest that machine coding methodology could

increase accuracy of situational analysis and speed response in future disasters.

                                     INTRODUCTION





                The world is getting flatter faster in technology than health
                and wealth so we should all be using technology to achieve
                our goals in health and wealth. (Rosling, 2006)



        On January 12, 2010, the same day a large earthquake struck Haiti, Stacy Delince,

in Montreal, Canada, was catching up with friends on Facebook when she noticed a

particularly urgent status update:

          Jean-Olivier Neptune is caught under rubbles of his fallen house. He is alive but

        in very bad shape. please please hurry and get there as soon as you can and please
        put this info in your statuses, * rue Mont-Joli Turgeau ! URGENT !

Ms. Delince did not know Jean-Olivier Neptune, but immediately reacted by calling the

Haitian Emand, the Red Cross, and news organizations in an attempt to alert someone in


Haiti as to Mr. Neptune’s urgent request and his location (Samuel, 2010).

        The victim, Mr. Neptune, had been able to text his relatives in the United States

about his situation and, within hours, his message was noticed and relayed through online


communities. In Washington, D.C., Claire Berlinski, a journalist, reported that she felt

“distraught” because she had relatives in Haiti and no way to help (Berlinski, 2010).

However, she did find a way to get involved with a network of volunteers, calling

themselves crisis mappers, who were implementing a novel approach to disaster response


known as crowdsourcing. Ms. Berlinski, along with thousands of other volunteers from


                                                   	  
                                                                                             2


around the world, translated messages from Haitian Creole and attempted to determine

their location, allowing them to be immediately displayed on a public website with a map


interface. By 3:00 p.m. that afternoon, Mr. Neptune was rescued.

        The global collaborative response to the Haitian earthquake marked an important

moment in the evolution of disaster preparedness and response. The emerging paradigm

of participatory (interactive), porous (where organizational communication boundaries


are no longer fixed and impenetrable for external ideas), and nimble (easily changing)

management structures contrasted with the traditional, hierarchical, information-

controlled structure of the UN Cluster Response system. Initially overwhelmed by more


than 2,000 “volunteers” who wanted to help, many UN agencies and organizations were

reluctant to engage with this community. What ensued in the following months was the

diffusion of an innovation, crisis mapping, through the management infrastructure of


international disaster responders, resulting in acceptance and adoption of participatory

approaches to disasters.


                                        Background


        Social network theory comprises a field of study that seeks to understand ideas,


knowledge, and behavior as they move through interpersonal networks. Early research

conducted by a foundational group of researchers that included Syme, Breslow, Berkman,

and Granovetter helped establish the understanding that causal forces for health and well-


being were not only influenced by individual behavior choices, but rather by a

complicated web of causation that includes the social environment in which individual

behavior takes place (Krieger, 1994). The field’s cohesion is largely credited to the


foundational text, Diffusion of Innovations, by Everett Rogers, which was first published

                                                   	  
                                                                                              3


in 1962 and updated five times until the last edition emerged in 2002, two years before

Rogers’ death.


        In a discussion of ideal types of social networks, Lin (2001) explained that dense,

closed networks are ideal for “preserving or maintaining resources,” citing the example

of children’s safety in a cohesive community. However, a less dense, open network may

be more suitable for “searching for and obtaining resources” (Lin, 2001). In the context


of a natural disaster, the most disadvantaged individuals might be expected to prefer the

protected nature of closed networks even though their access to resources might be

improved by participating in more open networks. Likewise, disaster response


organizations might prefer closed networks to preserve precious resources such as time

and access to communication networks, with the unintended consequence of becoming

isolated from individual expressions of need. Following a disaster, perhaps the most


important resource to be obtained by responders is information: who and what is in need,

in addition to questions about resources and availability of support. Thus, a loose, open

social network may be theoretically ideal for integration with the traditional vertical

nature of disaster response. Crowdsourcing has emerged as one such strategy for


improving traditional bureaucratic response by incorporating data obtained from more

open and accessible networks.


                                  Theoretical Foundation



Social Capital Exchanges in Social Networks

        The majority of research on social networks involves one of two methodologies.

The first, and most feasible, is an individual level, called ego-centric, approach that first


identifies the participant, and then maps the participant’s social connections as if the

                                                    	  
                                                                                               4


participant is the hub of a wheel and the connections are the wheel’s spokes (Smith &

Christakis, 2008). The second begins at the social level by defining a population and


attempts to map each participant as a node in the network with interrelationships to other

nodes (Smith & Christakis, 2008).

        In the past, the fields of health education and health behavior have often followed

the ego-centric approach as the model of health behavior (Hochbaum & Services, 1958).


In a longitudinal study of 10 community-based participatory health promotion projects,

lack of utilization was the primary problem discovered (Altman et al., 1991). However, in

surveys, the program directors listed problems with funding and program promotion


above effectiveness of their programs (Altman et al., 1991). As opposed to ego-centric

models, broader, network-centered models of health behavior provide a view of causal

forces. Social network theory offers health researchers an opportunity to study human


behavior and collective action at a more comprehensive level than is offered when the

individual is the variable measured. Rogers (2003) explained that the system-level focus

in social networks research allows the researcher to analyze the success or failure of an

innovation to disseminate in terms of the system design, as opposed to the irrationality of


individuals within the system. In health research, the innovation is often a new approach

to increasing help-seeking behavior. This can be a technology, such as a new mobile

phone app, or a communication pattern, such as motivational interviewing. McKenzie et


al. (2005) asserted that successful health promotion program implementation depends on

this broader, systems-level approach. Diffusion of successful health innovations depends

on the network in order to avoid what Rogers (1953) termed “the individual blame bias.”






                                                    	  
                                                                                              5


        In social networks research, individuals are conceptualized as nodes.

Relationships are either analyzed at a dyadic, micro level among pairs of people or a


supradyadic level among the entire network in the sample population. In both cases,

measuring social capital is an informative means of characterizing the connections.

Relationships can be evaluated through measures of structural social capital with features

such as interpersonal trust, social support, and the degree of homophily or heterophily


between the two individuals in the pair—bonding and bridging (Harpham, Grant, &

Thomas, 2002). The network itself can be evaluated with measures of cognitive social

capital such as values and norms that might define an orientation toward cooperative


behavior (Putnam, 2001).

        Individuals or organizations that move freely between closed networks are termed

boundary spanners (Burt, 2001; Kapuku, 2006; Williams, 2002). Because they share


features of both a closed group and an external group, they can be seen as a safer source

of new ideas than an individual from a bridged network. As a result, Rogers (1953)

suggested they be seen as change agents, or opportunities to insert a new innovation in a

closed group.



Social Capital and Health Outcomes

        In terms of health outcomes, social networks have the biggest impact based on

two features: size of the network and type of connections that dominate an individual’s


network. The positive impacts on health well-being from larger social networks are

theorized to result from a greater social surface area, or exposure to more information and

new ideas and innovations. In his initial exploration of this relationship, Granovetter


(1973) examined whether individuals seeking a job were more likely to be successful if


                                                    	  
                                                                                               6


their social networks were comprised of mostly strong or weak ties. The concept of weak

ties has conceptually developed into what is now termed “bridging relationships” and the


concept of strong ties has developed into what is now termed “bonding relationships”

(Lin, 2002). Granovetter found that weak ties provided people with more job

opportunities because they offer greater access to information and resources due to the

network diversity and larger surface area. He postulated that the advantage of these


resources outweighed the advantages of the more established, tightly bonded network.

        Beyond size, the connections among individuals are characterized in two ways:

strong ties versus weak ties and hemophilic relationships (with a high degree of likeness)


versus heterophilic relationships (with a high degree of difference). These two often

correlate within each other, as seen when strong ties are formed most often with

homophilic, or likeness relationships, and weak ties are most common with heterophilic,


or difference relationships (Lin, 2002, p. 39). Strong networks of homophilic individuals

are ideal for preserving resources and culture. Lin gives the example of elite or privileged

groups when explaining the social situation in which this is ideal. However, this kind of

network often does not allow an inflow of new ideas and innovations (Rogers, 2003,


p. 19).

        While heterophilic, weaker, and larger networks allow for improved diffusion of

ideas, new research indicates that a network that possesses features of both extremes is


actually ideal. In an online simulated model of diffusion, Centola (2010) demonstrated

that a “clustered-lattice” network out-performed a strictly heterophilic network of greater

size. This finding echoes Rogers’ (2003) method for diffusion, which discussed the need


to “bridge the heterophily gap” (p. 28). Rogers recommended change agents that are



                                                    	  
                                                                                               7


heterophilic to those that seek to employ an aide from that network to introduce the new

idea. In practice, this is the role of peer leaders in health interventions.


        Research has demonstrated that the types of connections that characterize

individuals’ social networks have profound impacts on health and well-being. Lin (2002)

established that the functional benefit networks provide for individuals stems from the

social capital resources embedded within the connections that comprise the network. In a


cross-sectional study of mothers and children in the Andhra Pradesh state of India,

researchers found a positive relationship between a mother’s level of social capital and

her children’s level of nutrition (Moestue, Huttly, Sarella, & Galab, 2007). The study


differentiated measures of social capital by network size, heterogeneity (bridging), and

maternal age. The findings reinforced Granovetter’s (1983) hypothesis that the risks of

poverty can be mitigated by a network composed of many diverse ties. The authors found


that the mothers in this study were specifically using their network to communicate

health information and a greater number of sources resulted in improved information and,

consequentially, health outcomes for their children (Moestue et al., 2007). An interesting

additional finding was that the protective relationship was stronger for mothers over the


age of 25 than under, which was theorized to indicate that younger women still put a

greater value on information from their strong ties, i.e., mother-in-law or spouse, as

opposed to their social network (Moestue et al., 2007).



Diffusion of Information Within Social Networks

        Social network theory is based on the diffusion paradigm, which suggests that

new ideas and behaviors tend to follow specific patterns as they become adopted by a


community, or clique. It involves five stages: knowledge, persuasion, decision (to reject


                                                    	  
                                                                                               8


or accept), implementation, and confirmation (Rogers, 2003). It is further influenced by

five categories of adopters: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and


laggards (Rogers, 2003). Diffusion tends to follow an S-shaped curve marking the slow

adoption in early stages, the rapid adoption as the early and late majority take up the idea

or behavior—whereupon a critical mass occurs, preventing any halting of the rate—and a

slow rate of adoption once only laggards remain.


        The earliest diffusion study on record is an analysis of the diffusion of hybrid seed

corn among farmers conducted by Ryan and Gross (1943). The earliest health-related

diffusion study was conducted by Columbia University researchers Coleman, Katz, and


Menzel (1957) on the adoption of the antibiotic, tricyclene, among New England

physicians. Both studies independently found the classic S-shaped curve of diffusion.

Even more striking, both studies found that early adopters tended to be more


“cosmopolite”—marked by either the farmer’s or physician’s exposure to big cities

(Rogers, 2003, p. 67).

        Rogers (2002) found that individuals’ exposure to new ideas was itself one of the

critical aspects of the diffusion process. While individuals are more likely to consider a


change in their behavior or thinking as observed by someone very similar to themselves,

homophily by definition inhibits new ideas or behaviors because of that similarity. As a

result, heterophilic relationships are a greater source of innovation. Rogers identified a


process in which an aide can be employed to assist a change agent in the case that too

much heterophily exists. In this case, a person who is very similar to the target clique

“bridges the heterophily gap” (p. 28).






                                                    	  
                                                                                               9


        A key advantage of conducting research on social networks is the focus on the

systems-level success or failure of behavior change, as opposed to what Rogers (2002)


explained as the individual blame bias of social research. Because the primary tool of

social scientists is the survey, administered at an individual level, assessments of success

or failure often fall on the individual and miss the opportunity to see the individual’s

logical response to a larger system (Rogers, 2003).



                       Help-Seeking Behavior in Natural Disasters


        In a sense, disaster response is and always has been crowdsourced, or outsourced

to a large, informal network of people with resources to solve a problem. In a study of


earthquake relief, Hilhorst (2004) found that at least 90% of the assistance people receive

is from informal means of support, as opposed to organizational or governmental means

of support. This is likely due to two factors: 1) the inability of organizations and


government entities to reach more individuals in a setting with destroyed infrastructure,

and 2) a phenomenon of social ties that results in a social norm that makes a taboo of

accepting formal means of support.

        Applying a theory first identified as amoral familism by Banfield (1958), Gans


(1965) conducted an ethnographic study of a Boston slum inhabited mostly by Italian

immigrants, and found that the group behavior self-regulated against new innovations

with both subtle and overt tactics like ridicule and exclusion. Even when the innovations


were clearly in the best interest of the individuals, such as organizing to block the

impending razing of the neighborhood, the group behavior shunned change.

Consequently, this bonding group tended to make bridging behavior into a taboo, or an




                                                    	  
                                                                                             10


out-group behavior for fear of losing the cohesion and exclusiveness that marked the

bonding group.


        The health outcomes of this finding are readily apparent in disaster response, such

as with a Hurricane Andrew case study conducted by Hurlbert et al. (2001). The authors

followed individuals’ help-seeking behavior in response to the hurricane’s devastation

and found that people in tightly-knit, bonded groups were least likely to seek or accept


formal means of support, such as food vouchers. Instead, they turned to each other for

support. This finding was reinforced in a study of Hurricane Floyd’s aftermath, which

found Medicaid applications did not increase despite widespread financial shock to


already-vulnerable households (Domino, 2003). A study on the social capital of

Hurricane Katrina’s aftermath also showed that the bonding behavior quickly bankrupted

groups’ resources, with the result being an increase in their vulnerability (Hawkins,


2010).


                                 The Sociology of Disasters


        Within the academic literature of the field of sociology, the sub-discipline of

disasters includes a deep discourse of the nature of disasters, organizational behavior, and


community responses. Two key concepts about how people organize themselves in a

disaster are emergence and convergence. Emergence refers to newly arising organized

structures and convergence refers to people and organizations coming together for a


united purpose of disaster response (Tierney, Lindell, & Perry, 2003).

        A guiding principle is that of the ordering of magnitude of social problems,

ranging from emergencies, which may be serious everyday problems, to disasters, to


catastrophes, which are far larger social problems than disasters (Quarentelli, 2006). The

                                                    	  
                                                                                             11


ordering is important to note because of the patterns sociologists have observed in

disaster responses. Under the criteria Quarentelli (2006) established for determining the


difference between disasters and catastrophes, the Haiti 2010 earthquake was assuredly a

catastrophe because: 1) most or all of the built structures were heavily impacted; 2) local

officials were unable to fulfill their roles because they were dead, injured, or also

seriously impacted; 3) multiple communities were impacted so that help from nearby


communities was not available; 4) most or all of everyday community functions could

not continue; 5) mass media sources constructed a discourse of disaster; and 6) the

national government and top officials became involved—in Haiti, this was true to the


extreme extent in that top government officials from many nations became involved.

        Using the term major disasters rather than catastrophes, Smith (2011) explained

that, when integrated with local input, financial and technical assistance has the potential


to strengthen communities undergoing disaster recovery. However, all too often, federal

centralized administration of disaster response results in inefficient responses. Smith

explained that responders’ ability to integrate local needs into their programming

depended on “the ability of assistance recipients to communicate their needs through their


involvement in the collection, analysis, and display of pertinent information.”


                               The History of Crisis Mapping


        The use of mobile phone communication networks for health responses has been


especially successful in monitoring the advance of viral outbreaks, as in the case of H1N1

(Brownstein et al., 2010), and even stemming the scope of outbreaks, as in the case of the

Global Public Health Information Network created for SARS (Eysenbach, 2003). The


various technological participatory platforms have differed widely on their targeted end

                                                    	  
                                                                                           12


users (Donner, Verclas, & Toyama, 2008). While many are based on Ushahidi and

FrontlineSMS technology platforms, the communication may be unidirectional from aid


organization to individual, as in the case of Google and Grameen’s project to share

farming tips with farmers in Malawi (Donner, 2009), or participatory, as seen in the

WHO’s inclusion of SMS-based communication in its tuberculosis protocol for its drug

treatment-short course (DOTS) (Barclay, 2009).


        Developing advances in uses of SMS are now moving beyond health

interventions into health systems and infrastructure. For instance, Vodafone collaborated

with USAID on a project that utilized FrontlineSMS to transfer money in Afghanistan,


where 98% of the population is not connected to a banking system (Himelfarb, 2010). In

addition, researchers are utilizing FrontlineSMS to replace paper-based surveys and reach

larger numbers of participants in rural and resource poor regions (Jeffrey-Coker,


Basinger, & Modi, 2010).

        The first widely used platform that mapped humanitarian event data through

crowdsourcing (crisis mapping) was Sahana, developed in 2004 in response to a

perceived need to coordinate humanitarian efforts during the South Asian tsunami


(Perera, 2008). Similarly, in 2007, when the Kenyan election threatened the country’s

political stability, a small group of bloggers and software developers combined forces to

write a software code for a program based on Google Maps that would allow people to


report incidences of violence (Ushahidi, 2011). In January 2010, when a devastating

earthquake occurred in Haiti, volunteers from around the world simultaneously began

using the Ushahidi platform, and a few other crisis mobile networks, to share information


on missing persons, health service needs, and available resources (Okolloh, 2009). The



                                                   	  
                                                                                            13


efforts of volunteers resulted in a sudden flood of information that the traditional UN

cluster response was not prepared to manage (Crowley, 2010). The initial result was a


distrust of technology and non-hierarchical organized responses to relief by traditional

disaster response organizations. Over time, however, crisis mapping became acceptable

to UN agencies.


              The Haitian Earthquake and the Crisis Mapping Response



        On a Tuesday afternoon in January 2010, a 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck near

the capital of Haiti. The Haitian government estimated that over 300,000 people lost their

lives and an additional 300,000 were injured (Bilham, 2010). An estimated 1.8 million


people lost their homes (CATDAT, 2010). The Haitian population—already marked by

significant disparities in health and resources before the event—was devastated by the

almost complete destruction of local and national infrastructure, ranging from households


and neighborhoods to municipal entities and medical services. The central Haitian

government sustained a total loss of its fragile infrastructure, causing it to be almost

powerless to respond in an organized manner.

        The international community’s response was quickly organized by the United


Nations (UN) Cluster System, which instituted a hierarchy for communication among all

UN agencies and NGOs approved to assist and named entities in charge of needs

assessments. The UN explained the purpose of the Cluster: “to strengthen partnerships


and ensure more predictability and accountability in international responses to

humanitarian emergencies, by clarifying the division of labour among organisations, and

better defining their roles and responsibilities within the key sectors of the response”


(Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Action [OCHA], 2013).

                                                   	  
                                                                                             14


        Simultaneously, an international online community of crisis mappers, almost

entirely comprised of volunteers, began to organize for a crowdsourced response through


Internet communications technologies (ICT). Volunteers around the world began

capturing text messages sent via the SMS network, translating them into English and

Creole, coding them with locations for use in a geographical information system (GIS),

and mapping the information in crisis maps hosted on Ushahidi’s open source website.


While early messages tended to be requests for assistance finding missing persons, the

overwhelming majority of incoming messages reflected the Haitian population’s need for

food and water support in the weeks after the disaster occurred.


        To some, crisis mappers represented a growing cultural evolution of structuring

the management of organizations that are borderless, collaborative, and pervasively

networked (Rogers, 2011). The earthquake recovery in Haiti was possibly the first time in


history when a large-scale, traditionally-led public health response directly encountered a

large-scale crowdsourced public health response, largely due to rapidly advancing cell

phone and Internet technology that previously had not existed.

        Within the UN and other traditional bureaucratic institutions, decisions are made


in a hierarchical chain of command. However, the crowdsourced theoretical foundation

behind crisis mapping ascribes validity to an increasing sample size as opposed to the

source of the information in communication and information gathering. This type of


information gathering has been referred to as non-probabilistic sampling (Meier, 2011).

As a piece of information is reinforced with increasing related messages, for example,

that a certain neighborhood needs water, it becomes more likely that this information is


valid. Incoming information with only a single source presenting the information is less



                                                    	  
                                                                                           15


likely to be true than information with multiple sources communicating a related need.

Importantly, all aspects of a crowdsourced effort are free and open to public involvement,


from writing the software tools that are to be deployed to accessing the information

gathered.

        Following the deployed Cluster Response, UN agencies were reticent to

incorporate the volunteer ICT community, which gathered information and passed it


along to Cluster agencies with the expectation that action would result. In one account, a

UN worker explained that his department was too overwhelmed with the task of

conducting a needs assessment with its own methodology to also subsume the needs


conveyed through crisis mapping (Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, 2011). The efforts of

volunteers resulted in a sudden flood of information that the traditional UN Cluster

Response was not prepared to manage (Crowley, 2010). A summative evaluation


conducted in collaboration with the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian

Action (UN OCHA), summarized the UN response to the crowdsourced effort as not

equipped to handle “the mobilized swarm of globalized volunteers” (Harvard

Humanitarian Initiative, 2011). The result was a growing distrust of technology and


non-hierarchical organized responses to relief. Among its key findings, the report

recommended a training curriculum for future volunteers on the workings of the UN

history and cluster response. However, in the months following the earthquake, as the


views of high-level managers shifted toward acceptance of the new tools made available

by crowdsourcing, middle management efforts were created to subsume the tools, if not

Purpose


        The purpose of this study was to conduct an in-depth analysis designed to assess

the systems-level interactions between and among established formal disaster response

organizations and new and emergent groups of crisis responders following the Haitian

earthquake and the ensuing health disasters. By examining the complex behavioral


interactions between an established cluster-based disaster response and the inserted

innovation of crowdsourcing for disaster response, this study explored the limitations and

successes of what has since become a successfully adopted technological innovation in


disaster response.


Significance

        The results from this study have policy implications for large bureaucratic


institutions seeking to adapt to the emerging paradigm of participatory management,

marked by increasingly porous information exchange and flatter levels of hierarchy

(Rogers, 2011). The findings also comprise the only summative analysis of crowdsourced

crisis mapping response to the Haitian Earthquake that has been conducted to date and


which includes both the UN and crisis mappers in the analysis. Finally, these results

contribute to the emerging canon of methodology that will be required to analyze social

and participatory health interventions that are delivered through social media.


        In addition, this study contributes to the objectives of Healthy People 2020. Now

in its third iteration, Healthy People 2020 puts forth a decade-long, comprehensive

agenda aimed at improving health for all Americans (U.S. Department of Health and


Human Services, 2011a). The baseline data, goals, and targets delineated within the

                                                   	  
                                                                                           17


agenda establish the nation’s priorities and strategies for improving population health.

This study addresses two Healthy People 2020 Topic Areas in the current agenda: Topic


Area 12, Environmental Health, which includes a focus on disaster preparedness, stating,

that

          Preparedness for the environmental impact of natural disasters as well as
        disasters of human origin includes planning for human health needs and the
        impact on public infrastructure, such as water and roadways


and Topic Area 17,

          Health Communication and Health Information Technology. (U.S. Department
        of Health and Human Services, 2011b)


        The latter is highly relevant to this study to the extent that it addresses the

potential for technological platforms to impact public health through participatory

approaches to health promotion and disease prevention. These impacts include:

        1. building social support networks,


        2. enabling quick and informed action to health risks and public health

            emergencies, and

        3. increasing Internet and mobile access. (U.S. Department of Health and Human


            Services, 2011c)


                                 Definitions of Key Terms


Crisis Mapping


        Crisis mapping is the collective action of online communities to collect real-time

event data and create geocoded maps, providing critical information for the rapid

response to complex emergencies across the globe. Crisis mappers define themselves as

an online community that collectively “leverage mobile and web-based applications,



                                                   	  
                                                                                          18


participatory maps and crowdsourced event data, aerial and satellite imagery, geospatial

platforms, visual analytics, and computational and statistical models to power effective


early warning for rapid response to complex humanitarian emergencies”

(Crisismappers.net, 2011). Crisis mapping is a global phenomenon for which inclusion is

based on network access, as opposed to geographic location. Crisis mappers utilize a

crowdsourced management structure to establish communication networks for situation


awareness in emergency response, such as a natural disaster or political revolution.


Crowdsourcing

        Crowdsourcing is a term first coined by Jeff Howe in an article written for Wired


Magazine in 2006 and later developed into a book by the same name. It denotes an

emerging phenomenon in management that may represent further evolution of Max

Weber’s classic forms of leadership in government: despotic, charismatic, and


bureaucratic. A portmanteau of the words crowd and outsourcing, crowdsourcing is “the

act of a company or institution taking a function once performed by employees and

outsourcing it to an undefined (and generally large) network of people in the form of an

open call” (Howe, 2006).



Free and Open Source Software

        Denoting software that is not protected by copyrights for usage and changes to its

code, Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) has also become a cultural movement in


Web 2.0. The creation of the operating system code, UNIX, is widely acknowledged as

the first crowdsourced, open software (The Open Group, 2011). Beyond open code, the

cultural side of FOSS is closely tied to the emergence of crowdsourcing as a type of


organizing and management in organizations (Shirky, 2009).

                                                  	  
                                                                                              19


Participatory Epidemiology

        The emerging field in which crowdsourced methodologies for health promotion


are situated is titled participatory epidemiology (Friefeld et al., 2010; Jost, Roeder, &

MacGregor-Skinner, 2007). This field applies fundamentals from the theoretical

foundations of participatory-based community research and participatory action research.

                                        Abstract


Background

       Online tools and platforms are rapidly emerging and evolving, often at a faster

pace than health promotion research or interventions can adapt to them. However, these


technologies are ideal for integrating known successful approaches in the health canon.

Summaries of state of the art online communities and tools and recent research are

required for health professionals to stay abreast of technology.


Objective


       This annotated bibliography aims to provide a thorough but brief overview of the

current state of the art in online tools and platforms that are relevant to health promotion.


Methods


       Through exploring online tools and social platforms and following trends over

time, the authors compiled resources and grouped them by major categories that can

guide health professionals in integrating their work with online communities.



Results

       Findings were grouped into three overarching categories: crowdsourced tools,

eHealth, and participatory epidemiology. Within these groupings, 18 websites and

12 articles and books are summarized and discussed.


                                                 	  
                                                                                            21


Conclusion

        Ongoing efforts are needed to update such lists, which are often out of date by the


time of their publication. Ample opportunities exist for health professionals to engage

technology with traditional approaches, usually with very low programmatic costs.

Health promotion is at the entryway of an exciting new expansion of venues and

applications through Web 2.0 and social computing.



                                        Introduction


        Online tools and platforms emerge and evolve rapidly, often exceeding the pace

of health promotion research on their effectiveness. However, these technologies are


important because they have the potential to enhance the applications and effectiveness of

existing approaches to improving population health and increase the rate of knowledge

sharing and replication of successful approaches. This annotated bibliography provides a


brief overview of the current state of the art in tools and platforms that are relevant to

health promotion to facilitate health professionals in their efforts to synthesize their work

with emerging technologies. Social media, or Internet-based communication platforms,

refer to the way in which Internet users interact with each other and information sources


online. The current era of social media began with a movement known as Web 2.0, in

which websites transitioned from being unidirectional repositories of information from a

single source to hosted online interactions between many different users. Social media


have since emerged as a decentralized form of communication and community

organization that is resistant to attempts to apply a hierarchical management structure

such as government or corporate control. As a result, social media could hold the


potential to reinvent health communication and decrease barriers to obtaining and using

                                                   	  
                                                                                            22


health information, producing flatter (less hierarchical) social networks. Increased access

to information has resulted in empowered patients who seek to be partners in their health,


but has also concerned healthcare providers, who worry that the general public lacks the

medical background or experience needed to assess the quality of the large body of

information now available. Social media have become so pervasive in the global

economy that they have produced new ways of managing businesses, governments, and


organizations, making governance structures less hierarchical and more porous to flows

of information into and out of the institutions. In relation to health, this shift has

increased the capacity of people to directly seek improved health outcomes rather than


being the subjects or targets of intervention. Perhaps the greatest achievement of social

media has been to reduce the disparities in access to knowledge and resources in

impoverished regions and crisis situations caused by natural disasters and conflict. The


mechanisms of this ongoing transformation include new developments in crowdsourcing,

eHealth/mHealth, participatory epidemiology, and platforms for crisis mapping.


                                       Crisis Mapping


        Crisis mapping emerged from the integration of the open-source software


movement, crowdsourcing, and geographic information systems (GIS) with the needs of

disaster management. The craft thrived because of the parallel emergence of short

message service (SMS) mobile phone texting technology and the Web 2.0 cultural


revolution that encouraged interactive management systems and non-centralized, organic

organization of movements and ideas. This was made possible through virtual networks

that dramatically increased connectivity between individuals who were previously


separated by geography and social structures. Crisis mapping tools tend to be organized

                                                   	  
                                                                                             23


into platforms, a term that simply refers to the collection of computer software, online

databases, and methods of communication that allow users to interact with each other.


Crisis mapping was originally created in response to natural disasters, producing an early

platform called Sahana. However, it rose to global awareness with Ushahidi, which was

developed in response to violent conflict. During the disputed and violent 2007 national

elections in Kenya, a group of Kenyan programmers who previously did not know each


other shared a desire to create an online tool that could provide assistance to those whose

lives were being impacted by violence and conflict. This origin strongly influenced the

crisis mapping culture that would follow, as the violent conditions required a level of


security that natural disasters did not. A preference toward centrally-verified field

updates, as opposed to unverified updates, is a key example of this impact. Crisis

mapping depends on individuals in a geographic region to provide data which are


parameterized for the benefit of improved information and response regarding resource

need and allocation. Crisis mappers define their activity as an online community that

collectively “leverage mobile and web-based applications, participatory maps and

crowdsourced event data, aerial and satellite imagery, geospatial platforms, visual


analytics, and computational and statistical models to power effective early warning for

rapid response to complex humanitarian emergencies” (Crisismappers.net 2011). Rogers

(2011) explained that crisis mappers represent a growing cultural evolution of structuring


the management of organizations that are borderless, collaborative, and pervasively

networked. Most aspects of crowdsourced efforts are free and open, from writing the

code of the technology to be deployed to storing the information gathered. As academic






                                                    	  
                                                                                           24


institutions take up crisis mapping, this tradition of open-source and open-access

protocols is not always maintained.



Crisis Mapping Platforms

Sahana [now part of www.sahanafoundation.org]

        The first widely used crisis mapping platform, Sahana was developed in 2004 in

        coordination with IT volunteers, the Lanka Software Foundation, and the Swedish


        International Development Cooperation Agency. The Internet- and software-

        based program was created in response to a perceived need to coordinate

        humanitarian efforts responding to the South Asian tsunami. Its largest


        deployment in Sri Lanka was largely unsuccessful because it predated cloud

        computing, instead requiring installation on computers in NGO and multilateral

        agency offices that were involved in disaster response. However, one of Sahana’s


        stated goals was to empower disaster victims to help themselves, making it an

        important early precursor of the paradigm shift in disaster response that would

        later be apparent in the deployment of the Ushahidi crisis map in Haiti’s 2010

        earthquake.


Ushahidi [www.Ushahidi.com]

        Ushahidi spontaneously formed in 2007, when the Kenyan election threatened the

        country’s political stability. A small group of bloggers and software developers


        combined forces to write a software code for a website that would allow people to

        report incidences of violence by geocoding their text messages and displaying

        them on a website. Based on the Google Earth platform, Ushahidi provides an


        open-sourced, crisis mapping global communication network, deployed on a web-


                                                  	  
                                                                                             25


        and FrontlineSMS-based texting network to coordinate reports of need and

        response. When the January 2010 earthquake occurred in Haiti, a volunteer


        network, already formed for a previous Chile earthquake, simultaneously began

        forming a crisis mapping network to share information on the locations and

        identities of missing persons, health service needs, and the locations of available

        resources on the Ushahidi platform. In contrast to the UN’s hierarchical approach


        with a centralized chain of command, the crowdsource foundation of crisis

        mapping ascribes validity to an increasing sample size as opposed to the source of

        the information in communication and information-gathering (Meier, 2011).


Stand-by Taskforce [blog.standbytaskforce.com]

        The Stand-by Taskforce has established a verification team so that volunteers who

        join in the crowdsourced effort to analyze incoming data can be tasked


        specifically to validation measures. Sources that are authenticated can be tagged

        as trustworthy and sorted accordingly using SwiftRiver.

SwiftRiver [www.ushahidi.com/products/swiftriver-platform]

        In an effort to improve the reliability of information sources, Ushahidi has


        developed the SwiftRiver platform, which sorts information collected through

        various channels, such as twitter or email, by pre-set filters, such as known

        information sources. SwiftRiver also allows for rapid analysis for pattern


        frequency. Incoming messages that share a location and subject, for example, the

        bridge is out, can be raised in priority because of their multiple sources.

                                      Crowdsourcing


        Crowdsourcing is a term originally coined by writer Jeff Howe to mean “the act


of a company or institution taking a function once performed by employees and

outsourcing it to an undefined (and generally large) network of people in the form of an

open call.” This means of organizing follows a series of technological innovations

collectively termed Web 2.0, in which the Internet transitioned from a one-directional


communication platform to a unidirectional interaction platform. Web 2.0 is denoted by

the advent of blogging, microblogging or tweeting, and social media. The explosion of

Internet participation allowed exposure to individuals who share their interests that might


have previously seemed obscure, due to geographic distances and other factors that

separated them. Micro-celebrity emerged as a kind of high-profile popularity one could

gain in unique circles of interests online. One important function of micro-celebrity is its


encouragement of collaboration and achievement in crowdsourced endeavors. A small

number of writers has emerged as thought leaders in this still emerging field.

        In this 2006 article on an emerging business trend, Howe officially coined the

        term crowdsourcing as a portmanteau of the words outsourcing and crowd. The

        article included the case study of Innocentive, which epitomizes the trend’s


        impact on health, as it crowdsourced its R&D for pharmaceutical development

        with open calls paying $10,000-$100,000 to hobbyists who come up with

        solutions to previously-unsolvable hurdles.

        traced the origins of crowdsourcing to the open source movement in software,

        with more in-depth case studies including the creation of Linux and

        SETI@Home, a crowdsourced attempt to find extra-terrestrial life. Howe


        explored why people participate in crowdsourced endeavors even when financial

        gain is not an outcome, i.e., for the enjoyment of collaborating. Howe also

        explained that the concept of the dilettante and its connotation have become


        negative since industrialization ushered in an age of specialization; however, most

        of the great advances in the Enlightenment were made by people dabbling in

        fields other than their primary occupation or specialization. Crowdsourcing


        returns civilization to an ability to harness the mental power of dabbling.

        management is primarily marked by the absence or presence of layers between the


        boss, the product, and the target audience.

        Howe’s notion of powerful dabbling was further developed in Clay Shirky’s

        book, which termed the otherwise wasted abilities of people who only focus on

        their narrow field of work cognitive surplus. Shirky claimed 50 years of television

        masked cognitive surplus because one’s interests could be pacified during leisure-


        time hours by watching TV. However, the new media, especially the hyper-

        interactive Web 2.0, has allowed people easy access to opportunities to re-engage

        their minds during leisure-time hours. The book is replete with case studies of


        impressive endeavors accomplished by the crowd.

                                   eHealth and mHealth


        As terms, eHealth and mHealth exemplify the terminology that demarcates most

literature regarding social media applications to health improvement from more


traditional approaches. A new jargon has arisen, largely based on combining words into

portmanteaus—a functional consequence of communicating with URL addresses, which

cannot include spaces, for titles or terms. eHealth was originally the term used to describe


help-seeking individuals or health providers who made use of the Internet, while mHealth

referred to the seeking of health information or providing healthcare services using a

mobile device. Given the rapid growth of mobile devices in Internet-based

communications—mobile devices (with approximately 1 billion of these being


smartphones) now outnumber humans on the planet—the term eHealth has been eclipsed

as the more common means of referring to the integration of the Internet with health

access and provision. In terms of population and funding, the greatest growth in mHealth


has taken place in low- and middle-income countries, where access to and use of mobile

devices continues to rapidly outpace the physical infrastructures of medical clinics and

laboratories that traditional health care provision relies upon. Peer-reviewed monitoring


and evaluation of mHealth practices have lagged behind the pace of intervention and, as a

                                                   	  
                                                                                              30


result, little is currently known about best practices for integrating traditional health with

emerging technological platforms.


        A common cause of program failure is to apply a traditional health approach

directly over mobile devices without embracing the cultural shift of participatory

interaction that marks the mobile user interface. The health and medical fields are thus

now faced with a paradigm shift away from being the sole providers of health


information to being facilitators in a patient-initiated process of navigating health

information. This paradigm shift has coalesced in the academic literature under the term

participatory epidemiology. Once considered patients, individuals seeking information or


guidance about health issues are now perhaps more accurately conceptualized as

curators—providing, editing, seeking, and sharing information about health. The increase

in access to online information made possible by now-ubiquitous mobile devices has had


a profound impact on the way the public finds, evaluates, and uses health information.

People can access health research that was once only available to universities, hospitals,

and professionals. The ability to acquire information directly, rather than relying on

topical health books or physicians and other professionals to filter the information for


them, coupled with the ease of forming communities online, lead to numerous social

groups formed by people with similar conditions, symptoms, and diagnoses. Participatory

health-based interactions can be very well organized and documented, as in Wikipedia


articles, or completely informal, as in Quora questions.

                         Participatory and Digital Epidemiology


        Participatory epidemiology is a newly emerged, rapidly growing field with


profound implications for public health. Based on the technological advances and

paradigm shifts inherent in Web 2.0, participatory epidemiology is a public health

approach that engages public collaboration in non-hierarchical methodologies. Given that


approximately three quarters of the seven billion people living on the planet have access

to mobile devices, the advent of health programming over mobile devices is significantly

shaping the future of public health. The field has its theoretical roots in community-based

participatory research and participatory action research, two areas of public health that


also sought more egalitarian methodologies for developing health interventions. The field

is largely dedicated to free and open source (FOSS) values, which shun domains and

ownerships in process planning and communication of results. Because of the reduced


cost of interacting with large numbers of participants over technological platforms,

participatory methodologies are ideal for health programs with limited resources.

rinderpest across African countries with qualitative interviews, as opposed to the more

widely used approach of quantified reports and analysis. The World Organization for


Animal Health now recognizes this methodology as participatory animal surveillance.

Within the field of public health, participatory epidemiology was first widely applied by

Freifeld et al. (2010) in a review of mobile phone-based applications to community-level

health problems. Recent conferences have also used the term digital epidemiology. The


largest such event is the annual Conference on Digital Disease Detection, hosted at the

University of San Francisco and co-hosted by HealthMap.org. The most literal

application of participatory methods for epidemiological use occurred in 2007, when


Google researchers collaborated with epidemiologists at the Centers for Disease Control

to document the successful use of Google analytic investigations for the surveillance of

seasonal flu. The resulting website, Google Flu Trends, raised awareness in the health


community about emerging applications of participatory data sources to health

surveillance. Building on that success, Google launched Google.org, a philanthropic

constellation of participatory epidemiological platforms, including Google Flu Trends

and Google Crisis Response. In 2011, the United Nations launched a new agency,


UN Global Pulse, dedicated to more participatory means of monitoring and evaluation for

health and well-being. The agency recently conducted a five-country effort to

crowdsource data collection over mobile phones that investigated how vulnerable


populations are coping with the economic crisis, the results of which are forthcoming.

health promotion and public health, especially in the case of emergencies, such as

disaster management or government-provided health services. Legal precedents from


analog health service provision may be held to digital health services. For example, when

the government provides health services such as 911 emergency response, it can be held

legally liable for not responding to every call. It remains to be tested if government


responses to information shared digitally on social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter,

etc.) or email will also be held to this standard.

        inadequate response. Recommendations to address this include backup processing

        systems, regulation that addresses these instances, and organizational protocols.

        order to establish integration of new technologies and to leverage available

        technology and information.

        situation that if a text message is sent, people assume it has been read and expect

        help. Sites should put a blanket statement up when they are not monitoring and

        send automatic texts that say their text may not be read and a response is not

        This article was written by renowned crisis mapping expert, Patrick Meier. The

        author reviews data protection standards developed by humanitarian organizations

        and finds no reference to social media. The author noted that the majority of crisis


        maps are launched by individuals, not humanitarian organizations and, therefore,

        while appropriate guidelines for crisis mapping need to be put in place, it will not

        be possible for them to be globally enforced or to ensure that every mapper abides


        by them.

        appropriate to the sensitivity of the information must be in place prior to any

        protection, actors should endeavor (when appropriate and feasible) to share


        aggregated data on the trends observed; and to the degree possible, protection

        actors should keep the victims and/or communities who have transmitted the

        information on abuses and violations informed of the action they have taken on


        their behalf and of the ensuing results.

        This article analyzes the case of Lauren Rosenberg vs. Google. Rosenberg sued

        the company when she was injured using a Google Maps route. The court found


        that Google was not liable because it did not owe any “special duty” to

        Rosenberg. The findings can be applied to a broad range of digital media. Though

        Rosenberg argued that Google was not a mass market producer but a service


        provider, the courts relied on the legal precedent that said mass-market book

        publishers owe no duty to their readers to ensure that all content in their books is

        accurate. They categorized Google as a mass market product and, as such, errors

        are considered inevitable. The court also noted that the user will always be


        considered in the best position to apply Internet-provided data to real-world

        conditions.

                   CRISIS MAPPING: A VALUABLE NEW TOOL

               IN RESPONDING TO A PUBLIC HEALTH DISASTER?




                                        Abstract


Background

       The earthquake that struck Haiti on January 12, 2010 resulted in a humanitarian


and public health disaster of catastrophic proportions. Multilateral and non-governmental

organizations responded with a crisis management system known as a Cluster Response.

In addition, Ushahidi, an open-sourced, online crisis mapping global communication

network based on SMS texts, was deployed to coordinate reports of need and response.


Ushahidi was not considered to be part of the Cluster Response.


Objective

       To document the successes and failures of crisis mapping for disaster response.



Methods

       Utilizing a rapid assessment qualitative evaluation methodology, 21 interviews

were conducted with key stakeholders involved in the Cluster Response and crisis


mapping responses during the Haiti disaster. Responses were coded and ordered by

frequency to identify prominent themes that defined the case study. The SMS messages

were analyzed based on the frequency over time of the coding of particular topics. An



                                                	  
                                                                                            46


algorithm was developed to search messages for the occurrence of certain keywords

associated with one of the categories that were being manually applied by the crisis


mapping volunteers. Results of the machine-coding algorithm in four major categories of

need were compared to the manually-assigned categories.


Results

        Initial hostility between the two principal entities prohibited the maximizing of


available resources and the dissemination of information. However, by the second wave

of the disaster, marked by the cholera epidemic, the Cluster organizations had largely

accepted the value of crisis mapping. Consequently, it was soon adopted as a valuable in-


house tool. The quantitative analysis in this study revealed that needs shifted over time.

Initially, emergency requests were prominent. After the first few weeks of the disaster,

food, water, and supply shortages supplanted the need for emergency help, eventually


accounting for 81% of all messages. The machine-coding algorithm tracked closely with

manually-coded results for water shortages and security needs. The algorithm also

detected many more messages about fuel shortages and chronic health needs than the

volunteer coding effort identified, thus adding great value to the response effort.



Conclusion

        There is increased potential for managing large-scale public health disasters with

additional information gained through crisis mapping and other emerging technologies


for rapid analysis. The analysis of codes revealed the extent to which the crisis map SMS

messages might have been used to inform a situational analysis of the crisis. As future

technologies become available for disaster response, the Haiti earthquake remains an


important case study for the diffusion of innovations in the Cluster Response.

                                        Introduction


        At 4:52 p.m. on January 12, 2010, an earthquake of the magnitude of 7.0 occurred


in Haiti. It caused the worst natural disaster ever recorded in the western hemisphere.

Haitian officials estimate that over 316,000 people lost their lives and more than 300,000

were seriously injured (Bilham, 2010; Kolbe et al., 2010).

        The cataclysmic nature of the damage and especially the loss of infrastructure


such as roads, ports, and airports made the first days of disaster response difficult. While

the capital of Port-au-Prince was flooded with multilateral and non-governmental

agencies’ aid workers, a lack of communication among them resulted in poor


coordination of the services they struggled to provide. The United Nations (UN)

immediately implemented the Cluster Response, based on UN General Assembly

resolution 46/182 (United Nations, 1991), which calls for grouping all the agencies and


organizations working within a sector, such as health or security, into clusters with a

single point of contact for the response effort and appeals to donors. This management

system designates one agency as the lead for each sector and determines which NGOs

should act in which official capacities.


        In accordance with procedures within the Cluster Response, a committee was

convened to conduct a post-disaster needs assessment (PDNA) to determine the planning

and spending priorities for recovery efforts in future intervals of 6 and 18 months, then


3 and 10 years (Haiti PDNA, 2010). The committee began their investigation on February

18, 2010 and concluded with the report’s public release on March 24, 2010.

        Concurrent with this formal response from the UN, a global movement of


volunteer responders also initiated a response (Heinzelman & Waters, 2010). Within four


                                                   	  
                                                                                            48


hours of the earthquake, Patrick Meier, his colleagues at Ushahidi, and his fellow

graduate students at Tufts University launched a crisis map. They soon began receiving


messages, translating them, coding them by type and actionable need they communicated,

and mapping them on a publically-accessible crisis map online. The team secured a

shortcode phone number, which went active on January 16, 2010 (Meier, 2012). This

made it possible to send SMS messages from a Haitian mobile phone free of charge


(Project 4636, 2010). NGO workers quickly used the system to coordinate with other

NGOs. In an early news conference, Hillary Clinton recognized the crisis mappers,

saying, “The technology community has set up interactive maps to help us identify needs


and target resources” (Clinton, 2010). Earthquake victims communicated urgent needs

such as the specific locations in which they were trapped in rubble. Additionally, the

global public communicated their search for missing loved ones. By January 18, 2010,


local radio stations, the main source of information for most Haitians, began broadcasting

information on the crisis map (Nelson, 2010).

        Crisis mapping originated several years prior to the Haitian earthquake. Volunteer

and crowdsourced communities spontaneously responded to catastrophic events such as


the Asian Tsunami in 2004 and the Kenyan election violence of 2007 (Meier & Munro,

2010). Crisis mappers defined their activity as that of an online community which

collectively “leveraged mobile and web-based applications, participatory maps and


crowd-sourced event data, aerial and satellite imagery, geospatial platforms, visual

analytics, and computational and statistical models to power an effective early warning

for rapid response to complex humanitarian emergencies” (Crisismappers.net, 2011).






                                                   	  
                                                                                            49


        The cultural phenomenon of Web 2.0 resulted in more opportunities for

interaction and more technological solutions to elevate interactions in more meaningful


ways (Nelson, 2010; O’Reilly, 2005). Within a week of the disaster, a self-organized,

global team of over 2,000 volunteers was actively coordinating communications related

to earthquake relief. Despite this large number of volunteers, Ushahidi’s Patrick Meier

and other crisis mapping leadership turned down the opportunity to send a text message


to every mobile phone subscriber in the country, inviting them to engage the crisis map

communication system—because they feared their volunteer force was not big enough to

handle a massive onslaught of incoming messages, each requiring translation and


geocoding (Heinzelman & Waters, 2010).

        In the three years since the Haiti earthquake, crisis mapping quickly diffused

through the UN as an emerging innovation, to the degree that UN agencies now employ


in-house teams that create and manage their own crisis maps. However, meaningful

evaluation of how to best use the crowdsourced information has not kept pace with the

technology’s rapid uptake (Reyes, Laredo, & Vukovic, 2010).

        This study was motivated by the potential for crisis mapping to be used to


augment or even replace the traditional rapid assessment of need in a region impacted by

an enormous natural disaster. Findings indicated that existing crisis map procedures can

be improved with automated coding, which is faster, requires less manpower, and is often


more accurate that human coding. The needs communicated in the Haiti crisis map were

valid reflections of those found by the traditional assessment tools, but were also

available to responders in near real-time rather than months after the event.

Qualitative Methods


        This qualitative investigation was guided by the question of whether the

introduction of these novel technologies and their rapid diffusion lead to changes in

communication structures among organizations and between organizations and the

populations they exist to serve. Further, were there features that changed the rate of


diffusion that could be scaled or transferred to other situations when new technologies

become available?

        A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods was used to evaluate crisis


mapping as a rapid response tool for disaster relief. First, key informants were identified

through online blogs, twitter conversations, three early reports on crisis mapping, and the

volunteer effort conducted by the UN (Crowly, 2010; Nelson, 2010; Ushahidi, 2011). Of


the 20 individuals identified, 15 agreed to be interviewed. At the conclusion of each

interview, participants were asked to identify other key informants that could provide a

more complete understanding of the issues involved. This snowball sampling added 6

additional people, for a total of 21 interviews. These people represented multilateral


organizations and the volunteer crisis mapping community (see Table 1). Participants

representing multilateral organizations worked for United Nations agencies, the World

Bank, and major NGOs. Members of the volunteer crisis mapping community were all


U.S.-based and were primarily active in coding and geocoding incoming messages for

inclusion to the map. While participants from multilateral organizations tended to be

above the age of 41, most of the crisis mapping volunteers were younger than 41.

       The interview structure was adapted from the Rapid Assessment Model developed


by Bolton, Wilk, and Ndogoni (2003). For this study, this qualitative evaluation

procedure utilized semi-structured interviews. It also produced a coded evaluation of the

sum total of the interviews. All interviews took place between May and August, 2011.


Each individual was asked a series of open-ended questions. After each question, the

person was prompted to make additional comments. The aim of exhausting the subject

was to avoid gathering only the information that came quickly to mind, perhaps due to

recent events or experiences.


       When all interviews were completed, each topic raised in the responses was listed

and ordered by frequency among all of the participants, regardless of the question that

produced that response. The five most frequently mentioned topics were assigned to


represent the most important areas of focus for the creation of the case study.

Quantitative Methods

        Ushahidi, the organization hosting the crisis map online for the first three months,


maintained the database of SMS messages. All originating phone numbers were removed.

These were located in an open source, downloadable file attached to the map. IRB

approval was obtained to analyze the database that included 3,589 messages sent between

January 12 and April 27, 2010. This study does not include messages sent after this date.


Nor does it include messages managed by Noula, an organization created to be the

sustainable, ongoing crisis map that is still in use today in Haiti.

        Quantitative analysis focused on the labels with which SMS messages were coded


by volunteers. The message date, text, and assigned labels were imported into the

statistical software package R (version 2.14.2). The label column was parsed to form

individual factors for each of the 49 possible labels, indicating whether or not a particular


message received each label. Some messages received multiple labels.

        To compare the manually coded labels of the crisis mapping volunteers to an

automated computer process, the text of each message was parsed for a set of keywords

that would be associated with certain manually coded labels. For example, the category


water shortage was approximated by any messages that contained the words water, drink,

and thirst. Fuel shortage was approximated by the key words fuel, diesel, and gas.

Security threats used the words police, gun, robber, and loot. “Chronic care needs” were


approximated by diabete (to include diabetic and diabetes), insulin, and medication. The

machine-coded messages were compared with the volunteer-coded messages, creating

two-by-two tables of counts for each category.

                                            Results


Qualitative Results


        All interviews were coded by topics they raised and ranked for topic frequency.

The top five topics were summarized below and as these topics were discussed by

multiple respondents, common themes were identified. The most frequent topics raised in

the responses and the context in which they were made are delineated below.


        1. There was a limited ability to use the information gathered to directly

interact with the Haitians who provided it.

        Ideally, crisis mapping is intended to generate a feedback loop. Individuals send


an SMS such as “this neighborhood has a water shortage,” information regarding the

location and nature of the report. It is then communicated through a virtual map in which

an aid worker has the ability to respond to that location. However, neither the aid


managers nor the crisis mappers felt integration was sufficient to communicate back to

the sender or even follow up with the sender at a later time. As opposed to using the

system to respond to those in need, most NGOs used it instead to share information about

their own needs to those in other affiliated organizations. This is illustrated in this SMS:


          U.S. established an air link to the airport after fixing the traffic control tower.
        Will send - over multiple shipments - enough food for 1.2 million people over 2
        weeks, specifically 14,550 tons of food (7k rice, 4,500 corn-soy blend, 3k
        vegetable oil) to be distributed by UN and private orgs.


        In the weeks after the earthquake, aid workers realized that the radio was the most

valued source of information for many Haitians. Information gathered for the crisis maps

became increasingly communicated over health-oriented radio programs, such as one

established by Mission 4636 (Munro, 2012). Although the crisis map was available in


both Haitian Creole and English, it was only accessible on computers. No interface was

                                                    	  
                                                                                             54


possible for mobile phones. This created an absence of feedback mechanisms that was

seen as the primary reason why more reports did not come from earthquake victims


themselves. These people did not have access to the texted reports and most did not hear

back from anyone after sending a report.

        2. UN and other official entities were reticent to use the information gathered

because they: a) were uncomfortable posting information online, and b) distrusted


the validity of the information posted by others.

        In the years leading up to earthquake in Haiti, the interviewed UN employees

claimed they worried that creating Twitter accounts or being active in social media would


result in termination of their employment. At that time, there was a growing concern that

posting work-related information would be perceived as inappropriate, primarily due to

privacy regulations. Similarly, UN officials were well aware that false information had


been intentionally spread during previous emergency response situations. For instance,

during the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India, government agencies and media

obtained much of their information from tweets as the terrible events unfolded. At one

point, the gunmen discovered this and began sending out false tweets. As a result, many


UN managers grew to distrust the use of tweeted information in crisis situations.

Consequently, very little fluency existed in the technologies the crisis mappers

represented.


        Volunteers tended to counter the issue of validity by raising the point that

information is so severely limited following a natural disaster, that even if those data

gathered through text messages are not fully representative of the population, it is an


improvement over the alternative of no data. Sewell (2011) studied the crisis mappers’



                                                    	  
                                                                                             55


response for her master’s thesis after herself participating as a volunteer with the Tufts

University team. Paraphrasing a paper by Gonzales (2008), she explained that despite


concerns around validity, crisis mapping filled a hole in disaster response such that:

          communication and situational awareness are manifestations of a need for
        intelligence because without timely and accurate information, decision making
        and action can be stymied. The scope of each organization is limited and as such,
        they are dependent on the information as well as the ability of other organizations
        to deliver it.


        3. The discord that marked the initial stages of relief in Haiti was largely

resolved by the time of the second wave crisis, the cholera epidemic.

        The UN agencies representing the Cluster Response did not immediately adopt


crisis mapping as an information resource, as clearly demonstrated in the UN report

Disaster 2.0 (Crowley & Chan, 2011). The report referred to the crisis mapping

community as being “interlopers” who expected UN responders to answer their emails


when they were already overburdened with routine post-disaster tasks (Crowley & Chan,

2011).

        In October 2010, Harvard and Tufts Universities hosted an international

conference on crisis mapping that included many stakeholders in the global volunteer


crisis mapping community. Also attending were representatives from the UN agencies

involved in Haiti. The event turned into a catalytic change agent, where members from

each community could learn about one another and discuss strategy integration. Within


months of the conference, participants from the UN agencies claimed to have organized

in-house crisis map teams.

        In addition to integrating crisis mapping, UN agencies began to break their silence


in social media platforms, embracing Internet communications and technologies (ICT)



                                                    	  
                                                                                            56


and launching agendas that were centered online. UN managers working with multilateral

organizations rapidly integrated social media platforms into their communication


strategies both internally and externally. Rather than relying on stand-alone

communication departments to represent them online, departments now have

communication managers. Additionally, employees are now encouraged to be active on

social media platforms.


        4. The geographic location of the “pipeline” or Internet data source was of

critical influence.

        With the communications infrastructure of Port-au-Prince demolished by the


earthquake, Google Voice, Twitter, and other online tools became the only means of

communication. One of the interview participants was a graduate student who led

Columbia University’s team of crisis mappers. He explained that many NGOs, including


Ushahidi, were set up in the central city, very near the pipeline that provided Internet

access. However, the UN cluster agencies established their base of operations outside of

town which was too far from the pipeline to receive connectivity. This fact contributed to

the lack of integration of ICT within the UN agencies. Crowley and Chan (2011)


conducted an interview for their report, Disaster 2.0, that explained the pipeline access

Cluster agencies did come with a cost dimension: “During the ﬁrst 2 weeks of a major

disaster, like Haiti, even though we had connectivity, we [did] not have the luxury of


accessing the graphical web, at $6-8/MB for data. And you load a Facebook page, with

photos/status page, that is 300-400KB. It quickly adds up.”

        Nelson, Sigal, and Zambrano (2011) discussed the lone role and particular


effectiveness of Colonel Lee Harvis, Joint Special Operations Air Component Surgeon



                                                   	  
                                                                                             57


for the U.S. Navy. As the top military medical officer, Colonel Harvis excelled at

integrating online communication platforms into disaster management while situated near


the pipeline. The team reported that Colonel Harvis was frustrated by his inability to find

or delivery critical services. In an email interview, he explained, “That first day, we spent

two hours—actually longer—searching for the Israeli hospital and my medics never

found it.” Independent of the crisis mappers’ response efforts, Colonel Harvis began


using his mobile phone on the back of a motorcycle to mark coordinates of roads for

supply delivery. Because the management infrastructure of the shipyards and airports

were both destroyed, incoming aircraft with aid and supplies were not able to land and


ships were not able to dock until the facilities were repaired. Ultimately, through the

work of Colonel Harvis and others, improved maps did help the greater effort of

geolocating place names and delivering services.


        Tasked with restoring infrastructure, Colonel Harvis utilized Google Voice to

communicate with airplanes and ships. Once this task was accomplished, he further used

crisis maps to orchestrate the evacuation of severely injured individuals from clinics and

hospitals on land to the floating Navy hospital USNS Comfort.


        Other collaborations to improve mapping and geocoding effectiveness included

the collaboration between two private partners, GeoEye and Google, who “released high-

resolution imagery of the disaster 26 hours after the quake. Digital Globe soon followed.


What was remarkable was that these providers released the imagery under an ‘attribution

only’ license, instead of the usual restrictive licenses that prevent derived works and

redistribution via other online and ofﬂine channels” (Crowley & Chan, 2011).






                                                    	  
                                                                                             58


        5. The shifting paradigm of external organizations involved in the

earthquake was a causal force in the differing approaches to disaster management.


        Web 2.0 was not merely a revolution in social media online. It was the result of an

evolution in management structures that redefined the financial cost of work (Rogers,

2011). This new era is marked by the emergence of highly participatory organizational

structures. These structures are marked by collapsed levels of hierarchy, inclusively


defined membership, and reduced transaction costs because of an efficient use of

otherwise-wasted cognitive surplus. This often pertained to highly technical tasks

conducted by individuals with unique skill sets, but who often worked in other fields


(Shirky, 2008). Thus, the paradigm of traditional hierarchical response of disaster

management entities was opposed. This stands in contrast to the cultural structure of the

crisis mapping organizations and their thousands of crowdsourced volunteers.


        During the interviews, a high ranking UN official explained how the UN has

adapted since then. The culture shift is especially notable in creating its newest agency in

response to the need for faster and more porous data flows, UN Global Pulse, “to get a

real time indication of the level of stress on populations. We are looking for real time


evidence of changes in collective behavior that tell us where we need to ask more

questions.” In explaining how this change in policy has a potential to impact other agency

directives, he explained, “If we can learn to detect crisis-driven decreases in human


wellbeing, we can also detect the opposite—the evidence that people’s lives are

improving. This type of evidence is no less important for leaders to gain access to, as it

lets them do more of what is working well.”






                                                    	  
                                                                                           59


Quantitative Results

        Crisis mapping volunteer coding analysis. A total of 3,587 individual messages


were included in the analysis and 7,307 individual codes were applied. Most messages

received either one or two categories. However, over 1,000 messages received three or

more codes (Figure 1). The total number of codes assigned for each category and the

percentage (based on the total number of messages) are provided in Table 2. Although


the codes are organized by general thematic codes with related sub-codes, the system

permitted a user to add the general code without specifying a sub-code. For example, the

general “Emergency” code could be used without specifying the type of emergency, such


as “People Trapped or Fire.”

        Food Shortage (44%) and Water Shortage (37%) were the most commonly

assigned codes, followed by the general Vital Lines (14%) and Emergency categories


(13%) and Shelter Needed (13%). The codes for Medical Emergency, People Trapped,

Medical Equipment and Supply Needs, Services Available, Food Distribution Point,

Hospital Clinics Operating, and Persons News were used in between 5% and 10% of

messages. The remaining codes were used for less than 5% of the messages.


        In the first 10 days after the disaster, most messages were focused on emergency

situations and the availability of services (Figure 2). The introduction of the Mission

4636 shortcode on January 16 coincided with an across the board increase in frequency of


all types of messages. By January 22 (10 days after the earthquake), the number of

emergency reports began to decline while shortages of water, food, shelter, and medical

equipment began to increase. These shortages peaked on January 23, declined, and then a


smaller sustained increase was recorded over the first two weeks of February.

        Machine coding. The machine-coded labels closely tracked the volunteer-coded

labels for the Water Shortage category (Figure 3a). This indicates a large spike in this


need that occurred from January 20-25 and another smaller increase over the first two

weeks of February. Security concerns (Figure 3b) determined by machine coding also

closely followed the labels added by volunteers, detecting spikes on January 17 and

January 24. The Fuel Shortage and Chronic Care Needs (Figures 3c and 3d) labels were


seldom used by the volunteer coders. However, the machine coding algorithm detected

many messages related to these needs. Overall, 74 Fuel Shortage messages were labeled

by machine coding, compared with 21 by volunteer coding. Similarly, 65 Chronic Care


Needs were labeled by the algorithm while only two were found by volunteer coding.

These findings illustrate that a machine coding algorithm can be useful to track the

relative intensity of particular needs over time, but also to identify very specific needs


that might be missed by volunteer coding. One reason that the volunteer coding effort

appeared to miss important actionable information such as the need for insulin or fuel for

generators is that these messages often expressed other needs as well, such as food and

water, which caused them to be identified with these categories. Computer algorithms can


easily parse longer messages that express multiple needs at once, automatically delivering

them to the appropriate cluster or local volunteers.

        The 2010 Haiti earthquake gathered together a unique group of global actors. It


will be remembered for the change it affected in the way the world responds to crisis.

Before the earthquake, crisis mappers and UN agencies were disparate entities, but within

a year of the disaster, these two units were deeply intertwined. This evaluation helps shed

light that a cultural evolution occurred in the UN, an entity which has traditionally been


resistant to rapid changes. Further, it illustrates that crisis mapping could be even more

valuable in future disaster response.


Crisis Mapping’s Diffusion Through UN Agencies


        Rogers’ (1953) Theory of Diffusion of Innovations can be used to explain the

stages social networks undergo when adopting a new idea or technology. Rogers

contended that when a new technology or innovation is introduced to a social network, it


is expected to pass through an S-shaped curve. This curve ranges from initial rejection, to

a critical mass of acceptance, then finally to all but laggards in the network accepting the

idea. The speed of an innovation’s passage through this process depends on factors such

as the presence of change agents or boundary spanners (Burt, 2001; Williams, 2002).


These are individuals who share both the characteristics of the new innovation and those

of the group to which the innovation is introduced. Kapuku (2006) showed that boundary

spanners are especially important for organizations in natural disaster response because


they connect the closed network of an organization to external networks, and hence enact

the porous sharing of information beyond boundaries.

        Conceptually, crisis mapping was a new technology. It diffused quickly through


the multilateral organizations from the social network’s initial hostile response to, within

                                                    	  
                                                                                            67


10 months, complete acceptance. Soon after, it was adopted as a technological innovation

with in-house crisis mapping teams within UN agencies. One explanation for the


adaptation of this new technology occurring more rapidly than expected is a higher

number of in-group individuals who had familiarity with key tools. Mobile phone

texting/SMS could introduce it without the hostility that the out-group would cause.

These technologies have infused themselves into our normal lives and this facilitates


users’ openness to the value phones can bring to other situations.

        As shown in interviews, Web 2.0 was a larger cultural event than crisis mapping

or communicating through SMS. During this period of time, leadership in multilateral


organizations began to change in response to this shift—for example, to integrate border

spanning flows of information such as social media; to engage their target audiences as

partners with fewer layers of hierarchy between agency and recipient of aid. Especially


within UN agencies, their engagement with crisis mapping in the Haitian Earthquake

disaster response was a watershed moment. Regardless of the effectiveness of the

approach, its potential was demonstrated on a large scale.


Mission 4636


        The availability of the free shortcode for sending local SMS messages was critical

to the success of the crisis map. The shortcode resulted in an increase in the number of

messages sent and an increase in messages sent by earthquake survivors (data/volume


increase), as opposed to relief responders.


The Potential for Crisis Maps to Inform Situational Awareness

        While crisis mapping is known for the maps generated, coding messages for rapid


response and situational awareness is arguably their greatest benefit in natural disaster

                                                   	  
                                                                                           68


response. However, responders have yet to use emerging data analysis tools for real time

awareness of needs and events.


        Machine coding offers the potential to increase the capacity load of coding

messages. This has the benefit of decreasing response time and standardizing the biases

that coders may have, such as prioritizing messages that they themselves deem most

important. For example, in this dataset, volunteers employed the code for security


disproportionately often, and underused the code for chronic illness needs—perhaps due

to the news coverage at that time that covered security issues most.


Coding SMS Messages


        The Ushahidi-lead volunteer crisis mappers spent much of their time coding

messages by various labels. In interviews, one participant explained that the number of

labels made available to volunteers was limited only by the number of available fields


written into the report interface of Ushahidi’s software HTML code. Another participant

reported that the labels themselves were chosen by UN OCHA in Colombia months

before the earthquake. This occurred when they hosted a conference on Ushahidi’s crisis

mapping software.


        By analyzing the frequency of labels used over time, certain patterns emerged that

could be considered predictable for disaster response. For example, the earliest messages

were predominantly emergency response oriented, with people looking for their missing


loved ones. These messages gave way after the first week to strong trends in food and

water shortages. In future disasters, knowledge of “normal” label patterns over time could

inform the system to detect anomalies in need.





                                                   	  
                                                                                            69


        The use of labels to quickly gather information from the crisis map would be

greatly improved by policy changes. Limiting messages to two labels and limiting total


possible labels to choose from to a smaller list would increase the detection capacity of

the database. The labels themselves, however, may become entirely unnecessary, given

advances in auto-generated searches. By running the messages through a simple machine-

generated sorting mechanism, the authors were able to create a labeling scheme that was


at least as sensitive as the human coders and, in most cases, superior at detecting need.

The most dramatic example was for chronic health needs, which human coders only

labeled for 2 messages, while machine coding selected for 61 messages. Addressing


chronic care needs for populations dependent on medications or regular medical

treatments is a growing area of concern in post-disaster recovery (Fernandez, Byard, Lin,

Benson, & Barbera, 2002; Jhung et al., 2007; Miller & Arquilla, 2008).


        Among the greatest potential for improvement with crisis mapping is the

advances in data analytics. An example of the opportunities for epidemiological uses of

machine coding emerged in a retrospective analysis of data regarding cholera. In October

2010, the United Nations detected a cholera epidemic in Haiti, which, three years later,


continues to be the worst cholera outbreak on the planet (Adams, 2013). By conducting

machine analysis of informal sources including news reports, twitter, and SMS messages,

a team of researchers found they could detect the epidemic up to two weeks earlier than


traditional epidemiological detection methods (Chunara, Andrews, & Brownstein, 2012).

        Machine coding could engage in a communication network with the participants

who send messages. For example, an individual who sends an SMS that appears to be


communicating a water shortage could then receive an SMS from the crisis map saying,



                                                   	  
                                                                                          70


“You appear to be communicating a need for water. Is this correct?” Or alternatively,

messages that arrive without embedded geocodes could automatically receive a reply that


asks the sender to describe where they are located. Given that the most time-intensive

tasks of the volunteers were translating, coding, and geocoding messages, this would

increase their capacity to clean messages the coding machine could not read.

SOCIAL NETWORK THEORY AS A CONCEPTUAL MODEL FOR HELP-SEEKING

       BEHAVIOR: A CASE STUDY FROM THE 2010 HAITI EARTHQUAKE




                                        Abstract

Background


       Without question, the 2010 Haiti earthquake was an unprecedented natural

disaster. The devastation and difficulties it posed for responders was massive. After

rescue efforts began, crisis mapping and crowdsourced volunteer technical relief emerged


as viable communication and assessment tools. The Haitian public and relief

organizations sent SMS (Short Message Service) messages to a free shortcode, which

became a crisis map to display situational awareness for the public and relief responders.


This study provides an analysis of the public and official use of the Haiti crisis map.


Methods

       An analysis of the database of SMS messages sent during the first three months


after the earthquake was undertaken. Of particular note were indicators of social capital

node types of bonding, bridging, or linking. For this analysis, bonding refers to

relationships marked by likeness; bridging refers to relationships marked by differences;


and linking refers to relationships with a vertical hierarchy, usually a dyad between an

individual and a perceived authority. Each message was coded by the type of sender and

the apparent intended recipient, namely, earthquake survivors or official relief



                                                	  
                                                                                            75


responders. Also coded was the type of information communicated, specifically requests

for help and supplies or location.



Results

        The vast majority (82%) of messages were sent by earthquake victims who were

attempting to communicate their specific needs. These were usually for food, water

(70%), and other supplies requested for a specific location. Patterns in these messages


tended to match the changing nature of the disaster. For example, most early messages

requested assistance in finding or unearthing people. Later messages focused on supply

needs such as food and water.



Conclusion

        Historically, after a natural disaster, reaching individuals in impoverished and

tightly bonded communities has been a formidable challenge. This has most often been


due to technical limitations and the difficulty of facilitating an adequate level of trust

within a limited amount of time. As illustrated in past instances, socially vulnerable

communities often discourage formal means of outside assistance. To help remedy this

situation, the incorporation of crisis maps with geocoded mobile phone SMS message


submissions are employed. This process changes the directionality of communication to

help those in immediate need feel more confident in seeking aid from unfamiliar formal

institutions and non-governmental organizations.


        When responders become less hierarchical, crisis maps present an opportunity for

increased engagement with a vulnerable population. The disaster response in Haiti did

offer an adequate roadmap to use this new technology for more effective communication.


However, the official help-providing entities did not use the crisis map to communicate

                                                   	  
                                                                                           76


directly with the public. Instead, they used it to communicate with one another. Ways to

avoid this unfortunate result warrant attention since the disaster response community


considers the future use of crisis maps valuable in impacting socially vulnerable

populations.


                                        Background


        On January 12, 2010, a 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck Haiti. This natural


disaster has been considered to be the worst recorded in the western hemisphere. It

resulted in at least 300,000 deaths and another 300,000 injuries (Bilham, 2010). Largely

due to a catastrophic loss of urban infrastructure, immediate situational awareness was


extremely limited (Kolbe et al., 2010). This, in turn, impeded the coordination of the

relief response efforts (Nelson, Sigal, & Zambrano, 2011). Crisis mapping, a new

innovation, emerged as a uniquely apt source of information for both earthquake


survivors and official relief providers. This included the many agencies of the United

Nations (Crowley & Chan, 2011; Meier & Munro, 2010).


Crisis Mapping

        Crisis mappers define themselves as an online community that


        collectively, leverage mobile and web-based applications, participatory maps and
        crowd sourced event data, aerial and satellite imagery, geospatial platforms,
        visual analytics, and computational and statistical models to power effective early
        warning for rapid response to complex humanitarian emergencies.
        (Crisismappers.net, 2011)


Crisis mapping is a global phenomenon for which inclusion is based on network access

rather than geographic location (Bauday, 2010). Participation is open and voluntary.

Crisis mappers utilize a crowdsourced management structure to establish communication

networks (Meier, 2012). This increases clarity in emergency response voluntary. Crisis

mappers utilize a crowdsourced management structure to establish communication


networks (Meier, 2012). This increases clarity in emergency response situations, such as

a natural disaster or government revolution (Heinzelman & Waters, 2010; Zook, Graham,

Shelton, & Gorman, 2010).

        Crisis mappers reflect a cultural movement termed Web 2.0, in which information

flows are interactive, as opposed to one-directional (O’Reilly, 2005). While Web 2.0


originally referred to the change in the social nature of websites on the Internet, it has

recently been used more broadly as the social interaction online has impacted societal

structures offline as well. According to Rogers (2011), crisis mappers are part of a

growing cultural evolution of structuring the management of organizations that are


borderless, collaborative, and pervasively networked. The earthquake recovery in Haiti

was the first time in history when a large-scale, traditionally-managed public health

response directly encountered a crowdsourced relief effort with no management ties to


the traditional responders.

        Within four hours of the earthquake, Patrick Meier, a founder of the organization,

Ushahidi, began implementing an online interface that would eventually include


approximately 2,000 volunteers worldwide (Meier, 2012). This is the primary crisis map

tool examined for this study. This crisis map received messages sent by SMS/text

messages on mobile phones and made them part of an actionable, mapped database that

could be used for communication and situational awareness (Figure 5). For this effort,


crisis mappers spent most of their time translating messages into English and Haitian

Creole. They also coded them by the type of communication such as “emergency medical

issue” or “need for food and water.” Geocoding the message with latitude and longitude


coordinates for inclusion in the interactive, online crisis map was also a major task of the

volunteers (Ushahidi, 2010).

                       produced from the Haiti earthquake crisis map

(Each row is comprised of one message and the different data fields are stored in columns
that include the date/time of the message, location, title, and finally the category labels
applied by the crisis mapping volunteers.)




The majority of the messages sent within the first 48 hours after the earthquake reported

trapped individuals and requested help searching for lost loved ones. Two days after the

earthquake, crisis mappers created a free shortcode mobile phone number, known as


Mission 4636, which Haitians could use to send SMS messages (Mission 4636, 2010).

The Knight Rider Foundation and local telecommunications companies helped

implement this process. Haitian telecommunication officials offered Patrick Meier and


the leadership of Ushahidi an opportunity to send every mobile phone subscriber in Haiti

a text message about the crisis map and encourage their use of the system. Fearing their

inability to code and respond to such a massive number of people—at that time, there


                                                    	  
                                                                                             80


were over two million mobile phone accounts in the system—Ushahidi’s leadership

rejected this offer (Meier, 2013). Nonetheless, the use of the crisis map by Haitians


quickly expanded even without this outgoing text message. Requests for food and water

dominated the map.


Social Network Theory and Social Capital

        Social network theory is a widely applied tool for analyzing individual and group


behavior (Borgatti, Mehra, Brass, & Labianca, 2009). It is important for the disaster

response community to find frameworks within which emerging technologies can be

understood in relationship to the canon of knowledge already gained. Social network


theory and its applications of social capital to describe behavior offer an opportunity to

conceptualize help-seeking and help-offering behaviors. In the changing reference points

of traditional versus emerging communication methods in natural disaster response,


social network theory is valuable.

        Within social network theory, the relationship between two people is referred to

as an edge and the two people connected are together referred to as a dyad. Relationships

between dyads are either analyzed among pairs of people or between people and their


collective network in the sample population (Lincoln, 1984). In both cases, measuring

social capital conferred between dyads is an informative means of characterizing the

connections. Types of dyadic relationships can be evaluated through measures of


structural social capital with features such as interpersonal trust, social support and the

degree of homophily versus heterophily, or likeness versus difference, between a pair of

individuals or an individual and a group (Lin, 1999). This is referred to in the literature as


bonding (homophilous relationships) or bridging (heterophilous relationships) (Harpham,


                                                    	  
                                                                                             81


Grant, & Thomas, 2002). People with lower levels of education, lower incomes, and

increased age tend to have social networks dominated by bonded relationships (Lin,


2002). People who regularly engage with institutions such as a school or their workplace,

where they are exposed to people from different backgrounds from their own tend to have

social networks dominated by bridging relationships.

        Focusing on health outcomes, social networks have patterns of influence on


individuals’ health based on the network size and the tie type that dominates their social

network. Connections between individuals are also explained as strong or weak, which

indicates the cohesive power of the relationship (Granovetter, 1973). Strong ties are most


typically found in homophilic (bonded) relationships and weak ties are most common in

heterophilic (bridging) relationships (Lin, 2002, p. 39). Strong networks of homophilic

individuals are ideal for preserving resources and culture. For instance, Lin (2002) noted


that elite or privileged groups often carry out communication in such a manner. However,

this type of network does not allow an inflow of new ideas and innovations (Rogers,

2003, p. 19).

        While heterophilic, weaker, and larger networks allow for improved diffusion of


ideas, more current research indicates that the ideal network possesses features of both

extremes. In an online simulated model of diffusion, Centola (2010) demonstrated that a

“clustered-lattice” network out-performed a strictly heterophilous network of greater size.


This finding supports Rogers’ (2003) method for diffusion, which, in turn, addresses the

need to “bridge the heterophily gap” (p. 28) by incorporating change agents that are

heterophilous to those they seek to impact. In health promotion activities, this often


happens when peer leaders become involved in health interventions.



                                                    	  
                                                                                             82


        Generally, bonding is associated with negative health outcomes while bridging is

associated with more positive ones (Berkman & Kawachi, 2000). The structural causes of


these relationship patterns lie in: 1) the store of resources a network can offer without

becoming depleted, and 2) the exposure of individuals in the network to innovations,

group membership, and the flow of new information. The social isolation that marks

bonded networks results in less available information when a crisis, such as a natural


disaster, occurs. During a disaster, when information is critical to survival and recovery,

the usage of crisis maps offers a sudden ability to share and receive details. Examples

include locations of food, water, supplies, and aid. This was the single most common


reason individuals accessed the crisis map in Haiti (Feighery, Chandler, & Allegrante,

2013).


Social Capital and Help-Seeking Behavior Following Natural Disasters


        In a discussion of ideal types of social networks, Lin (2001) indicated that dense,

closed networks are ideal for “preserving or maintaining resources.” Children’s safety in

a cohesive community is an example of the benefits of a tightly tied homophilic network.

However, a less dense and open network is conducive for settings such as “searching for


and obtaining resources” (Lin, 2001). Following a disaster, information is the most

important resource heeded by responders, especially for determining whose skills are

needed and what equipment is in demand. Given these issues, a loose and open social


network is theoretically best for disaster response. Crowdsourcing has emerged as a

viable alternative to the traditional bureaucratic response that is typically laden with

hierarchical assessment and communication mechanisms.





                                                    	  
                                                                                             83


        In a sense, disaster response is and always has been crowdsourced. In a study of

earthquake relief, Hilhorst (2004) found that at least 90% of the assistance people


received came from informal sources rather than organizational or governmental means

of support. This is likely due to two factors: first, the inability of official organizations to

reach individuals in a setting with a destroyed infrastructure; and, second, the likelihood

of social behavior phenomena of the most vulnerable disaster victims who interpret


formal means of support as taboo. Crowdsourced natural disaster response may be a more

advantageous approach to overcoming this taboo (Turoff, 2009).

        Applying a theory first identified as amoral familism by Banfield (1958), Gans


(1965) demonstrated the cultural taboo against formal means of support when he

conducted an ethnographic study of a Boston slum inhabited by Italian immigrants. Gans

found that group behavior was self-regulated against any new innovations. This


regulation was accomplished by using subtle and overt tactics such as ridicule and

exclusion of outsiders. Even when new innovations were clearly in their best interest,

such as organizing to prevent the razing of the neighborhood, group behavior shunned

change. Bonded groups tended to prohibit bridging behaviors for fear of losing the


cohesion and exclusiveness that marked the group.

        The health outcomes of this tendency are visible in disaster response. This was

described in research following Hurricane Andrew conducted by Hurlburt, Beggs, and


Haines (2001) and Jenkins (1997). The authors followed individuals’ help-seeking

behavior in response to the hurricane’s devastation. They discovered that people in

tightly-tied, bonded groups marked by high a degree of homophily were least likely to


seek or accept formal means of support, such as food stamps. Instead, they turned to each



                                                    	  
                                                                                           84


other for support until the informal support network was entirely drained of resources.

This finding was strongly supported in a study of Hurricane Floyd’s aftermath, which


found that Medicaid applications did not increase despite the widespread financial shock

to already-vulnerable households (Domino, 2003). Similarly, in a social capital study of

impoverished New Orleans communities after Hurricane Katrina, bonding behavior

quickly bankrupted groups’ resources, resulting in an increase in their vulnerability


(Hawkins, 2010).


Social Capital and Organizational Communication in Disaster Response

        Communication networks within and between organizations in disaster response


has previously been analyzed in terms of social capital. Kapucu (2006) investigated

patters of inter-organization communication network performance following the 2001

World Trade Center attack in New York City. The author invoked the social capital role


of boundary spanners (Williams, 2002), also called change agents (Rogers, 1953), which

are individuals or entities that communicate between two closed networks, sharing the

ideas or innovations from one to the other. Following a disaster, when communication

between information networks is critical, boundary spanners become key decision


makers. Their importance is so foundational to organizations that Kapucu (2006)

recommended creating organizational structures with boundary spanners in place as a

means of building resilience and capacity in advance of a disaster.


        This study investigated ways in which the availability of a crisis map changed

traditional patterns of help-providing and help-seeking behavior after the Haiti

earthquake, through an analysis of the bonding and bridging communication approaches


that transpired. Providing the free access code 4636 was a defining moment that resulted


                                                   	  
                                                                                           85


in thousands of Haitian earthquake survivors seeking help from and sharing information

with formal support providers. Unfortunately, with no previous engagement in a


participatory mechanism to inform their response, most NGOs did not use the online

Ushahidi system to communicate with survivors. Adequate usage of this new technology

was simply too much of a formidable challenge in the first few months. Instead, NGOs

used it to communicate with each other about their internal movements and needs.


Individual use of the shortcode to request help was limited by the crisis mappers’ ability

to code and respond to messages. An automated coding system would have allowed them

to take advantage of two-way communication, namely, sending an introductory text


message about the existence of the crisis map to the entire Haitian mobile phone

population.


                                          Methods



        A database of 3,587 translated SMS messages was coded to categorize the

location of the sender, the identity of the sender, the topic of the message, and its

intended recipient (Table 3). The Type of Sender and the Intended Recipient categories

were designed to provide some insight into the type of social dyad that the message


would represent, assuming it was received by the Intended Recipient. For example, an

earthquake victim reaching out to another victim would be more likely to represent a

homophylic, or bonded, tie, whereas the same victim attempting to communicate with a


relief organization constitutes a heterophylic, or linking, tie.

        Unlike the original message categorization scheme used by the crisis mapping

volunteers, in the present analysis all messages were assigned a single code that best


represented the main intent of the message. Less than 0.1% of messages within each of

                                                   	  
                                                                                                       86


the four categories found in Table 3 were not able to be assigned a code using this


approach. The coded results were exported to the R statistical software package (version


2.14) where the categories were transformed into a daily time series. In addition, the


results were summarized by the various combinations possible between sender and


Intended Recipient.

                                                Results



         The majority of the coded messages (Table 4) were found to have originated

within Haiti (97%), primarily from earthquake victims (82%), and were intended for


relief organizations (97%). When analyzed by message topic, 70% related to the need for


supplies while only 6% reported on availability of supplies. Messages that concerned

missing persons and individuals needing medical assistance were much less frequent


(7% and 6%, respectively).


        When messages were categorized by the possible dyads between Type of Sender


and Intended Recipient of Message, 94% of messages belonged to the six dyads that


occurred between the types characterized by outsiders, earthquake victims, and relief


organizations. Most messages from earthquake victims were intended for relief

organizations (Figure 6), whereas most messages from relief organizations were intended


for other relief organizations.

         When categorized by message topic, “need for supplies” was by far the largest


category within this dyad or any other, accounting for 2,378 of all messages, with the


majority being requests for food and water (Table 5). The dyad with the next highest


number of messages was relief organization/relief organization. However, this grouping


contained a total of only 410 messages, with topics mainly reflecting the need for

supplies, reports of infrastructure damage, and reports of available supplies. Individuals


outside of Haiti mainly communicated with relief organizations. Most of these messages


concerned missing persons and reports of individuals in need of medical assistance.


Communications between earthquake victims and other victims or individuals outside of


Haiti were rare, as were messages from relief organizations to earthquake victims.

                                      Discussion



       The creation and growth of the crisis map after the Haiti earthquake is a historic


moment of change in both the way people respond to disasters and the way disaster

survivors seek help and information in their recovery. Project 4636, its funders, and the


Ushahidi team that implemented the system intended it to be a one-way communication

                                               	  
                                                                                             91


medium (Nelson et al., 2011). However, the adaptation by both the Haitian public and

disaster responders was different. Ushahidi documented at least one case of SMS and real


world interaction. In this case, a coding volunteer saw a message regarding a medical

emergency, found a volunteer to geocode the message, and contacted on-the-ground

emergency workers who assisted in the delivery of a child (Project 4636, 2011). This is

illustrated in Figure 8.














    Figure 8. Example of an interaction between a crisis mapping volunteer coding an
     emergency message received via Project4636 (Dalila) and another volunteer who
                           provided the geographic location (Apo)

(In this case, the coordinates were accurate and emergency responders were able to assist
in the child delivery.)



        The anecdotal accounts of emergency workers responding to the crisis mapping


data serve to illustrate the potential benefits to be gained by improving the capacity of

SMS relay/crisis maps to act as two-way communication platforms. In a summative

report on the role of media and crowdsourced responders in the earthquake response,


Nelson et al. (2011) suggested that more integration of media, especially radio, is an easy

and effective way to respond to survivors. Advances in technology also offer potential for

automated response mechanisms. Machine coding, specifically, would allow a faster





                                                    	  
                                                                                             92


generation of messages and separate them between those requiring a response and those

simply sharing details for improved situational awareness.


        The results of this study showed the extent to which response entities

communicated with each other through the crisis map. The low level of organization-to-

organization communication (10%) immediately following the disaster (Figure 9)

illustrates the strong need for coordination and information sharing among responders,


which is an important role for this technology. However, it also indicated that

opportunities were missed to interact directly with the public and receive more specific,

actionable information on needs. Conversely, the Haitian public used the network both


to send communications and receive information. The frequency of messages sent

(Figure 9) suggest that the sharp increase in the use of the crisis map by earthquake

victims may have continued to rise if there had been a feedback mechanism such as SMS


replies. Failing that, use of the SMS communication system plummeted—marking a

failed innovation launch and diffusion.

        In terms of Kapuku’s (2006) findings that boundary spanners are critical for

organizations after a disaster, the organizations in Haiti missed the opportunity to use the


crisis map as a boundary spanning tool or mechanism to share information between their

closed network and the communities impacted by the earthquake. It was evident in the

messages that many victims clearly sought help from the crisis map. Earthquake


survivors who engaged in the crisis map by sending SMS messages intended their

messages to be addressed as soon as possible. Their messages tended to be very specific.

They were either crying out for help or sharing critical details that would help


responders’ efforts to provide emergency goods and services.



                                                    	  
                                                                                           93


        Using the Ushahidi crisis map for information and help seeking runs counter to

the expected trends of individuals from highly bonded, homophilous communities who


generally shun opportunities to access formal means of support. It is thus possible that the

mobile phone itself has helped move the response from bonding to bridging. We posit

two ways mobile phone-based communications engendered more engagement. First,

individuals sending SMS messages saw themselves as help providers or members of the


larger response to the earthquake relief effort because they were contributing to the

community’s situational awareness. Second, an individual’s mobile phone is itself a

bridging agent, making communications via the phone a larger in-group phenomenon.


        This first explanation is supported by research that demonstrated very different

ways people communicate over a technological medium. Research conducted by Kolko,

Rose, and Johnson (2007) focused on the role of mobile phones and Internet


communication in developing regions of Central Asia. They found that information

seeking and communication are conceptually conflated for technology users. Especially

in areas where people have minimal trust in government and official institutions,

widespread use of text messages and social media for information gathering increases


trust and reinforces social communication networks.

        Rogers (2002) noted that closed, homophilous groups tend to reject new members

and new ideas out of a need to protect existing norms and reinforce social identity.


However, Rogers also explained that, in many instances, change agents can be deployed

to overcome this and “bridge the heterophily gap” (p. 28). Kapuku (2006) also explained

change agents as boundary spanners that can share information more safely between


networks. Especially helpful, change agents such as health workers can be designed to



                                                   	  
                                                                                                            94




share both the traits of the target group and those of the new innovation. This results in a


better chance for the acceptance and diffusion of outside ideas or individuals. In this



context, these findings suggest that mobile phones may be conceptually functional as


boundary spanners/change agents and that future disasters, such as earthquakes in


developing countries, may further benefit health care workers who quickly embrace



mobile phone technologies to communicate with both the impacted community and


outside organizations.

        Hossain (2012) examined incentives for public participation in crowdsourced

endeavors; finding financial reward is seldom a reason or option for participation. Here,


too, social network theory can provide insight. Within bonded networks, another common

trait is social responsibility within the community. This counters individualism with an

obligation to assist others who have been negatively impacted (Bobo, 1991). While it is

taboo to ask for help in such a network, it is equally taboo to not offer it when needed.


This is an important finding because crisis mapping’s participatory nature makes

individuals impacted by disaster an integral part of the system that provides assistance.

As a result, the impetus for eschewing formal networks of assistance is counteracted by


the responsibility to become part of those networks. Since the Haitian earthquake, Twitter

has emerged as an additional social platform for emergency responders to engage with

the public for real-time situational response (Bruns, Lyang, & Luxiang, 2012; Palen,


Vieweg, & Hughes, 2010). Social communication platforms such as SMS and Twitter

unite the resources of formal responders and the general public. Ersting and Kost (2012)

pointed out that hyperlocal knowledge about the specific needs of the community makes

public-based situational awareness a critical resource for first responders.


        Mobile phones were already past the critical mass for social acceptance in a

diffusion curve among the Haitian population. They effectively became change agents by

allowing highly bonded individuals to engage with them without triggering the otherwise


expected taboo response to help-seeking communications in linking directions with

officials. More recent natural disasters such as the Japanese Tsunami and Hurricane

Sandy along the New York/New Jersey coast illustrate that social media platforms


beyond crisis maps are quickly diffusing into natural disaster recovery efforts. Continued

research is needed regarding liability and “dark” pockets of communities without mobile

phones or access to social networks.

                          DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS



        The purpose of this study was to create a rich case study of the introduction of a


new social technology, crisis mapping, to formal disaster response. Overall, the

interviews conducted and data collected showed that the social phenomenon of Web 2.0

has midwifed a revolution in formal disaster response. The Haiti earthquake was a


watershed event for the crisis mapping movement and the current understanding of help-

seeking behavior following a natural disaster.

        This case study is limited in its transferability because few natural disasters match


such a level of destruction and impact. The Haiti earthquake’s vast international response

was still inadequate for meeting the extreme resource and communication needs of

disaster response. Recalling Quarantelli’s (2005) discussion on magnitudes of social

problems, the 2010 earthquake in Haiti easily surpassed the delineation between disaster


and catastrophe—largely because Haiti was already struggling with a daily incidence of

emergencies.

        Two events were catalysts for change in this case study: the introduction of the


shortcode 4636, and the conference in Boston in fall 2010 in which the two closed

networks of crisis mappers and UN managers could meet and interact. The former was a

catalyst because it removed a barrier—cost—of communication for the Haitian public.


The extreme spike in SMS messages after 4636 was introduced demonstrates the



                                                  	  
                                                                                           101


willingness for participation among the earthquake victims. The subsequent fall in

frequency of SMS messages indicated that the public did not perceive enough of a value


in participating to continue use.

        Separately, the conference in Boston allowed the two closed networks to begin

sharing ideas, information, and trust through the creation of change agents, or boundary

spanners. Following this event, the literature generated by UN agencies regarding crisis


mappers changed from a notable tone of annoyance to one of intrigue and acceptance. By

the following year, most UN agencies formed in-house crisis mapping teams.

        Despite its historical value, the crisis mapping response was not particularly


effective at quantifiably saving lives in Haiti. Of the estimated 300,000 people who were

buried in earthquake rubble, only 211 were rescued alive (Heinzelman & Waters, 2010).

Although Ushahidi’s Patrick Meier and other crisis map leadership were given the


opportunity to send a blanket message to every mobile phone subscriber in Haiti, they

turned this down out of fear their force of volunteer coders was not big enough to process

an extremely high volume of incoming messages.

        This study established that machine coding could help solve this limitation by


providing an automated coding system based on keyword searches. Machine coding

offers the benefit of standardized bias, rapid response, and unlimited load capacity. New

applications of machine coding, such as the Boston team’s findings regarding cholera


detection, are among the most promising advances in the field of natural disaster

response.

        The annotated bibliography that comprises Chapter II discussed a wide array of


new technological tools and platforms that are now available for health promotion efforts.



                                                    	  
                                                                                           102


These new approaches are emerging at a rate that often exceeds the pace of the academic

review cycle. In such an environment of rapid change, new approaches to knowledge-


sharing, such as annotated bibliographies, will continue to make a contribution by

combining the benefits of peer review with more frequent updates as compared to

traditional review articles.

        In Chapter III, interviews with responders and crisis mappers were combined with


a quantitative analysis of the messages themselves to obtain insight into the diffusion of

this technology into organizations responsible for disaster response. Initially, aid workers

were not able to close the feedback loop and respond to messages because of general


discomfort with the public nature of social media platforms and concerns about using

resources in response to invalid or intentionally false information. As a result of

experiences in the immediate aftermath of the Haitian earthquake, communication began


between the crisis mapping community and UN agencies, prompting many to engage in

social media, with plans for more formal means of communicating directly with the

public. An analysis of the 3,587 messages that were analyzed found that emergency

response and missing persons reports dominated immediately after the earthquake.


However, water and food shortages were the most common concerns reported over time.

It was demonstrated that a simple machine-coding algorithm applied to the messages was

able to closely track the volunteer-coded labels and, in some cases, identified many more


messages than volunteers had determined within certain categories. The authors noted

that this form of analysis has great potential in better determining urgent needs during

large-scale disasters.






                                                    	  
                                                                                           103


        Finally, in Chapter IV, the messages were coded according to definitions of dyads

between senders and intended recipients, and subsequently examined within the


framework of social capital theory. Whereas studies of previous disaster response efforts

found that the communities most in need were composed mainly of tightly bonded

individuals who resisted formal means of support, the crisis mapping messages were

mostly intended for relief organizations rather than friends or relatives. Messages


between organizations were roughly as frequent as messages from residents to

organizations until the 4636 shortcode was established, after which time messages from

residents to organizations greatly increased, providing some indication that the shortcode


increased help-seeking behavior. While it was previously thought that bonded

communities could not be reached by formal means of support, these findings indicated

that technological innovations may overcome longstanding social customs that reject


outside help.

        The initial challenges people experienced in Haiti integrating crisis mapping into

formal disaster response have largely been overcome in the three years that have passed

since the earthquake. Today, large bureaucratic entities not only embrace such social


platforms, but seek to employ experts in-house and actively fund the further development

of Web 2.0 approaches for humanitarian response. Further advances in implementing

machine coding and two-way SMS exchanges are needed to enhance crisis mapping’s


effectiveness.


                         Emerging Concerns Regarding Liability


        Over time, the involvement at government levels in integrating innovative online


technologies shifts because of concerns of liability. As social media expands its presence

                                                   	  
                                                                                           104


in nearly every aspect of life, it offers both benefits and risks to disaster responders. As

discussed in Chapter IV, mobile phones can be conceptualized as a close friend or bond,


making people less reticent to use them to seek help from otherwise bridging or socially

distant institutions. However, the legal precedent of phones being used to reach

emergency responders means that messages on government social media platforms may

also result in the government incurring liability beyond a practical extent. Currently, if a


person dials 911 in the United States and their call is not responded to, they have a legal

claim for restitution. U.S. 911 centers are working to add text messaging capacities to

their communication networks (Marks, 2011). A foreseeable next step is the addition of


social media platforms such as crisis maps, Facebook, and Twitter.

        According to Anderson, Blumensaadt, Grunwald, Palen, and Sicker (2011),

liability comes in two forms: action and inaction. Liability from inaction would involve


ignoring a warning because of improper use of technology, failure to respond and/or

inadequate response. This liability could be addressed by creating back-up processing

systems, regulation that addresses these instances, and organizational protocols. Liability

from action would involve the dissemination of false or misleading information and/or


violations of privacy. Dissemination of false or misleading information is best addressed

through an intricate filtering system such as indicators as remote locations or differing

routing information, as well as establishing clear guidelines and protocols on how


information is received.

        In 2011, Craig Fugate, Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency

(FEMA), testified on the subject of social media and emergency management before the


Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Subcommittee on



                                                    	  
                                                                                           105


Disaster Recovery and Intergovernmental Affairs (Fugate, 2011). Specifically addressing

the question of risks the government may incur with increased interaction on social media


platforms, Fugate (2011) said, “the notion of treating the public as a resource rather than

a liability is at the heart of our emergency management framework.” However, Edward

Robson, a Philadelphia-based attorney, has led the national conversation questioning this

policy, stating that at the very least, state and federal social media platforms should post


statements warning the public they are not actively monitoring messages and cannot

respond to all concerns (Nextgov, 2011).

        Where government liability concerns may limit full engagement with the public,


private individuals may be best suited to take up this cause. Meier (2011) noted that the

majority of crisis maps and disaster-related social media sites are launched by individuals

rather than government, and cannot be subjected to the same standards. Therefore, while


appropriate guidelines for crisis mapping need to be put in place, it will not be possible

for them to be enforced or to ensure that every mapper abides by them (Meier, 2011).

        The closest U.S. federal courts have come to approaching this question of liability

comes from the case of Lauren Rosenberg vs. Google. Rosenberg sued Google when she


was injured using a Google Maps route (Wassom, 2011). The court found Google was

not liable because it did not owe any “special duty” to Rosenberg and applied its finding

to a broad range of digital media. The court also noted that the user will always be


considered in the best position to apply Internet-provided data to real-world conditions.


        Recent Events Integrating Social Media for Natural Disaster Response


        The most recent major natural disaster response that exemplified this more


complete integration of technological innovation was Hurricane Sandy, which struck the

                                                    	  
                                                                                        106


New York and New Jersey coast in October, 2012. Building on the successful

introduction of online technologies to disaster response in Haiti, New York and New


Jersey officials actively engaged participatory tools from the moment the storm was

forecast to impact the area, through the storm’s arrival, and throughout the aftermath.

Nearly three years after the Haiti earthquake and located in a significantly wealthier

region of the planet, Hurricane Sandy’s participatory response benefitted from advances


in communication technologies such as the popularity of Facebook and Twitter.

Widespread use of GPS-enabled Smartphones in the area was also a key factor, as the

dumbphones prominent in Haiti do not geocode messages. Internet communication


technology was prominent in both official and volunteer responses to this disaster,

including:

        •  The White House made a request to the global open source hacker group,


           TechChange, to develop apps that would help track evacuated seniors and

           map gas station closures (Hackpad, 2012).

        •  A man with no professional background in software development created a


           crisis map that became the city of Hoboken’s official communication system

           post-Sandy (HobokenMap, 2013).

        •  The Office of the Mayor of New York City actively queried Google Analytics


           for search terms that led the public to city pages during the disaster aftermath

           and used top search terms to guide the Mayor’s remarks in televised press

           conferences (Haot, 2013).


        •  The Twitter search string, or hashtag, “#OccupySandy” became a definitive

           community marker for the various streams of activity on Twitter that were



                                                  	  
                                                                                         107


            otherwise difficult to unify—and the success of the hashtag turned into a

            coherent community of informal disaster responders who are still active in


            impacted communities today (OccupySandy, 2013).

        •   The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) launched a

            Smartphone app to help disaster victims stay informed of important


            information.

        •   The Office of the Mayor of New York City estimated that their engagement of

            the public via social media platforms increased their reach tenfold (Haot,


            2013).

        In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, Google hosted a conference in its New York

City offices aimed at exploring what worked best and what failures could be learned from

the technological and social responses to disaster relief. There, as in Haiti in 2010,


discussion focused most on the need to increase access to the maps and apps. Crisis maps

continue to be designed primarily for a computer interface; however, Smartphones are

quickly becoming the preferred way for many people to access the social web.



                       Implications for Professional Preparation


        Healthy People 2020 detailed the importance of online and mobile tools for

“enabling quick and informed action to health risks and public health emergencies” (U.S.


Department of Health and Human Services, 2011a). This study indicated that emerging

health promotion and health education professionals require fluencies in technological

communication platforms. This can be achieved with university-level curriculum focused

on mobile phone app creation, SMS platform trainings, and courses in quantitative


research and analysis packages including R and other open source software.

                                                  	  
                                                                                          108


        Mobile phones are the most important platform for communication in the

aftermath of a natural disaster, especially because they are easier to charge and tend to


remain in close proximity to victims during urgent evacuations. New developments in

this field can focus on better operating systems for low-bandwidth, more intuitive user

interfaces for individuals who are new to mobile apps. Structural support needs for

mobile phone users in disasters, such as charging stations and redundant cell phone


towers, can also enhance communication.


                         Future Recommendations for Research


        Natural language processing is a rapidly emerging field that offers the most


promise for improving the functionality of SMS- and other social media-based

communication platforms. Future research should focus on creating natural language

processing protocols that make two-way communication possible. For example, Figure 8


in Chapter IV demonstrated an SMS communication that colloquially referred to a

geographic location where a woman was in labor. A separate coder was contacted to

geocode the location in latitude and longitude. Natural language processing could engage

an automated communication protocol that would respond to the initial sender with a


message that says, “It appears you are at x location, is that correct?” If, after several

rounds of this interface, an exact location could not be pinpointed, a human geocode

volunteer could be engaged. However, the overwhelming majority of cases could be


geocoded in this fashion, reducing the number of humans needed to map SMS messages.








                                                   	  
                                                                                           109


                                         Conclusion


        In this study, a qualitative analysis of the diffusion of a new technological


paradigm—crisis mapping—into a traditional bureaucratic discipline of disaster response

found that after initial resistance, direct collaboration between communities and

participation by employees and volunteers in social media helped remove institutional

barriers. Whereas the Haiti earthquake crisis mapping response required significant


volunteer labor, computer search algorithms were equally effective at categorizing

messages and, in some cases, outperformed the human coding effort. Finally, by

analyzing the types of social networks created by the crisis mapping effort, it was shown


that mobile phone-based disaster response efforts have the potential to overcome the

resistance to formal means of support by providing an opportunity to create bridging

relationships within closely bonded communities.


        Health education professionals are increasingly involved in natural disaster

preparedness and response. They are critical for building resiliency in communities in

advance of disasters by increasing the capacity of the 90% lay response. New advances in

technology-based communications make new strategies possible, but this depends on


innovation and acceptance of new and emerging technologies.

        The story of crisis mappers in Haiti in 2010 is something of a fable for large

bureaucratic institutions that exist to assist the vulnerable public in extreme times. Four


years before the Haiti earthquake, speaking to a community of TED innovators, Hans

Rosling (2006) famously said, “The world is getting flatter faster in technology than in

health and wealth so we should all be using technology to achieve our goals in health and


wealth.” Yet, when a technological innovation emerged that could dramatically enhance


                                                    	  
                                                                                                  110


community engagement after a natural disaster, the majority of bureaucratic entities


shunned it. The good news is that the shunning was brief. Social networks were

combined, change agents were employed, and the innovation was adopted within a year

of its emergence. New game-changing innovations will assuredly again rock bureaucratic


entities. This study demonstrated the critical importance of speeding up their diffusion.

                                          Wordles


        One available technology for rapid visual analysis of large volumes of text data is

a software program called Wordle, which creates a word cloud that acquires a shape,

color, and font scheme to display the embodied emotion and most frequently appearing


words in a document. Wordles are created based on a complex algorithm for visually

displaying a text via typography, context, and emotion (Viegas, Wattenberg, & Feinberg,

2012). While not typically employed as a stand-alone approach to analysis, the use of


word clouds to visualize texts has been found to be a valuable aid in analysis when used

in tandem with other analysis mechanisms (Weiwei et al., 2010).

        Wordles automatically generated by the body of SMS messages sent after the


earthquake are compared with the UN’s PDNA rapid assessment, conducted during the

same time period, in Figures A-1 and A-2. This visual algorithm generated clear

differences in mood and communicated very different priorities in the assessment of a


situation. While the PDNA prioritized physical reconstruction of dwellings, had the

assessment been guided by the participatory crisis map, it might have prioritized food and

water security over housing and infrastructure reconstruction. In retrospect, water


insecurity encouraged the use of open water sources, which led to the world’s most

deadly current cholera epidemic (Piarroux et al., 2011).
