                           glucose feeding led to the contigC-enrichment of C-4, C-5, and C-6 (Supporting
                           Informtion, Table S2) as anticipated for the catabolic/anabolic transformation of glucose to
                           tyrosine (Scheme 2 and Supporting Informtion, Figure S4). These data provided evidence

                           for the direct incorporation of tyrosine into (P/M)-1, which was then biotransformed by the
N                          fungus to remove the phenol moiety. The proposed pathway for the formation of (P/M)-1
H                          provides a compelling rationale for how other N-hydroxy-pyridone-containing natural
-
A                          products may be generated through a parallel biosynthetic process. In light of the unique
A                          mixed biosynthetic origins of (P/M)- 1, we have given this metabolite the colloquial name
u                          maximiscin, based loosely on a combination of the Latin words maximopere (meaning very
h
r                          or exceedingly) and miscellus (meaning blended).
M
a                          The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activities of (P/M)-1 were tested in the NCI-60 in vitro
u                          cell panel. Compound (P/M)-1 exhibited antiproliferative activity against several cell lines,
s
i                          with an average 50value of 0.39 μM (Supporting Information, Table S6). Closer
t                          examination of these data revealed that the UACC-62 melanoma cell line was not only
                           sensitive to (P/M)-1 50= 0.93 μM), but it also exhibited a monophasic dose-response

                           curve (Supporting Informtion, Figure S29A) that was dissimilar to the biphasic dose-

                         response curves exhibited by most of the other cell lines. For example, the dose-response

N                        curves for (P/M)-1 against both the MDA-MB-453 and HeLa cell lines were biphasic
H                        (Supporting Informtion, Figure S29A), indicating the possibility of two separate
-                        mechanisms of action. Although this response pattern was robust and fully reproducible,
A                        further studies will be required to elucidate the specific mechanisms of action of (P/M)-1 in
A
u                        these different cell lines.
h
r                        A common mechanism of drug resistance exhibited by cancer cells is expression of Pgp
M                        (product of the MDR1 gene), which contributes to the efflux of drugs and toxic
n                        substrates.7To determine if (P/M)-1 can overcome Pgp-mediated resistance, the
u
c                        compound was evaluated in a SK-OV-3/MDR-1-6/6 ovarian cancer cell line transduced with
p                        Pgp[18]and compared to the untransformed parent SK-OV-3 cell line. The SK-OV-3/
t                        MDR-1-6/6 cell line demonstrated substantial resistance to the antiproliferative effects of
                         PTX (Figure 3). In contrast, (P/M)-1 exhibited equivalent inhibitory activities against both

                         cell lines, suggesting it is not a substrate for Pgp (Figure 3).

                         Based on the potency and monophasic dose-response pattern of (P/M)-1 against the
                         UACC-62 cells, this cell line was chosen for further studies. A clonogenic assay was
I                        performed to determine the capacity of (P/M)-1 to inhibit colony formation and the
-
A                        persistence of its cellular effects in UACC-62 cells. Cells were treated with (P/M)-1 for 8 h
A                        after which the compound was removed by washing the cells. Treatment at a concentration
u                        of 6 μM resulted in a significant decrease in colony formation (p ≤ 0.01) compared to
h                        vehicle-treated controls (Figure 4). These results indicate that subsequent to drug removal,
r
M                        the biological effects of (P/M)-1 against UACC-62 cells are moderately persistent.
n
u                        With these promising results, we proceeded to investigate whether (P/M)-1 had antitumor
c                        activity in vivo by evaluating its activity in a UACC-62 xenograft mouse model. Athymic
p                        nude mice bearing UACC-62 xenograft tumors were treated by administering (P/M)-1 (5
t
                         mg/kg) daily for 5 d, withholding treatment for 2 d, and providing daily treatment with (P/
                         M)-1 (5 mg/kg) for an additional 5 d. This dosing schedule provided significant inhibition of
                         tumor growth relative to untreated control mice (p = 0.027) (Figure 5) without causing
                         substantial weight loss (Supporting Information, Figure S29). It is noteworthy that the

                         UACC-62 cell line forms an aggressive, rapid-growing tumor in vivo, so the experiment was
I                        discontinued after 14 d due to excessive tumor burden in the control mice.

P                        In summary, a new Tolypocladium sp. isolate was obtained through our crowdsourcing
A                        initiative. This isolate produced the unique polyketide-shikimate-NRPS-hybrid compound
u
h                        (P/M)-1 via chemical epigenetic induction, culture medium variation, and bacterial co-
r                        culture strategies. The results of these studies speak to the multitude of interdependent
M                        factors involved in stimulating fungal secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Compound (P/
a                        M)-1, which possesses an unusual O=C-N-O-C bridge, showed in vitro cytotoxic activity
u
c                        against a number of cell types and in vivo antitumor activity in a UACC-62 xenograft cancer
p                        model. Moreover, (P/M)-1 exhibited an ability to circumvent Pgp-mediated drug resistance,
t                        which makes this a potentially valuable compound for further investigation. These results
                         also highlight the remarkable opportunities that exist for fostering the meaningful
