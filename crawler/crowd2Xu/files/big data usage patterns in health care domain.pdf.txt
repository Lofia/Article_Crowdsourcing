bottom-up approach for model creation by

Regnell et al. [13].The process started with
a rapid literature analysis to select use cases
that captured common usages of big data
in health care potentially relevant to assess
the benefits and risks of vaccines. Publica
tions were identified and key information
was extracted, focusing specifically on use

cases of big data.These use cases were then
evaluated to assess their potentiality to im
prove research methods of assessing vaccine
benefits and risks.


2 SearchStrategy
The literature analysis employed is suited

to the exploratory reviews of emerging
technologies in a given domain. It relies
on the fact that there are common usage
patterns of techniques in the same domain.
Therefore, a sample of actual uses of big
data in the domain of interest is sufficient
for determining the generic usage patterns

(known here as use cases).
   We searched PUBMED, Medline, Scopus,
Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database
for publications related to big data in health
care. We focused on health care databases,    Fig. 1 AdaptedPRISMAflowdiagram
