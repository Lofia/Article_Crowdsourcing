One of the hallmarks of the communication revolution over the past decade has been its support for participation, whether that

be in the active engagement of patients searching theWeb for answers to vital health questions, or in the collective energies of
self-organizing communities through social media. At the same time, some of the major obstacles to achieving a full and equi            -
table reach of evidence-based cancer control knowledge have been traced back to discontinuities in communication either within

clinical care or the broader public awareness system. Communication scientists from the National Cancer Institute, the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, and the American Cancer Society joined forces in 2010 to investigate ways in which com              -

munication science can be used to improve coordination and enhance participation in cancer control for the nation. From 2010 to
2013, the three organizations worked together in 1) convening two meetings designed to assess the status of funded research in
communication science, 2) completing a systematic review of literature published over the previous 10 years, and 3) authoring

a blueprint for coordinated efforts using the implications of communication science.The blueprint consists of three major goals:
first, to identify high-yield targets of opportunity using the health impact pyramid articulated by Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention Director,Thomas Frieden; second, to leverage opportunities within the new communication environment, including

the opportunities catalyzed by national efforts to create an infrastructure for evidence implementation through health information
technology; and third, to assist in coordinating efforts across collaborative entities through participative media.

1                      Effective communication strategies are ready for dissemination through a national action plan.
2                      Human relations and culture are important to establish trust with communities, even online.
3                      Messages have to be high tech and high touch to engage and empower communities as active participants in health care.

4                      Cancer communicators need to know how to adopt social media and mobile strategies while remaining cognizant of the
                         digital divide and basic communication principles.
5                      Infrastructure, privacy and regulation, and hardware compatibility issues need addressed to integrate health data.
6                      Stories can be effective communication strategies but can cause misinformation. We need to identify the appropriate uses
                         of testimonials and explore the costs vs benefits of this strategy.
7                      Health literacy and numeracy are associated with health disparities and require our attention as health care becomes

                         increasingly complex.
8                      Patient–provider communication creates important indirect health outcomes when consistent with clinical evidence and
                         patient values. Communication should be improved through changes in the medical school curriculum and innovative
                         physician assessment methods.
9                      To disseminate research into practice, we need to require business plans and systematic research designs such as rapid

                         learning (eg, practitioners and researchers working together in real-world environments).
10                     Novel, strategic community partners—from families and caregivers to lawmakers, media, and for-profits—have a unique
                         role in dissemination.
11                     Communication researchers and practitioners need more funding, especially for dissemination, social media, Web, and
                         mobile applications.
