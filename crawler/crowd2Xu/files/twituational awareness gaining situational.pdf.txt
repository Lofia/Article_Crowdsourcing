 Public health and other agenci es need situational awareness to respond effectively to disasters or other incidents.

 Traditional means of obtaining this information require significant time and personnel. Social media is becoming
 increasingly popular among American citizens, and research is demonstrating that it may be a useful tool for
 bolstering information about unfolding events. This research analyzed the potential of the microblogging service

 Twitter in providing situational awareness. Tweets from a major snowstorm affecting the sta te of Massachusetts were
 collected, coded for content, and compared to traditional public health methods. The results indicate that Twitter can
 provide a rich source of data for responding agencies. Still, the immense volume of conversations makes exngacti
 useful information in a timely manner a significant challenge. Practical approaches uncovered during this research can

 help agencies with nascent social media surveillance programs begin to unearth the valuable information that Twitter
 contains. Collaboation with information technology experts could allow public health and other responding agencies
 to create even greater value from social media platforms.

                            EXECUTIVE SUMMARY



Public health and other agencies need situational awareness to respond eff     ectively to
disasters or other incidents. This information allows responders to improve their

response, target neglected areas, and learn from mistakes. Traditional means of obtaining

this information, such as rapid needs assessments, require significant t ime and personnel.
The CDC suggests 20 to 30 people are needed for their rapid needs assessment, the

Community Assessment for Public Health Emergency Response (CASPER).

       Social media is becoming increasingly popular among American citizens, and

allows peopl e to provide information about every aspect of their lives. Research is

demonstrating that it may be a useful tool for bolstering information about unfolding
events. This research analyzed the potential of the microblogging service Twitter in

providing situational awareness. Twitter posts are attractive because tweets are visible to

everyone, not just friends of the poster. The 140-   character limit imposed by Twitter
encourages brevity. The number of people using Twitter has more than quadrupled since

2010, so the platform is becoming increasingly popular.

       Tweets from a major snowstorm affecting the state of Massachusetts were

collected, coded for content, and compared to traditional public health methods of

intelligence gathering. Data from three separate hashtags were analyzed to see how
content varied depending on the hashtag used. The results indicate that Twitter can

provide a rich source of data for responding agencies. Users posted information about the

impact of the storm, needed resources, and their own well -being. This information could

be used by responders to improve future responses. Much of the information sought by a
tool such as CASPER was available from tweets studied in this research.

       Still, the immense volume of conversations makes extracting     useful information

in a timely manner a significant challenge. Practical approaches uncovered during this

research can help agencies with nascent social media surveillance programs begin to

unearth the valuable information that Twitter contains. Agencies can initiate social media



                                           xvii
surveillance without any additional resources. Collaboration with information technology

experts could allow public health and other responding agencies to create even greater
value from social media platforms.

       This research could not have been completed without the support of my incredible
family. My beautiful wife, Catherine, has been there to assist me every step of this

journey. Whenever I felt as if I could not go any further, her constant support reminded

me that I could never repay the sacrifices I have asked of her without delivering a
completed thesis. She is the love of my life, and a true inspiration. My daughters, Shayla,

Ashley, and Hailey, have been patient and understanding of all the time I was not around

while completing this project. I hope that I could at least serve as a role model for their
own studies. Our three dogs, Jackson, Elly, and Gribble, offered a warm heart and a cold

nose to help reduce my stress levels.

       My advisors, Bob Josefek and Lauren Fernandez, played an instrumental role in

guiding me through the research process. They constantly provided helpful tips, sage

advice, and useful articles. They additionally waded through constant emails and
revisions, constantly moving the proces s forward. I hope to someday have the honor of

meeting both of them in person, although I find it very appropriate to develop a thesis on

a Web 2.0 application using Internet technology.

       The faculty and staff at the Center for Homeland Defense and Security         have

created a truly special learning environment. It would take too much time and effort to
thank each one individually, so it would be easier to list those who did not offer more

support than I had a right to ask. There is not a single person on that list.

       My mother, Joyce, has been supportive of the process who frequently checked to

see if I needed anything, and patiently listened to all my complaints. My brother, Dave,

was there to remind me how far I have ventured since I began this process.

       I would be remiss not to thank the members of Cohort 1201/1202, not only for

their support, but also for enriching my learning experience by providing their expert
perspectives. I felt honored to be included among a group of such accomplished and

intelligent people.

        It may be a bit unconventional, but I would also like to take this opportunity to

thank the musical artists Lucero, Ben Harper, Cowboy Junkies, Drive By Truckers,
Sublime, Frank Black, and numerous others for recording what became the soundtrack to

my research.

        I would also like to thank the Oregon Health Authority for allowing me to pursue

this incredibly rewarding experience. Jaime Walters deserves special recognition for her

assistance during the time I spent in Monterey.

        Finally, but in no way last, I dedicate this thesis to my father, Ron. I hope I would

have made you proud, and if I am ever half the man you were, I will have accomplished
something extraordinary.

          I.     INTRODUCTION AND LITERATURE REVIEW



A.      PROBLEM SPACE

        In the aftermath of disasters, often disruptions and illnesses occur that threaten the

public health. Considered the basic science of public health, epidemiology is the study of
                                                                1
disease (and absence of it) and all the factors that influence itPublic health responders
use epidemiology to enhance situational awareness during incidents, also known as

disaster epidemiology. Disaster epidemiologists have traditionally used Rapid Needs

Assessments (RNA) to assess the impact of a disaster on the population, determine the

health needs, and evaluate the effectiveness of relief efforts. Ultimately, these efforts are
credited with reducing mortality for current disasters, as compared to those from the past,

by making the population more resilient.

        Given the nature of emergencies, it is important that d  ata be collected quickly.

Some data becomes either impossible to collect later (e.g., quality of onsite care), or is

useless to decision makers (e.g., ill patients die before treatment can be given). The

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) cre           ated a tool for disaster
epidemiologists known as Community Assessment for Public Health Emergency

Response (CASPER). It is designed to be implemented within 72 hours following the

decision to collect data to ensure that the data collected is timely and us eful. Completing

a CASPER is time consuming and requires significant staff support.

        Among the information required by incident managers, vulnerable population data

is critical. As emergencies vary by type, so too do the populations most vulnerable to a
specific disaster. Thus, disaster epidemiology helps identify these populations that require

particular assistance from responders. Community assessments, such as CASPER, can

also help responding agencies identify issues not previously recognized or may be

emerging. Agencies can use these assessments to target populations most in need of
                                                                                        2
assistance, and determine which, if any, community needs have already been met.

        To analyze an affected community, significant human capital is required to

complete a CASPER . The CDC estimates that 20 –30 interviewers are needed.               3 With

public health funding shrinking, even less resources are available for this labor -intensive

activity.4  Given the significant amount of resources a CASPER requires, it is

unsurprising that the Or egon Public Health Division has never actually performed one.

While CASPER is a well-designed tool that provides useful results, it requires too much

time, personnel, and coordination for use during emergencies. A well-designed process is

not useful to res ponders without the resources to put it into action. Public health

responders need a quicker, less labor-intensive method to gain situational awareness.

        Social media offers a compelling opportunity to bolster situational awareness with

information similar to that collected by a CASPER by tapping into conversations

happening on the Internet. Twitter is a microblogging application that allows users to post

status updates or comments of up to 140 characters. An advantage of Twitter over other

types of social media is that messages are mostly public, and can be viewed by anyone.          5

Pew Internet research suggests that the adoption of Twitter is rapidly increasing, with the

number of users who access Twitter daily doubling since 2011, and quadrupling since

2010. The report notes that approximately 15% of adult Internet users are also Twitter

users, and 8% of adult Internet users report using Twitter daily. In June 2012, Twitter

CEO Dick Costolo reported that users are now tweeting 400 million posts per day. A

growing body of literature suggests that Twitter does provide valuable information during
                                                                            , ,
emergencies that could be useful for incident managers and responders.     6 7 8

        A significant barrier to incorporating Twitter into the public health response is the

volume of Tweets. Previous research has investigated automated tools to process and

analyze Tweets, by filtering out irrelevant information, and by allowing researchers to

more easily find the critical information. At the moment, an off –the-shelf solution is not

available. Current methods employed by the Oregon Public Health Division involve staff

manually entering and reviewing Twitter searches. This method is time            -consuming,

challenging, and results in the division only having a general sense of what is being

discussed on Twitter.


B.      RESEARCH QUESTION

        Public health agencies face shrinking budgets, and traditional methods of gaining

situational awareness are resource intensive. Can social media be used to provide

situational awareness to public health and other responders during an emergency? If

social media can provide situational awareness, how can a public health agency leverage

this technology with limited financial and human resources?


C.      LITERATURE REVIEW

        Twitter was launched in July 2006.    9 Other social media webs ites are also new,

and a growing body of research has emerged on how to use social media to improve

disaster response and recovery.     10 11 12 Themes in the literature are evaluations of the

utility of Twitter and social media for providing situational awareness         , case studies in

which social media was successfully used during disasters, social media as an indicator of

disease, literature about how information spreads on social media, and reports of

available tools to enhance social media awareness.

        Note: this th esis makes extensive reference to the use of hashtags, beginning in

the literature review. Hashtags are used in Twitter to organize discussions, and make it

easier to find items of interest. Hashtags are identified using the # symbol. Hashtags are

not controlled by employees at Twitter, but are added by end users as a way to flag their

posts. At the beginning of an event of interest to users of Twitter, competing hashtags

may be used, but users appear to settle on a winner in an organic, evolving manner.         13

                Situational Awareness


        Research shows that information available on Twitter and other social networks

could provide very important clues for emergency managers, including additional sources

information over social media.    16 A study of Twitter data in New Zealand that analyzed

approximately 66 million tweets, found abundant useful information for emergency

managers contained in the social media reports and proposed a method for New Zealand

officials to u se Twitter to detect emerging incidents.   17 Analysis of similar Twitter data

showed a wealth of information about the Japan earthquake and tsunami of 2011.         18 These

studies also explore whether tweets are a reliable source of information. Although the

research was related to influenza detection, Chow found very little misinformation in a

study of over three million tweets. Gao et al. noted that while the crowdsourcing system

Ushahidi (described below) allows users to verify reports made by other parties, more

research needs to be done to determine a better method to prevent false reports.              19

However, Liu et al. identified several methods that researchers should explore to verify

the accuracy of self reporting, including comparison to more traditional data acquisit ion

methods.  20 The Queensland Police Service (QPS) of Australia successfully addressed

misinformation by directly countering it on Twitter, and denoting it with the hashtag

#Mythbusters.  21

        Studies of this nature also explore whether geocoded location data offers

information useful to incident managers for situational awareness. Users can allow

Twitter to attach geocoded data to tweets, which can be invaluable for mapping disaster

impacts. MacEachren et al. found useful data on relief supplies and spontaneous            fund

be accurate. Users could send their reports from a different location than the actual area

being reported on, perhaps waiting until they are in a safer location to send a tweet, which

heavily favors the 25–54 age range.     24 Responders will need to be cognizant that Twitte r

data may not be representative of the entire population during a disaster. However, a

survey conducted by the American Red Cross found that many social media users turn to

those applications in an emergency, and they are likely to follow advice given thr           ough

social media platforms.   25 Thus, by ignoring social media, agencies could miss a chance

to engage with people who primarily get information through those channels.

        Reports from the Haiti earthquake indicate that many of even the most poverty            -

stricken populations were able to provide data on their situations using the Ushahidi text

messaging system.    26  An advantage of this text messaging system is that it does not

require a smart phone or a Twitter account; therefore, it is available to a larger portion of

the population. As of March 2012, Nielson reports that only 50% of United States (U.S.)

cell phone users have smartphones, although this usage is a rapidly increasing trend.        27 In

contrast, evidence exists that social media can actually enhance the ability f          or public

health departments to interact with populations that have traditionally been difficult to

reach, including rural or isolated people, and those suffering from a disease associated

        2.      Studies of Successful Use of Social Media During Emergencies

        A number of incide nts have occurred in which Twitter and other microblogging

technologies were used to enhance situational awareness during an incident. Much of this

literature relates to disaster management activities outside the public health response, but

many, if not the majority of disasters, threaten public health.    30Van Leuven analyzed the

use of social media during the 2007 southern California wildfires, and found that private

groups were able to harness the technology successfully to provide actionable

intelligence f or citizens.  31  The crowdsourcing system called Ushahidi was used

successfully to provide situational awareness during the 2010 Haiti earthquake, and the

2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami.      32 In addition to sorting data from Twitter, Ushahidi

can utilize data from other social media, such as Facebook. An even more compelling

feature very successful in Haiti was accepting data in Ushahidi using text messaging from

cell phones. While the earthquake destroyed the majority of the cell towers in Haiti, many

were qui ckly repaired. The free text messaging hotline allowed self              -reporting on

conditions that allowed responders to direct aid more effectively.     33 An advantage of both

text messaging and Twitter is that the low bandwidth of a short message will often be
delivered on an overloaded or damaged cell network, while a phone call may not.       34


        The Queensland Police Service (QPS) recently established itself as a leader

among public safety agencies in harnessing the effective use of social media; Twitter, in

particular, to e nhance their emergency response efforts. As the lead responding agency

for massive flooding in 2010–2011, QPS used social media effectively to improve their
response. In a matter of days, the media was relying on QPS as a key source of

information, including displaying QPS tweets on their news crawlers, and referring the

public to the QPS social media accounts for the most up-        to-date information. Posts by

QPS to social media were extremely focused on providing advice and situational

awareness to the public, and QPS often responded to individual requests for information.

It provided 24/7 staffing to moderate the QPS social media accounts, and became a

clearinghouse for all flood related information. QPS even went so far as to post

information originating from other departments and agencies. Twitter users responded
warmly to QPS efforts, and retweeted QPS posts at a very high rate. These retweets

significantly amplified the messages being sent by the police service, which enabled them

to reach Twitter users faroutside their sphere of influence.  35


        3.      Social Media as an Indicator of Disease Outbreaks


        A third genre of literature explored how Twitter can be used to track disease
outbreaks, which is also important during emergencies, as diseases, such as cholera, can

spread after a disaster. Traditional epidemiology relies on hospital discharge records, so

data on emerging outbreaks can take two weeks for information to reach public health

officials from sentinel physician networks.   36 An early study by Eysenbach showed that

web searches related to influenza keywords was highly correlated to epidemiological

fact, Google now collects and presents user search data related to influenza, wit            h its

Google Flu Trends product.     38 The Preparedness Surveillance Epidemiology Team of the

Oregon Public Health Division is now evaluating this tool as a secondary indicator of

influenza conditions in the state, although it is not expected to replace traditi            onal

surveillance. 39 Along the same line, analysis of two years of Twitter data showed a very

high correlation between tweets about influenza -like symptoms and traditional influenza

surveillance data. 40 Lampos and Cristianini had similar successful findings, additionally

noting that their system of analyzing tweets could be expanded to all languages, which

supports public health efforts to reach all populations in a jurisdiction.   41 Corley et al. also

demonstrated that blog posts related to influenza were highl            y correlated to current

epidemiological methods.     42 Social media appears to have the potential to revolutionize

public health disease surveillance, particularly due to the potential for rapid detection.

Social media allows individuals to report on their symptoms before they even decide to

seek treatment, but several hurdles must be cleared to truly unlock this technology.         43 In

particular, it is a nearly overwhelming challenge to sift through the approximately 400

million tweets per day to find useful information,    44 which echoes a common roadblock to

implementing a social media plan cited by emergency management professionals that

        4.      How Information Spreads on Social Media

        A number of studies evaluate how information is spread on Twitter. Public health

must provide information to the public during emergencies on how to stay safe and

healthy. Twitter has the potential to assist officials in providing timely and effe        ctive

messages to the public, and research indicates that Twitter users tend to promote official

sources of information over unofficial sources.    46While health departments are starting to

use social media to push messages to the public, they have not yet re        ally harnessed the

technology to enable two-way communications with the public and other stakeholders.            47

One problem with this slow adoption of social media by public health is that in many

cases, rumors or false information can possibly be spread without being countered by
                                                48
accurate information from official sources.         QPS, during its response to flooding in

2010–2011, offers an effective model, both for engaging citizens into a dialogue, and the
                                                        49
effectiveness of directly countering misinformation.


        5.      Available Tools for Gaining Situational Awareness on Social Media

        Some software tools for extracting situational awareness from social media

already exist, but none appears ready for plug        -and-play use by health departments.

Infovigil, which was developed by the Centre for Global eHealth Innovation in Toronto,

is described as an “infoveillance” system that gathers information from the Internet from

bolster routine disease surveillance.

        HealthMap is a mash-up (combination of two or more Internet technologies) that

searches the Internet for public health news and sorts (both automatically and manually)

this information into aggregated data. Users can also submit reports. This system appears

to be an attempt to provide public health news for geographic areas presented in a visual

manner.  51 Biocaster is a very similar application that also presents collected information

on a map.  52

        Flusurvey is a European effort to enable self -reporting of influenza symptoms to

the flusurvey.org website. Users register, and then complete a survey every week. This

information is collected and graphically presented.    53


        Ushahidi is an open source platform that enables crowdsourced mapping using

web, email, text, and Twitter technologies. It is designed to be easily deployable to areas

affected by disaster, and allows impacted communities to provide status updates.

Crowdmap is a version of Ushahidi that is hosted, and does not require a web server.

GeoChat (developed by InSTEDD) is another variant of the idea behind Ushahidi. Both
have been successfully deployed to provide situational awareness in past disasters.      54


        Yahoo Pipes is a product that allows users to create mash -ups. Boulos et al. were

graphically able to monitor for the West Nile Virus (WNV) by using Pipes to

automatically fetch climate data that allowed them to predict areas prone to high WNV

is programmed, users do not have to refresh or update data manually.   55


        6.     Need for Further Research

        The key gap in research lies in the practical application of social media tools. An

overwhelming amount of information is available on social media, but professionals

could benefit from methods and tools to process and organize information efficiently so

that they can make quick and effective decisions. Much of the research presented above
took a large volume of data and analyzed it without the pressures and extreme time

constraints that an active emergency presents.  56 Faster methods of processing data into

useful intelligence are needed to provide information in a timely manner. A method that

will allow a public health employee to uncover information easily based on the current

needs of their agency is a focus of this research.

D.      OVERVIEW OF CHAPTERS


        To evaluate the utility of social media at providing situational awareness for
public health and other responding agencies, this thesis evaluates how people used the

micro-blogging service Twitter in the aftermath of a severe snowstorm in Massachusetts,

and whether that information might be useful for public health and other responding

agencies.

        Chapter II discusses the method used to analyze tweets from the storm.

Chapter III evaluates tweets specific to the Boston, MA metropolitan area after a

significant snowstorm. Chapter IV investigates tweets from the same storm, but from a

statewide perspective. Chapter V looks at tweets in the Cape Cod area from the same
snowstorm. Chapter VI analyzes        the three case studies as a whole, and offers

recommendations for the implementation of a social media surveillance program, and

items that warrant future research. The Appendix explores whether Twitter can be used to

provide psychological first aid following a disaster.

                                  II.     METHOD



       To evaluate if social media contains situational awareness that could be valuable

for responders, this thesis studies the use of Twitter following a severe weather event in

Massachusetts. Tweets were collected from three hashtags (see below) during and after

the storm. Tweets were then coded according to content, and analyzed to determine if
they could be useful in providing situational awareness. This data was then compared to

the question bank in the CDC CASPER Toolkit       57 to explore which facets of disaster

epidemiology might be possible using social media. Finally, a brief word cloud

demonstration is provided as way to visualize quickly some of the key subjects posted to

each hashtag.

       This study th en takes a self -reflective approach to address the second research

question on how a public health agency can use this technology with limited money and

personnel. Observations acquired during the course of this research are used to
recommend techniques and address remaining challenges.


A.     THE EVENT


       On February 8, 2013, a severe winter storm moved over the northeastern United
States and dumped a significant snowfall around the region. According to an article by

The Weather Channel, Boston, MA experienced the f ifth largest snow accumulation in

city history.8 This event provided an excellent opportunity to study how residents of

Massachusetts used Twitter to interact with each other while dealing with the effects of

the storm, and evaluate if those conversations could be valuable for public health and
other responding agencies.

B.     DATA COLLECTION

       TweetCharts.com was used to help identify popular hashtags used during the

aftermath of the blizzard. On February 8, 2013, the following search terms were used at

TweetCharts.com.

       •       Blizzard + northeast

       •       Boston + blizzard

       •       Boston + storm

       •       New England + blizzard

       •       Blizzard

       Popular hashtags included #blizzard2013, #bosnow, #capecodstorm, #ctstorm,

#mastorm, and #nemo. Three were selected for detailed analysis, #bosnow,

#capecodstorm, and #mastorm. The three hashtags chosen focused on events in
Massachusetts, and could offer perspective on how distinct, yet similar, hashtags might

contain varying information.

       MDX Online provided a free application called The Archivist, which allows a

user to archive tweets for later analysis. Tweets can be saved, and exported for analysis

using programs, such as Microsoft Excel, which was used for this study. 59 As of March

5, 2013, The Archivist application used in this study was no longer supported due t   o

changes by Twitter, but a revised version is now available.


C.     CODING METHODOLOGY

       Tweets were exported to Microsoft Excel, analyzed, and the content coded.

Tweets were coded for as many categories as were deemed appropriate; no attempt was
made to code o nly for the “most” applicable category. Rather, all applicable categories

were included. Table 1 explains each coding category. The same categories were used for

all three hashtags analyzed in this study.

                                               when a tweet was posted. Tweets were
                                               organized into one-hour groups. Tweets
                                               were also organized into six- and twelve-
                                               hour groups, but those groupings were not

                                               useful during analysis. The hourly

                                               contained a written clue to the location of
                                               the user or the subject of the tweet.

                                               Location clues ranged from specific
                                               mentions of a place (e.g.,” Copley
                                               Square,” “outside my window”) to less
                                               specific information (e.g., “Cambridge,”
                                               “#somerville”). This study did not attempt
                                               to determine if the tweets were geocoded

                                               due to limitations of data obtained using
                                               The Archivist. Other projects have
                                               mapped tweets using more sophisticated
                                               techniques, such as a project from the
                                               School of Information Studies at Syracuse
                                               University,61 which mapped tweets using

                                               the hashtag #BostonMarathon after the
                                               bombing of the Boston Marathon on April
                                               15, 2013.
Retweet Status                                 Tweets were coded with whether they
                                               were retweets, or were original tweets.

                                               During content analysis, the researchers
                                               determined that many “original” tweets
                                               were actually identical to each other’s,
                                               i.e., they were essentially retweets that did
                                               not cite the original poster. However,
                                               those tweets were coded simply as

                                               original tweets.

Advice                                         This category indicates whether the tweet
                                               provided advice to residents on dealing
                                               with the storm. Advice included ways to
                                               avoid carbon monoxide poisoning, how to

                                               find or obtain services, and advisements to
                                               stay off the roads to allow crews better
                                               access, among other items.
Official Info (General and Specific)           These two categories note whether a tweet
                                               contains official information, whether
                                               general or specific in nature. These codes
                                               primarily related how government

                                               agencies were responding to the storm and
                                               the resulting snow.
Media Info                                     This group tweets all contained
                                               information from various media
                                               organizations related to the storm. Many
                                               of these tweets contained compilations of

                                               pictures and input from individuals, or
                                               general media descriptions of the impact
                                               of the blizzard. Tweets were included if
                                               media organizations were referenced,
                                               whether the post originated from an
                                               official media account or not. Retweets
                                               from individual accounts were also

                                               included if they referenced media
                                               organizations.
Closures                                       These were actually four separate
                                               categories of tweets that indicate whether
                                               a business, government facility/agency,
                                               school, or airport was open or closed

                                               during the storm. The airport category was
                                               initially designed as a catch all for other
                                               types of closures, but none was noted
                                               besides airport closures.

                                              specific in nature. General weather

                                              updates included comments about how
                                              much snow accumulated around town, etc.
                                              The specific comments were typically
                                              related to weather/snow conditions at a
                                              user’s residence or other specific location,
                                              and particularly, during the beginning of
                                              the storm, frequently contained images of

                                              the situation being described.
General Info                                  This category is for users reporting on
                                              information about the aftermath of the
                                              storm that did not fit into other categories.
Road Information                              Tweets containing information about the
                                              status of local roads, including highways,

                                              arteries, and side streets, were placed into
                                              this category.
Transit Information                           Tweets in this group had information
                                              about public transportation. Most of these
                                              related to the MBTA“T,” but information
                                              about busses, Amtrak, and commuter

                                              trains were also included. Transit
                                              information was initially included with
                                              road information, but mass transit
                                              information would have been lost in the
                                              volume of road information.
Flooding                                      Reports of flooding were included in this

                                              comments relating to a personal agenda.

Off Topic/Unknown                             This category included tweets either
                                              completely unrelated to the storm, or the
                                              content was unknown. Unknown content
                                              included foreign language posts, tweets
                                              that had no discernible meaning, and
                                              tweets that contained a link with no
                                              textual indication of the content.

Internet Links                                Tweets that contained a link were
                                              included. Links were not systematically
                                              reviewed as part of this study, although a
                                              few were investigated when they appeared
                                              to be relevant to the research. The links
                                              that were briefly reviewed were primarily

                                              images, but website links were also
                                              included.
Health Impact                                 Tweets in this group contained
                                              information about how the storm impacted
                                              the health of the public, whether general
                                              or specific that included tweets about

                                              children being poisoned by carbon
                                              monoxide, individual reports of people
                                              who were cold due to power outages or
                                              exposure, and patients prevented by
                                              conditions from accessing healthcare.
Health Info                                   This category of tweets contained health
                                              related information, such as information to

                                              prevent carbon monoxide poisoning,
                                              health risks from snow shoveling, and
                                              where to report homeless who may need
                                              sheltering. This category was added while
                                              coding other categories, when the
                                              researcher realized that health related

                                              tweets were not simply reports of how the
                                              storm affected health, but also included
                                              information that could be used to protect
                                              health.

                                               references to the Adopt-A-Hydrant
                                               program. Worcester, MA describes the

                                               program as a way for citizens to help
                                               firefighters quickly locate a fire hydrant.

                                               residence.62This category was added
                                               during coding of other categories, when it

                                               emerged as a theme.

        Once the data was coded, it was studied in a variety of ways. Each category was

examined according to the time when tweets were posted, to see if content changed over
time. Retweet status was evaluated to look for topics that users were more likely to pass

on to their followers. Categories were compared to the total volume of tweets, to see

which types of conversations were more popular. Tweets were also analyzed to see if

certain topics were more likely to contain Internet lin  ks. Tweets providing situational
awareness were examined to see if they also contained clues about location.


D.      ANALYSIS AND CASPER COMPARISON

        The data were then compared to the bank of questions recommended for disaster

epidemiology in the CASPER Toolkit. The question bank is intended to cover a variety

of disaster situations. Therefore, not all questions would be used for a specific CASPER.

Questions are organized into 10 general categories.

        1.     Identification and physical location

        2.     Demographics
        3.     Damage and repair

        4.     General utilities

        5.     Carbon monoxide exposure
        6.     Animal safety

E.      WORD CLOUD


        A word cloud is a visual representation of a given piece of text. Words that appear
more frequently are lar ger, and less frequent words are smaller. The web application

Wordle was used to create the word clouds in this study. Wordle.net describes Wordle as

a toy, and is not intended as a serious scientific analysis tool for this thesis. However,

after coding and analyzing each series of tweets, the decision was made to include them.

The researcher felt that they offer a crude visualization of the actual content of each

dataset, and could potentially be an indicator of topics popular for discussion. Wordle
automatically removes common English words, such as “the,” “and,” etc. Additionally,

the option to convert all letters to lowercase was selected when research revealed that

people used various capitalizations in these datasets. To keep a consistent visual forma t,

options, such as font, color, etc., were standardized for the word clouds in this study.

After that basic formatting, the word cloud is presented and briefly discussed. Then, the

most common words, which appear in the largest font sizes, were removed. T opics that
were less frequently discussed for each hashtag become easier to view, and are then

briefly discussed.

        The hashtag #bosnow is explored in this chapter. First, the event that prompted
the hashtag is des cribed. Then, details about the method specific to this hashtag are

explained. Data are then presented and discussed. Finally, the data are compared against

the CDC CASPER Toolkit question bank to assess whether it could provide the desired

situational awareness.


A.      BACKGROUND

        On Friday, February 8, 2013, a major winter storm dumped massive amounts of

snow across the northeastern United States, which was severe enough that The Weather

Channel named the storm Nemo, even though winter storms are not traditionall       y given

names. 65 Boston, Massachusetts was heavily impacted by the storm, with hundreds of

thousands of residents left without electrical power. Public transportation in the Boston

metropolitan area was shut down for days, and a driving ban was instituted f or the entire
state. The city received approximately 25 inches of snow, which makes it the fifth- largest

snowstorm ever recorded in the city. Logan International Airport was closed, with

thousands of flights canceled. 66 The U.S. Postal Service even canceled     mail delivery.

Several people died because of the storm, including at least two people in Boston who

died from exposure to carbon monoxide while sitting in running vehicles to keep warm.   67

        Boston had significant difficulty plowing the roads due to the extr eme snowfall.

Residents of the Jamaica Plain neighborhood complained of roads not being plowed

several days after the storm. Boston Mayor Thomas Menino even issued an apology for

the slow pace of snow removal in the city. 68

B.     METHOD

       The hashtag #bosnow was s elected for in depth analysis, as it was primarily

specific to storm- related events in the Boston metropolitan area. While hashtags like

#blizzard2013 and #nemo had more overall posts, an initial evaluation suggested that

these tags were less likely to con tain the specific situational awareness desired by the
researcher. Tweets denoted with the hashtag #bosnow were saved using The Archivist

application at six different times between February 9 and February 12, 2013, each

approximately 12 hours apart (mornin g and evening), which resulted in six data files,

each containing approximately 1,500 tweets. As The Archivist application selects the

most recent 1,500 tweets, in some cases, tweets were present in more than one dataset.
After removing duplicate tweets, 6,807 tweets were analyzed from the #bosnow hashtag.

While not a complete collection of #bosnow tweets from the event, the large volume of

information is useful in answering the research questions. Table 2 details when the

datasets were acquired.

        The #bosnow hashtag became a useful source of information about school
closures in the Boston metropolitan area during the aftermath of the storm.

Approximately one-third of all tweets using this hashtag shared s omething about schools.

Looking at this series of tweets from an hourly perspective yields an interesting

discovery. Nearly all comments about schools occurred during two separate hours,

Sunday, February 10 from nine a.m. to ten a.m., and Monday, February           11, from one

p.m. to two p.m. Also, most posts mentioning school closures were retweets. Twitter user

@YourTownQuincy tweeted “http://t.co/Kk9kYmd7 #Quincy working to restore power.
No word yet on school closing for Monday #bosnow”        69 at 8:37 a.m. on February 10. By

8:58 am, the same user reported, “#Quincy Public Schools closed tomorrow #bosnow.”         70


        In addition to sharing school closure information by retweeting, users often

expressed both pleasure and displeasure related to the operating status they were
reporting. User @vonflakes posted ““@mayortommenino: Boston Public Schools will be

February 11, 2013.

        The operating status of businesses and government institutions were also topics of

discussion, with a few mentions of the status of Logan International Airport. Tweets

about government status comprised about 1% of all #bosnow tweets, while posts about

business status were about 3% of the total. Tweets about Logan International Airport

were only 0.3% of the conversation. During the same time that tweets about school

closures were dominating (Sunday morning, 2/10), government status tweets appear to be

heavily retweeted. However, a closer look revealed that the bulk of those retweets were a
message about the status of City Hall that also included closure information about Boston

schools, so it is possible that the driver behind the retweet preference was the school

status information. Andrew Ryan posted “@Boston_Police just called 24 -hour hotline 6

times in a row. No answer. Recorded message. Filed my issue on web #bosnow.”          73User

@TedCanova shared “Waiting for an early Valentine’s card? Not today! Mail delivery
                                                                           74

discovery made while analyzing tweets from this category was from a post by Craig
Silva, which lead to an analysis of another hashtag, #openinbos, “Want to know what

stores/restaurants are open in #Boston? Check out the #openinbos hash tag. #BoSnow

#Nemo.”   75 The hashtag #openinbos spontaneously emerged in the aftermath of the

snowstorm. Users gravitated to this hashtag to discover and share information about

businesses able to open despite the massive snow accumulation. Over 75% of the tweets

provided information about Boston- area businesses open during the storm, and many of

the rest were notices of business closures or inquiries about open businesses. User

        People also used the #bosnow hashtag to share weather information about their

specific locations. During the beginning of the event, specific weather updates were a
very large part of the conversation among tweets labeled with #bosnow. As the event

progressed, the amount of specific weather updates declined significantly. Overall, tweets

with specific weather updates comprised 17.5% of all tweets using this hashtag. Weather

updates of a more general nature followed a similar trend of declining over time, but were

more likely to be ret weeted. General updates, even at their peak during the onset of the

storm, were much less common than those that were more specific, and comprised

approximately 8% of all tweets from #bosnow. Weather updates of both specific and
general natures typically contained links. While the links contained in tweets were not

systematically analyzed as part of this project, a cursory review indicates that these are

primarily links to image files. Mike Petroff inquired, “Where did our bottom two stairs

go? #bosnow @WBU          R http://t.co/tCKPHANj,”    77   and a similar post from @

holycowcollect “um, where the heck did the street and car go? #brighton #BOSnow
                                                                                           78
#Nemo #blizzard http://t.co/AMD92Zjo http://t.co/waikUAWB via @breakingnews.”

General weather updates were obviously less specific, such as a retweet by @ZachVento
“RT @BostonGlobe: PHOTOS: Scenes from across the state as residents dug out from

the snowstorm. http://t.co/9L80pkj1 #bosnow #blizzard”.      79 When specific and general

        Information about the status of area roads, while not dominant immediately

following the storm, was a popular subject of discussion on #bosnow. Road status

updates were frequently retweeted, and commonly contained links (presumably images).

Comments about roadways were a steady topic of discussion for tweets containing the
#bosnow hashtag, which comprised almost 13% of the total. The discussion contained a

variety of road-related topics, such as this tweet from Lillian Chan “driving ban still and

        Updates from official sources exhibited a curious phenomenon. Original tweets

containing official updates specific in nature were somewhat rare in occurrence, at only

about 7% of all #bosnow tweets. However, these types of tweets were very likely to be

retweeted by other users. For example, official updates were retweeted more than 10

times for each original tweet from this category. Updates that were more general in

nature were not retweeted so heavily, and were less common, and comprising under 4%

of #bosnow posts. Messages from official sources were shared throughout the incident.

        Examples of specific updates include a retweet by @RoslindalePatch “RT

@NotifyBoston: We hear you- we’re taking many calls. Crews will be out there working
                                 87
on streets all night. #bosnow,”     which was also retweeted by six other Twitter users.

This retweet from @krejcismoxie was also retweeted by 21 others, “RT @NotifyBoston:

http://t.co/HLDH3Zgj #bosnow.”     88


        General updates from official sources included “RT @NotifyBoston: Please RT:

continue to stay off the road to allow public works/emergency vehicles to operate.
#bosnow,”  89 from user @BostonFoodLove, which was also retweeted by 27 others.


        Posts offering advice were also heavily retweeted, and s      hared during all time

periods analyzed. Tweets in this category comprised approximately 6% of the total

volume of posts from this hashtag. These posts offered citizens actions they could take to
protect themselves, request services, and other actions to he          lp them endure     the

aftereffects of the snowstorm.


        Twitter user @NewBostonians shared, “The threat of carbon monoxide poisoning
is real. Do not start your car until you have cleared the tailpipe. #bosnow.”         90 “RT

        Updates originating from media outlets also were somewhat popular for

retweeting, although not at the same rate as information from officials. At the beginning

of the storm, media information was being widely shared and retweeted. Media

organizations tweeted much less often during the latter part of the blizzard. Zachary

Vento retweeted, “RT @BostonGlobe: PHOTOS: Scenes from across the state as
                                                                                            92

Ronald Agrella retweeted this media post, “RT @usatoday: Super snowstorm ‘Nemo’ has

been blamed for at least four deaths in New York and Canada. http://t.co/e6sSy9SW

#bosnow.”  93


        Shortly after the storm, tweets containing information about electrical power

status were relatively common. Many of these updates contained clues about location.

While many tweets were individual reports of power outages, such as a post from

@DDDM9, “No power since midnight. Layers, hat and scarf on while laying in bed! Cats
have icicles !! #Blizzard2013 #BOSnow #blizzard,”       94many posts described the general

status of electrical power service. Jessica Bartlett retweeted this information about

Duxbury, “RT @ DuxFDEM Duxbury is about 90% without power, many roads are

impassable and it will be several days until full restoration. #bosnow,”  95 and Art Beecher

retweeted, “RT @YourScituate: 100% of people without power in #Scituate according to

necn #bosnow.”   96  Some tweets contained information about phone service and other

utilities, such as cable television, but these were rare. Posts about electrical power status

were almost 7% of all #bosnow tweets.

        Another topic receiving a relatively steady stream of updates was information

related to public transportation. While mass transit tweets were not overly frequent, and
represented less than 3% of the total, they were a constant topic for tweets over the

course of the storm. Zach Tucker retweeted, “RT @BostonAttitude: T           he MBTA says

they will not be able to restore services today #BoSnow,”       97 while Scott Luther put a

personal touch on his post, “@mbta down all day. Guess I’m staying in #southie

#bosnow.”  98 Progress by officials trying to restore service was also a topic of discussion,

including @HatchetHagearty, who reported, “#MBTA is reporting that the empty snow -

clearing trains are running on time! #congrats #nemo #bosnow,”       99 and this update from

Kyle MacDonald, “MBTA now running limited service on C and D lines. #bosnow

#nemo #mbta.”   100

        People turned to #bosnow to ask for help from each other during the aftermath of

the snowstorm, but those tweets were only just over 2% of the conversation. Many

requests were general in nature that asked people to check on elderly neighbors a nd stay

off the roads, for example, and were often retweeted. User @The_Divine_Ms_D was one

of many to retweet, “RT @NotifyBoston: Please RT: continue to stay off the road to

allow public works/emergency vehicles to operate. #bosnow.”          101 Later in the event,

original tweets asking for assistance began to increase. Boston Mayor Tom Menino had a

tweet that was popular for retweeting, including by Alemitu Kassa “RT

@mayortommenino: Be good neighbors; take care of one another. Check on elderly
                                                                102
residents. Call us with concerns: (617) 635-4500. #bosnow.”        Twitter user @kianiistarr

even shared this important update, “@notifyboston There is some one trying to take their
mother to dialysis treatment! We need to plow riverdale road ASAP #bosnow.”        103

        In addition to requesti ng help, Twitter users also offered assistance on #bosnow,
but it was less common. Tweets of this nature comprised less than 1% of the total

analyzed from this hashtag. User Shane Dunn made this offer, “Happy and able to help

anyone in #Southie who needs a       little help digging out today. Be safe, folks. #nemo

#bosnow.”  104


        Residents used #bosnow for both complaints and praise in roughly equal numbers,
with slightly more complaints than thanks. Each comprised about 1% of the conversation.

While not common compared to the overall number of tweets, Twitter and the #bosnow

hashtag made it possible for citizens to communicate directly to officials involved in the

response. Examples included praise for a specific official action, such as from

@Lynelleluvs, “Thank you for snowplowing my street #bosnow,”           105 and specific items

needing attention, like this post from @SynBoga, “Plows driving up and down already
                                                      106
cleared roads. Side streets still waiting... #bosnow,”    were found in this hashtag.

        Tweets were found relating information about how the storm was impacting their

health, although they comprised less than 2% of the total. These tweets shared

information about people that died from the storm, such as a retweet from @Mephisto808

“RT @WBUR: Trying to stay warm inside car            while shoveling out, Boston boy dies:

http://t.co/KuQk9qYN #MaSnow #BoSnow.”               Tweets also mentioned issues like the

effects of the cold from shoveling or lack of heating, including this tweet from Kate
Birney “No heat. No power. For hours now. It is so col        d it hurts. #nationalgridfailure

#cityofquincy #nemo #BOSnow #wbur.”         108 Mental health pressures from being trapped

in their houses were also mentioned, such as user @rachelwrites007, who tweeted,

“@amabe421 I’m determined to trek about outside, even if its f or a few minutes today.

#Boston is a ONEin3er! Know any elderly neighbors who cld use som e help shoveling??

#InstantKarma #BoSnow.”     110


        Additionally, information that citizens could use to keep themselves safe and

healthy was also available, such as clearing the exhaust before operating vehicles to

prevent carbon monoxide poisoning, including Noah Reiter, who tweeted, “2 killed from
CO poisoning in Boston post - #nemo Clear exhaust pipes of vehicles and home furnace

vents http://t.co/5JDpunkr #bosnow.”    111 The same number of these health information

tweets were posted as those about health impact. Both health updates and health

information were widely retweeted.

        Twitter users also utilized #bosnow to offer empathy and support to those dealing

with the aftereffects of the snowstorm. Posts were both personal in nature, such as “good

to hear! “@SimmonsCollege: How is everyone doing? We made it through the night

safe+sound and now we’re just waiting it out! #bosnow,”“             112  by Whole Foods

Symphony, and more general in nature, like a tweet from Laura Elkman, “Thinking of

you #boston from #atlanta! #nemo #bosnow with @catherinvaritek

http://t.co/h9P1SIEb.” 113 Posts of this nature were less than 1% of the #bosnow tweets

analyzed.

        In the days following the blizzard, tweets about the Adopt     -A-Hydrant program

increased. This program encourages residents to volunteer form       ally to keep a hydrant

near their residence free from snow (also clear of vegetation during warmer months), so

that firefighters can easily find them.114One particular tweet, from @AlertBoston, which

was heavily retweeted, contained images from a nearby fir       e where responders had to

clear snow to access the hydrant. The text of the tweet was, “Fire on Mather St. shows

        The #bosnow hashtag also contained reports of flooding resulting from the storm;

however, they were less than 1% of the dataset analyzed. These repor              ts included

        The #bosnow hashtag also contained a small volume of tweets about shelters for

local citizens, which amounted to less than one -half of 1% of the total. Hi awatha Bray

tweeted, “#bosnow A few dozen people in Quincy shelter. Recharging their phones like

me. More arrivals expected as night comes on,”        127  and @YourTownQuincy shared,

        Many tweets contained Internet links, but did not have any textual clues as to the

content of the post. These links were not explored, but over 51% of #bosnow         -tagged

tweets contained a link.

        As Twitter is open for use to anyone willing to complete the brief en      rollment

process, it is not surprising to find that some tweets did not relate to the loose structure of

the hashtag #bosnow. What was unexpected was that the overall volume of tweets that
were completely unrelated to the hashtag comprised a very small por tion of the overall

tweet volume. Analysis found that most of the off      -topic tweets occurred towards the

beginning of the time period studied. Further analysis of this category shows that the

majority of the off-topic tweets are retweets of this particular post, such as from MariAn
Gail Brown, “RT @chowandchatter: Road sign humor RT @smebulok: RT

@bmgallagherjr: Only in New England. #bosnow #nemo http://t.co/ZKzgiXNZ.”                129

Since approximately 2/3 of all off-topic posts were retweets of this specific post, the l ink

was investigated, which revealed an image of a road sign stating, “The roads are wicked

slippery.” Along a similar vein, a small but steady collection of tweets used the storm as a
springboard to talk about something tangentially related. Examples are tweets that used

the storm as an excuse to discuss global warming. Another popular tangent involved

making a play on the name of the storm (named Nemo by some news outlets) to the

Disney movie “Finding Nemo.”

        Tweets were also coded if they contained mentions about personal experiences

during the storm. An example is a tweet mentioning what the user is having for dinner, or

a mention of a movie the user is wat ching during the storm. While many useful posts,
such as weather updates, contained personal comments of this nature, personal comments

that did not contain situational awareness were combined with tangent and off-topic posts

to create a usefulness categor  y. Surprisingly, the vast majority of #bosnow tweets
conveyed at least some information about the storm.

D.     CASPER-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS

       Data obtained with the #bosnow hashtag contained many elements identified in

the CASPER toolkit. This information can help agencies improve their response after a
disaster.


       1.      Identification and Physical Location

       The suggested questions in this category allows the researcher to note the location

of the person intervie wed. While Twitter users do not typically include their address in

their Twitter profiles, location clues were readily available from the tweets studied. The
#bosnow hashtag effectively filtered discussion so that tweets with that hashtag primarily

related to events in Boston during and after the snowstorm. Jess Infante shared, “Door

knob height snow at the back door. Not going anywhere anytime soon. #blizzard




                                            44
                                                      131
#bosnow #Charlestown pic.twitter.com/za21zI2R.”           Her post demonstrates the type of

location information typically found on the hashtag. It is reasonable to assume that the
post references the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston.


        Also, while not part of this study, Twitter gives users the option to include their

latitude and longitude with their posts. A        dditionally, many smartphone cameras
                                                         132
automatically add geographical information to photos.


        2.      Demographics

        For the most part, much of the information in this section that the CDC

recommends was not found in tweets with the #bosnow hashtag. However, many post               s

could be assumed to be referring to the users’ primary residence, as evidenced when

reviewing tweets about weather updates. For example, it is a reasonable assumption that

Twitter user @pandanichols spent the night at their primary residence based on the           ir

tweet, “Anyone else’s street look like mine? @universalhub we’re snowed in completely
                                                             133
on Chesterton. #BoSnow #blizzard http://t.co/1046f8Mu.”

        While people did not use Twitter to report that they did not feel a need to

evacuate, shelters were mentioned.      Hiawatha Bray reported “#bosnow A few dozen

people in Quincy shelter. Recharging their phones like me. More arrivals expected as

night comes on.”      134   Other tweets about shelters included a query from

@ScituateQDPhoto, “Hearing there may be a warming station at Deer Hill School in
                                             135
Cohasset, can anyone confirm? #bosnow,”          and “#Quincy is offering to drive people to
                                            136
shelter. Call 617 376 1105 #bosnow,”             from @YourTownQuincy. Tweets about

shelters comprised only a minute fraction of the total tweets analyzed from         #bosnow.

However, the news media did not report widespread evacuations from this weather event,

so the low volume of tweets about shelters is unsurprising.


        3.      Damage and Repair


        Twitter provided a great deal of information in this category. Although no tweets
were found describing damage to a residence from the storm, #bosnow was widely used

to share details about the impact of the storm on individuals. Many posts even included

pictures of snowfall, such as a tweet from Curt Nickisch, reporting, “Tree-damaged car in

Jamaica Plain: @ WBUR #bosnow pic.twitter.com/Iejgn4wB.”               137  Tweets sharing

information about the extent of the weather were very common, which comprised about

25% of all tweets studied from this hashtag, with those relating specific information

about the extent of the weather comprising the bulk of the volume. This post from user
@ddayhere is fairly representative of the type of specific weather updates found,

“#bosnow Out the window this morning. The wheels are covered with snow.

http://t.co/Gr12vuXe.”  138


        Some information about flooding in the area was also tweeted, including
“Salisbury orders mandatory evacuation of beach residents; giant surf damaged two

homes in 200 block of No. End Blvd. #BoSnow,”           139 and “Big waves, but no major

flooding in Revere. “We were fortunate,” Revere Fire Chief Gene Doherty.

#BoSnow,”“   140 both from Kathy McCabe. As the primary issue with this storm was

snowfall, it is not unexpected for tweets about flooding to compromise less than 1% of

overall tweets.

        Twitter users also shared information about their cleanup efforts, which for this

storm, primarily consisted of snow removal. Twitter user @mcledin mentioned, “The

digging out has begun #bosnow #boston #blizzard           http://t.co/0uLQP0S3.”141 Daniella

Santos shared a post typical of those       about shoveling, “Back at it again! Morning

shoveling. #blizzard2013 #bosnow #Snomageddon @cbsboston @JimCantore
http://t.co/A25hS4EP.”  142 While people really did not use the #bosnow hashtag to report

that they lacked the resources or ability to clean up, r eports asking people to help each

other were discussed, such as this from @ONEin3, “Take a break from playing in the

snow and check on your elderly neighbors who may need some help shoveling!

#InstantKarma #BoSnow.”      143


        4.      General Utilities


        The #bosnow hashtag was an excellent source for information about utilities.
Electrical status was a popular topic for discussion, which comprised almost 7% of all

tweets studied from #bosnow. Many of these tweets relayed the electrical status of

individual residents, such as this post from @persoconchii, “*counts her lucky stars* ok..

so Quincy in general has no power, but we in N. Quincy (Quincy Shore Dr) got ours

back! hoorah!! #bosnow,”    144Other posts detailed the extent of overall outages, including

a tweet from Ted Canova, “Boston power outages- Hyde Park hardest hit: 2,800 out of

Boston’s 10,000 without power. h/t @phillipWGBH #Bosbliz #Bosnow.”             145 Telephone,

garbage, and natural gas were also discussed, but were much less common. The CDC

recommends asking about what type of           heating source a person is using after a
         146
disaster.    While #bosnow did not offer answers to that question, many users reported

on
the lack of heat in their residences, including Kate Birney, “No heat. No power. For hours

now. It is so cold it hurts. #nationalgridfailure #cityofquincy #nemo #BOSnow

#wbur.”  147

        5.     Carbon Monoxide Exposure

        While Twitter was not an ideal way to learn how many local residents were

potentially exposed to carbon monoxide, quite a few posts warned other users about the

risks of carbo n monoxide, and reported the deaths of residents killed from exposure.

Tweets about carbon monoxide were frequently shared with others by retweeting,
including “Definitely watch out for deadly carbon- monoxide poisoning if you are stuck

or clearing car. Clear exhaust pipe. #bosnow,”         148 from The Boston Globe. As

demonstrated above, Twitter did provide decent information about power outages, which

public health agencies could use as an indicator of carbon monoxide exposure. When the

power goes out, people may be more likely to use generators and grills, which can release
deadly carbon monoxide.


        6.     Animal Safety

        Questions in this category relate to threats to safety from animals after a disaster.

Mosquitoes, snakes, and alligators were the only animals specifically m       entioned, and

obviously, those would be unlikely to pose a significant threat after a major snowstorm.

Questions in this section did not relate to pets or livestock, although #bosnow tweets did
discuss pets.


        7.     Supplies and Relief

        A lot of information in this category in tweets used the hashtag #bosnow. The first

group of CDC suggested questions relate to drinking water. No tweets were noticed in

#bosnow that discussed drinking water availability. Some users complained of dwindling

food supplies, and others r eported businesses that were open, sometimes expressing

gratitude at having found something besides the provisions they had remaining. Timothy
Scholl shared, “Anybody know if there are any stores open in Jamaica plain, preferably

Hyde sq or Jackson? Need l      aundry detergent &amp; dinner supplies. #bosnow.”         149

Tweets using the #openinbos hashtag were mostly related to sharing information about

    149Timothy Scholl, Twitter post, February 9, 2013, 4:42 p.m., https://twitter.com/stopaction.

                                             48
businesses open to the public after the storm. User @sugarplum1125 provided a typical

example, “#openinbos whats open in boston for food need something in back bay for my
hotel guests #backbay #hotel140 #boston #nemo.”      150


        The lack of available transportation in the area was also a big topic for discussion.

Governor Patrick’s driving ban was a popular subject, including a comm           ent by Sean

Leahy, “No driving ban needed here. Nature (with help from plow) imposes its own 30”
                                                    151
barrier. #bosnow #snow…      http://t.co/8GB94kHa ,”    and “When will MA driving ban be

lifted? @MassGovernor Patrick spokesperson: Governor “will reassess midday.”
                      152
#BosBliz #Bosnow,”        from Ted Canova. Public transportation was also mentioned on
#bosnow. Many tweets simply relayed the status of mass transit in the area, but some

described the direct impact of not having transportation, such as Amanda Kendrick’s

post, “Can’t get to church because the T is closed, so we’re watching live from the fort.

#winning #bosnow http://t.co/GnmoLywo.”        153 A similar tweet came from Twitter user

@MyOmegaCentauri, “No barbershop for me because the #MBTA is still pretty much

shutdown. AY Cabin Fever has set in. I love snow but it’s Snowmageddon #BoSnow.”           154

        The final suggested question in this section asks a person what their greatest need

is at the moment. Twitter is a useful platform to obtain information of this sort. While it

is not possible to determine if a tweet is the most important need of the user, the fact that

this person bothered to post something implies some amount of importance. Such an

open-ended question can allow researchers to identify issues previously unrecognized.

For instance, many Twitter users reported roads that had been neglected by plows to

Boston Mayor Menino’s Office of Constituent Engagement Twitter account

@NotifyBoston. JJ Foley’s Café reported, “@NotifyBoston Oakview terrace Jamaica
                                                                               155

Mitchell mentioned, “@NotifyBoston #bosnow Mt. Vernon St in Dorchester(near Boston

St) hasn’t been plowed. Thank you for all your hard work.” 156


       8.      Health Status

       Information was available about health status using the #bosnow hashtag. People
reported minor injuries from snow shoveling, anxiety and stress from being stuck in their

residences. Deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning were reported, as mentioned in the

carbon monoxide section.


       9.      Medical Care and Prescriptions

       One person shared how the snow was preventing someone from receiving care for

a chronic condition. The #bosnow hashtag did not appear to offer any information about
whether people had enough prescriptions to last until the snow could be cleared.


       10.     Communication

       These questions assess what source an individual primarily uses to obtain

information, and whether this person reports receiving any warnings. As previously

mentioned, Twitter was a good source of information about threats faced by citizens,

such as that from carbon monoxide, fire hydrants buried in snow, and other hazards.
Another useful feature of Twitter for this section of a CASPER is retweeting. Many

messages on #bosnow were frequently retweeted by other users. Understanding what

types of posts are likely to be retweeted can help responders increase the reach of their

messages.

E.     WORD CLOUD


       It is readily visible from Figure 11 that posts providing information about schools
were a large part of the overall tweets on #bosnow, which matches the     findings of the

researcher. Figure 12 shows the same word cloud after the most frequent words have

       In this chapter, the hashtag #mastorm is explored. Background is provided on the
specifics of the weather event under study. Method details specific to this dataset are

presented. Similar to the previous chapter, the data are then presented and analyzed with

a comparison to the CASPER toolkit.


A.     BACKGROUND

       The major snowstorm that affected Boston on February 8, 2013, also affected

large portions of the rest of the state of Massachusetts, among other states in the northeast

region. In preparation for the storm, Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick enacted a

statewide driving ban, Amtrak trains were sidelined, and the state’s largest airport, Logan

Airport, was closed.159 Nstar and National Grid reported more than 375,000 customers
                                                                               160
without power in Massachusetts, primarily in the southeastern part of the state.   Even
                                                                     161
the Pioneer Valley, in western Massachusetts, reported heavy snowfall.


B.     METHOD

       The hashtag #mastorm was selected for in depth analysis. It was selected because

the name indicated that it might contain information about storm -related events specific

to the state of Massachusetts. Tweets using the hashtag #mastorm were saved using The
Archivist application at six different times between February 9 and February 12, 2013,

each approximately 12 hours apart (morning and evening), as shown in Table 3, which

resulted in six data files, each containing approximately 1,500 tweets. As The Archivist

application selects the most recent 1,500 tweets, in some ca ses, tweets were present in

more than one dataset. After removing duplicate tweets, 4,065 tweets were analyzed from

event, the large volume of information is useful in answering the research questions.

C.     DATA AND GENERAL ANALYSIS

       Tweets with the hashtag #mastorm contained plenty of information about the

impact of the storm on the state of Massachusetts. Figure 13 shows the overall volume of

tweets analyzed for this chapter, and are organized by the hour the tweet was posted.
Figure 14 shows an overview of the content contained in the tweets studied.

               Figure 14.  Total volume of #mastorm tweets by category


       Overall, about 75% of tweets using the #mastorm ha       shtag were retweets, as

illustrated by Figure 15.

                  Figure 15.   Proportion of original tweets and retweets


        While the #bosnow hashtag contained a significant number of tweets related to

school closures, #mastorm contained very little mention of school closure informati       on,

and comprised less than 1% of all #mastorm tweets studied. One tweet that was retweeted

by five others was “Fall River just canceled school for Monday, indicating concern about
                                                                   162
length of cleanup. #MAstorm #snowRI (h/t @Will_Richmond).”

        Once again, the operating status of businesses, government, and airports were

discussed on #mastorm. These tweets were also likely to be retweeted. Information about

airports was a bit more frequent than on the #bosnow hashtag, but still less than 1% of the
total volume of tweets analyzed. While no hashtags similar to #openinbos were found,

people did inquire about and report on the operating status of businesses. The Sentinel &

Enquirer, a newspaper in Fitchburg, MA, referred users to their Facebook page by

posting, “Do you know of a supermarket, coffee shop or gas station that’s open? Share
                                            163
here: http://t.co/IKyL2MLq #MAStorm.”           Tweets about businesses and government

each accounted for over 2% of all #mastorm posts in this analysis.

        Massachusetts Governor, Deval Patrick’        s tweets, under the user name

@MassGovernor, were popular for retweeting, including a submission by @JMengz001,

“RT @MassGovernor: Asking all non-           emergency state employees to stay home

tomorrow. #MAStorm.”     164

        Much like with the #bosnow hashtag, users shared specific and general weather

updates using the #mastorm hashtag; however, those updates were not as frequent. Also

similar to #bosnow, tweets using #mastorm usually contained links. Weather updates of

both types occurred throughout the storm. John Casey shared this post, “Aftermath in

#Somerville #Nemo #MAStorm http://t.co/HL2sMrfZ.”         165 Another update shared a few

times was the tweet from Gina Tomaine, “Dude, where’s my car? #MAstorm #nemo
                                                                      166
#boston #blizzard #brighton @universalhub       http://t.co/sRHCJfvA .”    Specific weather
updates were slightly more common than general ones, with each comprising

approximately 7% of the total volume of tweets for this hashtag.

        People using the #mastorm hashtag shared a significant amount of information

about the status of roads foll owing the storm. On February 9, from about 12 p.m. until 2

p.m., tweets talking about roads dominated the conversation tagged with #mastorm.

While that tapered off, roads were a relatively constant theme during the time period

analyzed, which accounted for over 28% of all #mastorm tweets studied. Other users also

very heavily shared roadway information via retweeting. However, very few of these

tweets about streets and highways contained links or images. Over one -third of all tweets
(N=392 of 1165) in this category were retweets from @MassDOT, the official account of

the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, such as “RT @MassDOT: #MAStorm:

I-90E/W now open to propane and tandems from the New York Border to Springfield -

Speed Limit remains at 40 MPH.”     169 Another third of the posts (N=444 of 1165) in this

category were retweets from MA Governor Deval Patrick, including, “RT

@MassGovernor Driving ban lifted immediately 4 Nantucket County &amp; for all
                                                    170
communities west of I-91 #MAStorm #ynnsnow.”

        Updates from official sources followed a similar pattern as the #bosnow hashtag.

While original tweets with specific official information were much more common than

on #bosnow, these types of tweets were very heavily retweeted by other users. Specific

official updates were shared throughout the storm, and comprised more than 22% of all
#mastorm tweets in this study. Specific updates of this nature were primarily relating to

the status of roadways. More general in nature Updates were far less frequent, and

consisted of only approximately 1% of the conversation, but were also often retweeted,

such as “RT @MassGovernor: For all snow storm related tweets from MA state gov’t,

follow #MAStorm.”    171

        One popular tweet for retweeting ended up being truncated, “RT @MassDOT:
#MAStorm: Statewide Travel Ban remains in effect all Massachusetts Roads. Crews total

3600+ overnight plowing roads. Avoid ...”      172  The retweeting process added a few

characters to the new tweet, and the actual advice was no longer clear.


        Official advice was a v ery popular theme on #mastorm, and comprised almost

19% of the total volume of tweets from this hashtag, and was often retweeted. Advice
was provided on a variety of subjects, including this retweet by @DISASTER911UT

“RT @MassEMA: Reminder: Call 211 for shelter and other information if needed. Save

911 lines for emergencies. #MAStorm.”       173 Also, Renato Rodriguez retweeted, “RT

@MassEMA: If you still have power, keep your cell phones fully charged in the event of

a power outage #Mastorm.”    174

        Media outlet updates were less common on #mastorm than #bosnow, but they

were also frequently retweeted. These media posts were just over 4% of the total

conversation studied. User @Wadmissions retweeted, “RT @BostonGlobe: SNOWFALL

TOTALS: See how much your area received: http://t.co/fIPFffiT #bosnow #mastorm

#blizzard #nemo.”   175  Media tweets offered general information about the storm,

including a retweet from @Shelshand, “RT @BostonGlobe: VIDEO: Powerful waves

crash against homes, streets flood from nor’easter. http://t.co/t1Nw        3JLa #bosnow
                     176

        Tweets containing information about electrical power service were very common

on #mastorm, during the entire time period studied, and were commonly retweeted.

Unlike #bosnow, however, most did not contain clues about loca tion, but were broader

updates, including @TwoOsinGoose who retweeted, “RT @MassEMA: 12AM (2/9)

outages in MA (rounded): NGRID 168K, NSTAR177K, Total 345K generally southeast

who posted, “In Quincy ma and power off for two hrs already n counting. #mastorm

#blizzard2013 gonna be a long nite. God bless n stay safe n warm!”           178 Posts about

electrical power status comprised almost 20% of all tweets studied using the #mastorm

hashtag.


        Similar to #bosnow, sporadic reports of the operating status of other utilities, such
as phone and cable television, were also posted, but they were very rare.


        Mass transit related tweets were more common on #mastorm than on #bosnow,

and were retweeted at a higher frequency. This category of tweets comprised over 6% of

all #mastorm posts analyzed. The Massachusetts Department of Transportation
(@MassDOT) tweeted, “#MAStorm: #MBTA Service remains suspended, all routes,

today, Saturday, Feb. 9. http://t.co/PvUNmLQP,”      179 which was retweeted by 49 other

users.


        People only made a few requests for help using the #mastorm hashtag, which

makes this category far less than 1% of the total conversation. Karen Winsper posted,
“@NSTAR_News Hoping that my dead end stre et in Rochester is not last on your list!

No power=no heat and no water too. #MAstorm @MassGovernor.”            180


        A few tweets also reported on people who had volunteered to help others in some

way. Adam Coombs posted, “My family shoveled out my elderly neighbor. He looked so
                                                   181
happy. There were tears in his eyes. #Mastorm.”

        Using Twitter to say thanks to someone was more common than for complaints,

but many of the thankful tweets were retweets towards the end of the storm. The bulk of

the retweets offering praise were two very similar tweets, one from the Massachusetts

Emergency Management Agency that shared, “Special thanks on 2/11 to @Mass_211

@Mass_211 workers helping w/ #MAStorm response &amp; all year in sharing free

resources for local services. #211Day.”       183  Similar to tweets on roadways from

@MassDOT, these tweets became truncated when retweeted by other users, e.g., “RT

@MassEMA: Special thanks on 2/11 to @Mass_211 workers helping w/ #MAStorm

response &amp; all year in sharing free resources for local ...”. 184Posts offering thanks to

someone consisted of roughly 2% of #mastorm tweets.


        Complaints were var ied, but mostly focused on the driving ban imposed by
Governor Patrick, such as “@massgovernor #Mastorm There is a part of the state called

“Western Massacusetts,” May we please drive now your highness?”           185 These critiques

were about 1% of the conversation on #mastorm.


        Health impacts from the storm were not shared frequently on #mastorm, and

comprised well under 1% of all tweets with this hashtag. Just a few reports appeared,

including one from Patrick Delahanty, “Although the #MAstorm is over, remember to
check in on the elderly or disabled. I’m going to go rescue @nigoki now...”.    186 However,

information about how to prevent a health impact from the storm was fairly frequent, at

over 3% of the conversation. This actionable information was also highly retweeted,

including this post from @lirael_abhorsen, “RT @SomervilleCity: When shoveling, be

sure to clear snow from appliance vents outside to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning

#MAstorm #Ne ...,”    187 and another from Jeff McQueen, “RT @MassEMA: Another

        Twitter users also demonstrated some empathy when using the #mastorm hashtag.
Similar to #bosnow, posts were both specific, such as Edwin Diaz who tweeted, “ Omg!!

stay safe up there RT @gto maine: Dude, where’s my car? #MAstorm #nemo #boston

#blizzard #brighton @universalhub http://t.co/t6T4rxNF,”     189and more general in nature,

including one from Judy Converse, “Thinking of family &amp; friends back east in the

grip of #MAStorm! Stay warm and s afe everyone!”       190Tweets in this category comprise

less than 1% of the total volume studied.

        Adopt-A-Hydrant information was shared on #mastorm, and comprised about 8%

of the conversation; however, most of those tweets were posted at the beginning of the

time period studied. During the first few hours of the storm, many retweets reminded

citizens about the program. Some tweets specifically mentioned the program, while

others simply reminded people to clear hydrants in their area. “ RT @MassEMA: When

shoveling, please help dig out nearby hydrants! It could save lives during a fire
             191
#MAstorm”       was retweeted over 300 times.

        People also used the #mastorm hashtag to ask questions of other users. Many

were specific, including a question from Jackie Troche, “Anyone kno         w where to get

wood or gas in Plymouth? #MAStorm,”       192 and another from JJBoston, “Any hotels with

heat and power in Plymouth MA area?? Looking to book 3 rooms for a few days ASAP
            193
#mastorm.”      These inquiries comprised less than 1% of the conversation, and, si milar
to #bosnow, did not appear to be answered.


        Reports of flooding were also noticed on #mastorm. The Boston Globe posted this

tweet, “VIDEO: Powerful waves crash against homes, streets flood from nor’easter.
                                                              194

longer active, so the video could not be reviewed. These posts were uncommon, and

comprised less than one-third of 1% of the conversation.


        Quite a few tweets mentioned shelters opened because of the storm, which

comprised over 4% of all #mastorm tweets studied. Many were truncated again when the
message was retweeted by other users, including Christine Thompson, “RT @MassEMA:

RT @massgov: If you’ve lost power and/or heat due to #MAStorm, you can get local

shelter &am p; warming center information b ...”        195 Other users like @Aline_Carr

recognized this, and modified the tweet to read, “ MT @massgov Lost power or heat due

to #MAstorm? Call 211 for local shelter &amp; warming center info. #nemo #blizzard
         196
#hmrd.”     The “MT” typically stands for “Modified Tweet,” and indicates that someone
                             197
has altered the original text.

        The hashtag #mastorm, like #bosnow, had numerous tweets that contained a link,

but did not have any contextual clues about what the link referenced. These links

comprise about 1% of all tweets, but were not investigated. Over 28% of all #mastorm

posts contained a link.

        Similar to the #bosnow hashtag, tweets using #mastorm primarily related to the

winter storm, but unrelated tweets were posted throughout the event.

        Adding personal experiences that did not also contain situational updates, as was

done for the #bosnow chapter, shows that #mastorm posts were even more likely to have

some level of situational awareness than #bosnow (see Figure 18).

D.     CASPER-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS

       As with the analysis of #bosnow tweets, those using the #mastorm hashtag were

compared with the CDC CASPER question bank.


       1.      Identification and Physical Location

       The suggested questions in this category allow the researcher to note the location

of the person interviewed. Similar to #bosnow, many tweets using #mastorm had clues to

the location being discussed. Using a hashtag was a common method, such as a post by

@CohassetBOH, “Power is o ut all throughout #Cohasset. Follow @CohassetBOH to

receive continuous updates of the response. #MAstorm @CohassetMariner.”      198 The post

seems to refer to power outages in the town of Cohasset. Other posts simply mentioned
the name of the location in question, including @starsfadeaway, who tweeted, “Westfield

22 inches, Springfield 15 inches. It’s still snowing #Mastorm.”199

                                            66
        2.     Demographics


        Much like with #bosnow, demographic information was somewhat limited, but
much could be inferred from the context of a twee      t. Someone posting, “Seeing snow

drifts of at least 3’ on deck and in driveway. Went out twice last night with the

snowblower too. #MAStorm #blizzard2013 #revere” probably spent the previous night at

at the house. Information about whether someone owned or           rented a home was not

noticed in tweets from this hashtag.

        The hashtag #mastorm was not really used to report that a user needed to evacuate

or use a shelter, but information about shelters was shared and widely retweeted. The

town of Cohasset, MA shared the following tweets, “Some things not to bring to the

#Cohasset Charging Station: car batteries and the like @MassRegion4b
@CohassetMariner #Mastorm,”       200  and “Thank you to the #NationalGuard for

transporting 5 #Cohasset residents to the @RedCross regional s        helter in Weymouth

@MassRegion4b #Mastorm.”       201


        3.     Damage and Repair

        Once again, Twitter was an excellent source to learn about damage from the

storm, as #mastorm contained a wealth of posts reporting on local conditions. One post,

which was retweeted by several users, describes roof damage, “RT @MassEMA: Why

roof clearing is important: MT @SNEWeather partial roof collapse at house in
                                                        202
Marlborough Mass http://t.co/8hJb7YlD #MAstorm.”            The link goes to a picture that
was shared on Twitter, but not using #mastorm or any other hashtag (see Figure 19). The

#mastorm hashtag also contained many updates describing personal updates on the

impact of the storm, often containing images. Twitter user @meobrienii offers an

example of a typical personal update, “The view from o         ur apt from door #boston

#mastorm #blizzard #southend    http://t.co/abVWG1wY.”  203

        While flooding was not a significant issue following the storm, local reports of

flooding were found on #mastorm, as well as more generalized discussion regarding

flooding. Massachusetts State Senator Bob Hedlu nd posted, “Much of Distr still coping
Atlantic Av Hull hit hard Breakwater wiped out. Scit Shelter very busy. Staff there

working very hard. #MaStorm.”      206 User @MassDCR posted, “Be glad ur NOT driving:

        While it was less common than on #bosnow, Twitter users also used the

#mastorm hashtag to report on cleanup activities. Similar to #bosnow, clean up primarily

consisted of shoveling snow. Nelly Do provided a typical example: “#Time for an #upper
                                                                                         208
#body #workout with #shoveling #snow :) #mastorm #blizzard http://t.co/3Nashviy.”


        4.      General Utilities

        The #mastorm hashtag was popular for sharing information about electrical power

outages following the storm. Unlike #bosnow, however, tweets were less likely to have

location clues. While some were personal, such as a post from Brett Rossi, “10:30am

update: No power. Radio says it won’t be restored until Sunday night. We think we only

got a foot. #MAstorm,”   209 most were general in nature, like @MassEMA “10AM (2/9)
                                                                                           210
outages in MA (rounded): NGRID 164K, NSTAR 249K, Total 413K #MAstorm.”

Very few references to utilities other than electrical service were posted, but a few did

mention phone and cable services.


        5.      Carbon Monoxide Exposure

        Similar to #bosnow, #mastorm was not used to self        -report exposure to carbon

monoxide. However, Alex Bloom reported, “Five taken to #Brockton Hospital for carbon

monoxide poisoning. Family was heating apartment using gas stove
                                      211
http://t.co/NwCbmzFe #MAStorm.”           Additionally, a moderate amount of information

was posted on ways people could protect themselves from carbon monoxide exposure,

including a plea from @OccupyNemo, “If you lose heat, do not heat home with gas
stove/oven! The carbon monoxide can kill! #Nemo #MAstorm (1).”         212

        6.      Animal Safety


        Once again, this category is seeking to understand what threat, if any, is posted to

local residents from wildlife, including mosquitoes and snakes. Information on this
subject was neither found nor expecte d on #mastorm. Although not part of the CASPER

questions for this section, people did mention pets on #mastorm, much like with

#bosnow.


        7.      Supplies And Relief

        The hashtag #mastorm contained a lot of information about supplies and relief. A

lack of potable water did not seem to be a significant problem following the storm, and

was not discussed much in the tweets analyzed. However, Karen Winsper did mention

“@NSTAR_News Hoping that my dead end street in Rochester is not last on your list!

No power=no heat and no water too. #MAstorm @MassGovernor.”           213 A few reports also

contained instances of dwindling food supplies, including one from Phillippe Patry, “We
                                                                                          214
have lots of beers but no food. The storm is bad ! #MAstorm #bostonblizzard.”
Timothy P. Murray provided a ty pical post about available disaster relief, “If you’re still

in need of local services like housing, food, or clothing in the aftermath #MAStorm, Dial

2-1-1 for free resources #211Day.”     215 While a hashtag detailing open establishments

similar to #openinbos w as not discovered, information was available about the status of

businesses where people could replenish supplies. The Sentinel & Enterprise created a

clearinghouse of sorts by directing users to their Facebook page: “Do you know of a

supermarket, coffee shop or gas station that’s open? Share here: http://t.co/IKyL2MLq
#MAStorm.”    216


        Much like the #bosnow hashtag, #mastorm was used frequently to comment on

the lack of transportation because of the storm. Many people used #mastorm to express

their feelings on the statewide ban on driving in Massachusetts, such as


    213Winsper, Twitter post.

                                             70
@Call_Me_Clumsy, who tweeted, ““@MassGovernor: We will let you know when the

travel ban is lifted. But for now, the ban is still in effect. #MAStorm” Soon
pleaseeeeeeeee.”  217Twitter users also shared information on the status of the driving ban,

including the Sentinel & Enterprise, “BREAKING NEWS: Gov. Patrick lifts driving ban

for Nantucket, west of I -91 immediately; rest of state at 4 p.m. #MAStorm.”       218 Public

transportation, mostly the MBTA in Boston, wa s also discussed. An example retweeted

several times was a post from the Massachusetts Department of Transportation:

“#MAStorm: #MBTA service remains suspended today, Sunday. Goal: restoring service

on Monday, Feb 11. Latest: http://t.co/39539nTV.”     219

        Once again, many clues about the greatest needs of residents were available from

tweets with the #mastorm hashtag. Lucy Costa inquired “Any recommendations for

selecting a good generator and generator safety tips? Asking on behalf of church

members. #mastorm #pr eparedness.”      220 User @effigies asked on behalf of a friend,

“Friend, with &lt;1yo son, without power near 500 Hancock St. in Quincy. Anybody

know if there’s anywhere with power in the area? #MAstorm.”       221


        8.      Health Status

        Much less information was available on #ma storm regarding the health status of

Twitter users than on #bosnow. As mentioned in the previous section, some reports were

posted about carbon monoxide exposure, but no reports appeared concerning minor

injuries, unlike #bosnow. Information that could be used to protect health was common,

and widely retweeted, including @massgov “@MassEMA If you have lost power, don’t

use the gas stove or oven for heat. #MAStorm.”    222

       9.     Medical Care and Prescriptions

       Medical care and prescription information was not discussed on #mastorm.


       10.    Communication

       The CASPER questions try to determine where people are getting their

information, and whether they have heard any disaster response information. The hashtag
#mastorm was widely used to share information. As mentioned in previous s     ections,

information on carbon monoxide was frequently discussed and often retweeted, including

specific actions that people could take.


E.     WORD CLOUD

       Similar to the #bosnow hashtag, the word cloud in Figure 20 provides a quick
way to review some of the most popular words contained in #mastorm. It is apparent that

Twitter users frequently mentioned the travel ban; therefore, it was removed for Figure

21. Other themes identified in the research, including hydrants (fire hydrants), outages,

shoveling, start to become clear in Figure 21, after the most frequent words have been
removed.

                          V.     #CAPECODSTORM



       This chapter analyzes the hashtag #capecodstorm, and is organized similar to the

previous two chapters. Background and method details specific to the hashtag are
discussed. Data is first presented, then analyzed, and compared against the CASPER

framework. Finally, a word cloud is included.


A.     BACKGROUND

       The winter storm investigated during the previous chapters also had a significant

impact on the Cape Cod area of southeastern Massachusetts. A significant portion of the
                                              225
cape was left without power following the storm.

B.     METHOD DETAILS


       The hashtag #capecodstorm, while not very active overall in terms of tweet
volume compared to #bosnow or #mastorm, still contained a significant amount of useful

information about the storm. The hashtag was selected to evaluate whether a hashtag that

was named for an area with a smaller population might have differing information from

the hashtags for larger areas.

       Tweets using the hashtag #capecodstorm were saved using The Archivist

application at six different times between February 9 and Februar y 12, 2013, each
approximately 12 hours apart, as shown in Table 4. After removing duplicate posts, 123

tweets were analyzed from the #capecodstorm hashtag.

C.     DATA AND GENERAL ANALYSIS

       Figure 22 shows the overall volume of tweet      s analyzed during this study,

organized by the hour the tweet was posted. Figure 23 shows an overview of information

contained in the tweets studied. About one   -third of tweets with the #capecodstorm

hashtag were retweets, as shown in Figure 24.

                  Figure 24.   Proportion of original tweets and retweets


        The hashtag #capecodstorm was not used heavily for tweeting information about

school closures or operating status . Only approximately 3% of #capecodstorm tweets

(n=4) contained information about schools. Three of the four school -related tweets were

from the Cape Cod Times Twitter account (@capecodtimes), while the last was a retweet

of this Cape Cod Times post, “Upda        ted #CapeCod school closure list just posted:
http://t.co/brgpnH0Y @capecodtimes #capecodstorm.”       226


        Business status information was a bit more popular than school status on

#capecodstorm, at just under 5% of total tweets. Once again, the Cape Cod Times was
responsible for all the tweets in this category, including “We have a bunch of

cancellations, early school dismissals, forecasts, emergency numbers, more

http://t.co/Z9bIs9r8 #capecod #capecodstorm.”      227  Sixty-six percent were original

@capecodtimes tweets, and the remainder were retweets of @capecodtimes posts. Only

one tweet was about government status.

        Weather updates, both specific and general, were shared on #capecodstorm, much

like on the other hashtags studied. Over 10% of tweets with the #capecodstorm hashtag


    226Cape Cod Times, Twitter post, February 10, 2013, 2:28 p.m., https://twitter.com/capecodtimes.

       Cape Cod Times, Twitter post, February 8, 2013, 9:52 a.m., https://twitter.com/capecodtimes.
                                             78
contained specific weather updates, while over 5% contained general weather updates.

Over 60% of those specific updates and 100% of the general updates contained links.

Over one third of the specific weather updates and just over half of the general updates

were retweets. One specific update was, “A portion of Winter St. in Hyannis is closed

due to trees in the road. Shiver me timbers. @capecodtimes #capecodstorm
                         228
http://t.co/K8KkLy45.”       The Cape Cod Times again dominated general weather

updates. While only two posts, including “Check out this snowstorm gallery from our
staff photographers http://t.co/AKCaZ6F5 #capecod #capecodstorm,”         229came from the

@capecodtimes account, when retweets are included, six out of seven posts originated

from @capecodtimes.

        Information about roads was shared on #capecodstorm, with over 10% of tweets

sharing roadway information. Nearly 70% of road- related tweets contained links, and

almost half were retweets. The Cape Cod Times was again a major part of tweets from

the #capecodstorm hashtag in this category, as almost half of the twee     ts were from its

account, and a few more were retweets of its posts.     For example, the Cape Cod Times

tweeted, “ Video: Mid -Cape road conditions and interview with snowplow drivers:
                                                       231
http://t.co/nf52CrSf @capecodtimes #capecodstorm.”

        Official updates behaved differently from the other hashtags studied. The only

tweets providing official updates were those that only provided general information.

Tweets providing more specific updates were not retweeted. Also, general tweets

comprised approximately 7% of the total #capecodstorm tweets, and were shared in the
beginning of the storm. Specific official updates were grouped later in the event, and

comprised less than 3% of all #capecodstorm tweets.


        While some official advice was given on #capecodstorm, it comprised than 3% of
the total tweets, with two -thirds coming from the Cape Cod Times. The Brooks Free

Library posted, “MEMA: If you have property damage, document w photos or video.

Check w/ insurance for coverage. Keep records of repair costs #capecodstorm.”     232

        Media outlet updates were relatively common on #capecodstorm, which

comprised over 12% of all tweets on the hashtag. Nearly half (47%) were retweets. Some

of the most common were announcements that the online version of the Cape Cod Times

was free during the storm, such as “@CapeCodTimes newspaper delivery delayed due to
                                                                              233
storm. Read our replica edition online: http://t.co/8IIzZ8cb #capecodstorm.”

        Tweets about power status were the most common category of tweet on

#capecodstorm and comprised approximately hal f of all posts. Over one -third of posts

using this hashtag were retweets. Approximately 25% of tweets in this category were

from @capecodtimes, and another 50% were either retweets of @capecodtimes posts, or
were replies to that Twitter account. It was eas    y to get a sense of how many Cape

residents were without power by reading tweets in this category, such as “UPDATE: As

        Mass transit was not mentioned on #capecodstorm.

        People only made a few requests for help using the #capecodstorm hashtag. All

these were asking for assistance to restore electrical service, including Lisa Morales, who

tweeted, “@capecodtimes please send them to Robbins Cir,Dennis. No septic pump! Out
                                    235
since Friday eve. #capecodstorm.”

        People did not utilize #capecodstorm for offering thanks at all, and only one

complaint was posted.

        Impacts to health from the storm were not reported. Three tweets contained

information related to health. One was from @capecodtimes, “Cape Cod Hospital and

Falmouth Hospital will be open during the storm. #capecodstorm

http://t.co/AVCzeLwd,”   236 and the other two were retweets of this message.

        Just one tweet expressed support for people dealing wi th the snowstorm, which

came from Lindsey Lu, “@suecovemanser Sue do you have power? We don’t, day 4.

Stay safe. #capecodstorm #ivan.”   237

        Unlike the #bosnow and #mastorm hashtags, fire hydrants were not mentioned by

anyone using the #capecodstorm hashtag. Also, no tweets requested information.


        Flooding was mentioned in approximately 6% of tweets using #capecodstorm.

While three out of the seven tweets were from the Cape Cod Times, all other posts about
flooding were either retweets of @capecodtimes tweets, or mentioned them by including

“@capecodtimes” in their tweet. Over 40% of flooding-related tweets were retweets.

                               #capecodstorm http://t.co/ZzLDqiBz.”


        Just over 3% of #capecodstorm tweets mentioned shelters in the Cape Cod area.

The Cape Cod Times accounted for 75% of those tweets, including “Three Cape

emergency shelters to open at 3 this afternoon: Sandwich HS, Nauset HS            , D -Y HS
                                                    239

retweeted.

        Only one tweet contained a link with no clues about the content of the link.

        Tweets using #capecodstorm were predominantly related to the topic. Just one

tweet was only tangentially related, from the Brooks Free Library, “If you have power

       Adding personal experiences that did not also contain situational updates, as was

done for #bosnow, shows that #mastorm posts were even more on-topic than #bosnow.

D.     CASPER-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS

       Following the same methodology as with #bosnow and              #mastorm tweets,

#capecodstorm tweets were compared with the CASPER question bank to evaluate the
value of the hashtag for disaster epidemiology.


       1.      Identification and Physical Location


       This category seeks to determine the location of the people being interviewed.
Departing somewhat from the other hashtags, many posts using #capecodstorm did not

contain location clues beyond the hashtag itself. While Cape Cod is home to only

approximately 220,000 year round residents,         it comprises over 300 square miles.

Tweets with #capecodstorm were less useful in providing location information than the
other hashtags. However, some users did provide additional location clues, including Lisa

Morales, who shared, “@NSTAR_News I’m bummed to be part of the 58% of Dennis

without power. 22 hours and counting! #capecodstorm #Blizzard2013 #CapeCod.”           243


        2.      Demographics


        The #capecodstorm hashtag contained far fewer personal updates than the other

hashtags studied, but citizens still used it to report on local conditions. Similar to the

other hashtags, in many cases, it could be inferred through the context of the tweet that a
person did not choose to evacuate. For example, Lori Ann Higgins posted, ““That’s

us!RT @capecodtimes: About 28K #CapeCod #NStar customers still without power:

http://t.co/o6sv27E0@capecodtimes #capecodstorm””.      244


        Much like the other hashtags studied, #capecodstorm was not used to discuss

personal evacuations due to the storm, but information about shelters was available. The

Cape Cod Times, which played a nearly const           ant role on #capecodstorm shared,
“Falmouth officials say community shelter to open at 3 pm at Falmouth High School

http://t.co/Z9bIs9r8 #capecod #capecodstorm.”    245


        3.      Damage and Repair


        This hashtag was much less useful in documenting the damage from the storm

than the other hashtags studied. Information was available; however, the volume of

tweets was much lower for #capecodstorm. The information available was similar to that
found in the other hashtags, such as this update from @capecast, “It’s not just trees that

        Relative to the small amount of total tweets on #capecodstorm, flooding was a

common topic. Moira Swiatkowski’s tweet, ““RT @capecodtimes: Flood concerns rise in

#Sandwich as high tide approaches at 10 a.m. http://t.co/KOfF2tHy @capecodtimes
                   247
#capecodstorm”,”      and ““Video of flooding on River Road in #Sandwich and high tide
at Town Neck Beach: http://t.co/KOfF2tHy @capecodtimes #capecodstorm”,”              248 from

the Cape Cod Times were typical posts related to flooding.


        4.      General Utilities


        Information about electrical power service was very prevalent on #capecodstorm,

which comprised about half of all tweets studied. Reports were both personal, as
evidenced by a question tweeted by Lisa Morales, “@suecovemanser Sue do you have

power? We don’t, day 4. Stay safe. #capecodstorm #ivan,”        249 and general to the cape

area, such as this Cape Cod Times post, ““About 28K #CapeCod #NStar customers still

without power:   http://t.co/3y52JyQ0@capecodtimes #capecodstorm.”       250A few of reports

mentioned heat, but it was unclear whether their heat was electrical or from another type

of fuel. Kristen Elise posted, “No power and no heat ..nice. #blizzard #capecodstorm
                         251
http://t.co/iA5q3NQB.”       References to other utilities, like phone or natural gas, were

not found.


        5.      Carbon Monoxide Exposure

        Unlike the #bosnow and #mastorm hashtags, no tweets discussed carbon

monoxide exposure. An Internet search did not reveal any reports of carbon m         onoxide

poisoning in the Cape Cod area during the storm. Although, the Cape did experience

widespread power outages, warnings to residents about the risks from carbon monoxide

were not shared using this hashtag.


        6.      Animal Safety

        Again, this category of questions did not really apply to a winter storm in the New

England areas. Mosquitoes and other vectors are not significant problems after heavy

snowfall.


        7.      Supplies and Relief

        The hashtag #capecod storm did not offer much information about supplies and

relief. Users did not use this hashtag to discuss food and water supplies. No tweets were

identified that discussed businesses open to supply the public with goods. Some local

shelters were mentioned, including “Three Cape emergency shelters to open at 3 this
afternoon: Sandwich HS, Nauset HS, D              -Y HS http://t.co/Z9bIs9r8 #capecod

#capecodstorm.”   252


        Information about how the storm impacted travel was available on

#capecodstorm. The statewide driving ban was only mentioned in a few tweets. However,
a fair amount of infor mation was posted about local roads. Dhyana Sansoucie reported,

“Out and about. Lots of trees down along 6a in sandwich -                     still passable.

@capecodonline.com #capecodstorm,”       253 and @capecast shared, “A portion of Winter

St. in Hyannis is closed due to trees i   n the road. Shiver me timbers. @capecodtimes
                                         254
#capecodstorm http://t.co/K8KkLy45.”

        Clues about the greatest needs of local residents were not widely discussed on

#capecodstorm, although a few posts indicated needs, including one from Lisa Morales,

“@BostonDotCom why do I care when I have no power, heat or septic pump? Bully for
                                 255

       8.      Health Status

       As previously mentioned, #capecodstorm was not used to share any information

about the impact of the storm on the health of the population. Additionally, information

that can be used to protect health was not available either.

       9.      Medical Care and Prescriptions


       The only tweets sharing information about medical care were previously
mentioned tweets noting that area hospitals would remain open du         ring the storm,

including ““RT @capecodtimes: Cape Cod Hospital and Falmouth Hospital will be open

during the storm. #capecodstorm http://t.co/AVCzeLwd.”   256


       10.     Communication

       The hashtag #capecodstorm did offer some limited insight into information about

the sto rm, but was much less useful than the other hashtags studied. The hashtag
#capecodstorm was obviously the hashtag that local news agency, The Cape Cod Times,

used to offer updates to local residents on Twitter. The Cape Cod Times dominated

conversation on #capecodstorm. Fully 30% of all tweets using this hashtag originated

from @capecodtimes. Another 46% of tweets using @capecodstorm were retweets of
Cape Cod Times posts, or mentioned @capecodtimes in the tweet. Only about 24% of the

total tweets were unrelated to the Cape Cod Times.


E.     WORD CLOUD

       The word cloud in Figure 28 is even more informative than that for the previous

hashtags studied. As previously mentioned, tweets about power outages comprised about

half of the posts studied in this chapter. It is ea sy to see how dominant that issue was for
this hashtag. In an interesting departure from #bosnow and #mastorm, once the most

frequent words are removed, as shown in Figure 29, few issues seem to come to the

surface.

       VI.    FINAL DISCUSSION, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND
                                 CONCLUSION



       This chapter begins with discussion of overall findings and recommendations for

organizations seeking to implement or enhance a social media plan to improve their
incident response. Concluding remarks follow the discussion and recommendations.


A.     DISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

       •      Public health agencies face shrinking budgets, and traditional met hods of
              gaining situational awareness are resource intensive. Can social media be
              used to provide situational awareness to public health and other responders

              during an emergency?

       This study found that Twitter activity provided a rich source of data about current
emergencies and events that public health and other responders could use to increase their

situational awareness. Reports of an ambulance stuck in snow, impassible roads, and

unplowed streets can help responders adjust plans to a changing situation. Reports of
neglected areas can help officials better provide services to their constituents. The local

updates from citizens can help agencies understand which areas were impacted most

heavily from the storm, particularly those tweets about damaged prope       rty and

infrastructure. Learning which businesses are able to provide goods and services to the
public can take some of the burden off relief agencies. The CASPER analyses conducted

in this study demonstrate that many elements of a traditional RNA are available on

Twitter, but it would supplement, rather than replace, a CASPER.

       The City of Boston’s @NotifyBoston was an example of a creative way to gain

situational awareness from the public. Mayor Thomas Menino’s Office of Constituent
Engagement runs the ac count. City employees regularly responded to tweets, which

provides both general information and direct answers to specific questions from

constituents. Staff members of @NotifyBoston even passed information to appropriate
agencies when notified of an issue via Twitter. Members of the public had a clear way to

provide local updates to the Mayor’s staff about roads that needed plowing or other issues



                                         89
needing attention. Public health and other agencies could mimic this approach, and create

a specific Twitter account designed to receive individual reports directly from the public.

        In a related vein, the media made effective use of Twitter during the winter storm

by requesting information from users of the platform. While most media inquiries were
seeking personal stories instead of critical situational awareness, public health responders

could request desired information in a similar fashion. Both @NotifyBoston and the

media provided a direct way for the public to provide information. This approach could
be a su ccessful method of easily obtaining useful information from an event that

generates a large volume of Twitter activity.

        Information discovered from the hashtags studied can provide responders with

feedback that can be used to improve their response, and a djust a tactic not working as

desired. The hashtag #mastorm provided a reminder to state officials that a statewide

driving ban might have been too extreme, as users posted information suggesting that the
western part of Massachusetts was much less impacted than the eastern part. Boston

residents also used #bosnow to mention that snow removal crews were neglecting the

Jamaica Plain neighborhood.

        The #openinbos hashtag demonstrates one method of how Twitter can be used by

public health and other responders. Businesses and consumers used #openinbos to find
and share information about establishments open in the aftermath of the snowstorm,

which allowed citizens to replenish supplies, obtain meals, and enjoy some recreation

during a weather event that left many people stranded in their homes. Citizens that can

feed and supply themselves could lessen the burden on agency responders, which also
provided responders with information about what type of services were available to the

public. Public health professional s could leverage the #openinbos example, and create

specific hashtags to share information more effectively. For a response with a heavy

focus on vaccine, something like #vaxinbos, for example, could be used to focus local
discussion on vaccine related iss ues in the Boston area. Such a hashtag could even be

specifically tailored to provide updates on vaccine locations, or other items of interest.


While nothing forces a user to respect the intended topic of a hashtag, the analysis of

                                             90
tweets in this study s uggests that users predominantly follow the topic of a hashtag on

Twitter.

        General situational awareness was certainly available from the hashtags studied.

Snowfall totals and impacts to roads were frequently reported. Electrical power status
was commonly posted and retweeted. The status of schools, mass transit, and businesses

was often shared using these hashtags. Twitter was able to offer quite a bit of information

about the snowstorm and the impact on the communities involved. While much of this
information was likely available through traditional media, tweets are to the point and

easy to read quickly. Agencies could use their Twitter feeds to stay abreast quickly of

important news, in addition to seeking information unavailable elsewhere.

        •      If social media can provide situational awareness, how can a public health
               agency leverage this technology with limited financial and human

               resources?
        Crude analysis is possible without requiring any technology or equipment, beyond

basic office equipment, such as a computer and Internet connection. Applications, such as

TweetCharts.com, are available to assist responders in targeting their search for relevant
hashtags. Public health responders can implement a program to perform surveillance on

social media with very little training or additional resources.

        The word clouds presented in this paper can even provide an organization with a

good starting point if it wants to obtain a general sense of what is being discussed on a

particular hashtag. The researcher found that d    ownloading a series of tweets with a
specific hashtag, and creating a word cloud, could be accomplished in a few minutes.

Agencies should remember that a word cloud would not provide any context; therefore,

the exclusive use of word clouds might make it di fficult to determine if the public was

positively or negatively receiving a particular topic. However, it is a simple way of
generating keywords for more detailed analysis. A somewhat deeper analysis can be done

by removing the most frequent words, includi ng extraneous ones, as demonstrated in the

previous chapters.

        Manual review of tweets to determine what situational awareness is contained

within is not an efficient process. In the short term, a list of keywords could be developed

                                             91
for each type of emergency. Keyword searches would reduce the time required to

perform tweet analysis, but missing important pieces of information could be a risk if the
keyword list was not exhaustive. Post     -event analysis could continually improve the

keywords used.

        For the long term, public health agencies should work with information

technology experts to find ways to automate content analysis of Twitter conversations.

Ultimately, it would be preferred to develop applications that can use sophisticated
algorithms to classify content to allow the rapid analysis needed to allow the information

contained within a hashtag to presented be quickly to incident decision makers. Even if

those applications required a human to interpret the results, automated sorting could still

greatly decrease the amount of time required to analyze tweets during an emergency.

        Many different groups and organizations have explored software applications to

analyze tweets, as discussed during the literature review. At the time of this study, none
was ready f or off-the-shelf use by public health and other emergency responders. The

digital age has been one of rapid progress; therefore, the development of these tools

should be monitored. These applications should be evaluated as they become available.

        Official agencies may be releasing tweets without considering hashtag usage. A

hashtag is not needed to reach an existing network of followers, but without one, agencies
risk missing the opportunity to engage with other users. A service like Tweetcharts.com

could be used to identify popular hashtags relating to an event, and tweets could be

repeated with multiple hashtags (if all relevant tags do not fit within the 140 character

limit imposed by Twitter). Using popular hashtags related to an event can help an agency
increase the reach of its message, by making the posts more visible for users who do not

already follow official agency social media accounts. This study found that users were

likely to retweet messages that contain useful and relevant information.

        Agencies that tweet during the aftermath of a disaster should use caution when

drafting their messages. Although many official tweets were popular for retweeting by
other users, the retweeting process adds precious characters, and many of the tweets

evaluated were truncated as a result that frequently left the meaning of the tweet in


                                             92
question, and sometimes shortened Internet links so that they were unusable. A good

practice might be to include the most important part of the message at the beginning of
the tweet to minimize content loss from truncation. Another tactic could be to use less

than the allowed 140 characters, perhaps only using 120 characters, to save room for

retweets.

        The analysis of tweets from this storm found that links were commonly attached

to postings. A cursory review found that many of these links were images. This study did
not attempt to analyze images systematically from tweets relating to the snowstorm. It

would be advantageous to find a solution to enable responders to view images associat ed

with an event quickly. While text queries could be used to narrow the list of tweets down

to those claiming to contain the specifically desired information (such as road conditions,
for example), this analysis found numerous tweets that contained no clues as to the

content of the attached images. Viewing all images associated with a large event would

be as daunting as reading every tweet, even though images can convey a great deal of

information. A method to categorize and view images easily and quickly would be
tremendously useful to responders.


        This study did not attempt to determine if the tweets were geocoded, due to
limitations of data obtained using The Archivist. Exploring the use of geocoded social

media posts would be useful for public health and     other responding agencies. Knowing

precise locations for tweets providing actionable information could allow authorities to
direct resources more efficiently. Tools that can easily display tweets on a map would

help responders quickly identify locations with unresolved issues.

        Any new policy, technology, or process should have measures of success, and

using Twitter for situational awareness is no different. Agencies should gauge the success

of the program through surveys conducted after every disaster response. Feedback from

incident responders is essential to determine if this new method for gaining situational
awareness is providing useful information, and how it could be improved. The social

media team from a public health agency should also conduct an a          fter action review

specific to the use of social media during the event. This review should seek ways to
improve speed and efficiency, as well as other areas for continual improvement.

                                             93
        Twitter is just one of numerous social media applications. Although the         public

nature and short message limits make Twitter an attractive research platform, other

platforms may also contain elements useful to public health and other emergency

responders. It would therefore be worthwhile to explore methods to integrate these s ocial

media applications into the response effort. Additionally, MySpace offers a cautionary
message about focusing efforts on just one social media platform. At one point, MySpace

was the most popular social media platform in the world. However, things change

quickly on the Internet, and the barriers are low for creating a competing technology. In a

relatively short timeframe, Facebook was able to surpass and ultimately eclipse MySpace

as the dominant social media platform.     259 Therefore, public health and ot her response

agencies should maintain awareness of other social media platforms, and follow users if
they migrate to other applications. As Figure 30 illustrates, migration on social media is

not an instantaneous event, but occurs over time,     260 which should allow public health

agencies plenty of time to adapt to changing preferences and technologies. A final point

about emerging social media networks is that they are not mutually exclusive.

Responding agencies could certainly use multiple platforms. Social me           dia platforms

should be explored as they emerge.

B.     CONCLUSIONS

       This study demonstrates that useful situational awareness is actively being posted

and shared using Twitter. Social media has given amplification to th e voices of ordinary

citizens, which allows them to connect with emergency responders easily. However, a
conversation requires more than one party. American citizens are increasingly using these

social media platforms to communicate, not just with each oth er, but also with agencies

that serve the public. Due to the increasing importance of this communication channel, it

would seem irresponsive, perhaps even irresponsible, for government institutions to
ignore social media.


       Admittedly, the immense volume of information available on Twitter and other
social media platforms can be intimidating; however, dealing with challenges is perhaps

one of the few constants in the world of managing complex incident management. Tools

and tactics discovered during this resea rch and by other researchers can help a nascent
agency engage their constituents. The time for emergency responders to join the social

                                           95
media age has already passed, but the opportunities remain available for any organization

willing to invest the time and energy.

A.      CAN TWITTER PROVIDE PSYCHOLOGICAL FIRST AID?

        Any public health response to disaster needs to consider psychological first aid

(PFA). The National Response Framework (NRF) includes mental health services in the

Emergency Support Function #8, Public Health and Medical Services Annex.        261After a

typical disaster, it is likely that far more people will report psychological symptoms than
              262
physical ones.    According to the Minnesota Department of Health, PFA is a strategy to

reduce painful emotions by providing an environment with the following features.

        •      Safety

        •      Calm & Comfort

        •      Connectedness

        •      Self-Empowerment

        •      Hope
        PFA is designed to be useable by anyone, without a need for advanced

psychological training or education.263 It is intended to provide assistance with a victim’s

immediate needs, and not to treat psychological disorders.264


        The primary weakness of psychological first aid is that it has not been rigorously
evaluated by clinical trials or other controlled research studies. However, a literature

review commissioned by the Advisory Council of the American Red Cross Disaster

Services found widespread agreement among professionals that the tactic was effective
and appropriate for untrained providers.  265


        Social media may offer the ability to deliver psyc     hological first aid to affected

areas in the aftermath of a disaster. Social media technology allows people to interact

regardless of location. Most social media applications are free of charge and relatively

easy to use. Additionally, social media platfor ms like Twitter, which limits posts to 140

characters, have been shown to be resilient. A key advantage of Twitter is that the low
bandwidth of a short message will often be delivered on an overloaded or damaged cell

network, while a phone call may not.   266


        A study of a series of natural disasters in New Zealand and Australia in 2011

found evidence that social media can assist in delivering psychological first aid. Through

a survey, respondents indicated that they felt connected and useful by using social media
                     267
during the incident.

        The Veteran’s Administration and the National Child Traumatic Stress Network

jointly developed the Psychological First Aid Field Operations Guide (hereafter referred

to as The Guide), which is designed to guide responders of various backgrounds through

the process of delivering PFA. The guide outlines eight core actions of PFA.     268

        •       Contact and Engagement

        •       Safety and Comfort

        •       Stabilization

        •       Information Gathering: Current Needs and Concerns

        •      Information on Coping

        •      Linkage with Collaborative Services

        To test the hypothesis that social media applications can provide effective PFA,
an analysis was performed using data collected for this study. Tweets from the #bosnow

hashtag were compared to the elements of PFA as described in The Guide.


B.      CONTACT AND ENGAGEMENT


        •      Goal: To respond to contacts initiated by survivors, or to initiate contacts
               in a non-intrusive, compassionate, and helpful manner.

        The Guide advises, “Even a brief look of interest      and calm concern can be
grounding and helpful to people who are feeling overwhelmed or confused.”     269


        Analysis of #bosnow tweets revealed that Twitter users offered empathy and

support for residents affected by the massive snowfall. Posts were both personal in
nature, such as “good to hear! “@SimmonsCollege: How is everyone doing? We made it

through the night safe+sound and now we’re just waiting it out! #bosnow,”     270and more

general in nature, like “Thinking of you #boston from #atlanta! #nemo #bosnow with

@catherinvaritek  http://t.co/h9P1SIE“.271 Support of this nature was offered throughout

the recovery from the storm.

        Additionally, some examples of people initiating contact were evident, which

could provide an opening for responders to provide assistance. An example was

“@amabe421 I’m determined to trek about outside, even if its for a few minutes today.
                             272
Going stir crazy! #bosnow,”

C.      SAFETY AND COMFORT

        •      Goal: To enhance immediate and ongoing safety, and provide physical and

               emotional comfort.
        The Guide mentions several issues to address under this function, the first of

which is to ensure immediate physical safety. Tweets with the #bosnow hashtag

contained information that citizens could use to keep themselves safe and healthy, such as

clearing the exhaust before operating vehicles to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning,
including “2 killed from CO poisoning in Boston post     - #nemo Clear exhaust pipes of

vehicles and home furnace vents http://t.co/5JDpunkr #bosnow.”     273Another element of

ensuring immediate safety in The Guide is to encourage survivors to contact relatives.

Analysis found some tweets providing reminders that the elderly may need assistance,

like “RT @ONEin3: Not everyone in #Boston is a ONEin3er! Know any elderly
neighbors who cld use some help shoveling? ? #InstantKarma #BoSnow”.        274 Tweets of

this nature were widely retweeted, which increases visibility of the message.

        The next item mentioned in The Guide to enhance safety and comfort is to

provide information about the disaster response, what to do next, and available services.

A wealth of information about the response effort was present in the tweets studied.

Tweets gave situational updates, such as the extent of power outages, information about

shelters, efforts to plow roadways, and what businesses and i nstitutions (such as schools
and city hall) were operational. People were urged to remain off the roads to allow

authorities to clear snow.

        Another suggestion from The Guide in this section is to encourage social

engagement. Using a hashtag like #bosnow on       Twitter provides a forum for people to

share and discuss how the storm was impacting their lives. A large portion of the tweets

from this hashtag was from people posting pictures of the amount of snow in their
immediate area.

        A final item in this section where social media has been proven useful is to help

survivors who have missing family members. While missing people were not a part of the

tweets studied, examples appear in the literature about the use of social media for
families and others to update ea ch other on their status. After the 2010 Haiti earthquake,

residents used Facebook and Twitter to communicate their status, which was particularly

effective in areas in which phone lines were unavailable.275


D.      STABILIZATION (IF NEEDED)

        •      Goal: To calm and orien      t emotionally overwhelmed or disoriented
               survivors.

        The Guide mentions that most people affected by disasters will not need

stabilization, which is intended for victims with obvious signs of being overwhelmed or

disoriented. Social media may not be directl y useful in this regard. However, tweets on
#bosnow urged people to check in on friends or family that might need help. If that

advice is heeded, those individuals could provide assistance. Further research would be

needed to claim the utility of social media for this activity.


E.      INFORMATION GATHERING: CURRENT NEEDS AND CONCERNS

        •      Goal: To identify immediate needs and concerns, gather additional
               information, and tailor Psychological First Aid interventions.

        This activity involves an effort to understand the scope of an individual’s

experience, and customize the intervention to those needs. Since Twitter is primarily an
open platform for anyone to view, it may not be an appropriate vehicle for this type of

personal conversation. However, Twitter does allow privat e, direct messaging between

two users, so it would be possible for a public health agency to survey individuals

privately to understand their specific needs. Research would be needed to demonstrate

the effectiveness of this intervention.

F.      PRACTICAL ASSISTANCE

        •      Goal: To offer practical help to survivors in addressing immediate needs
               and concerns.

        Numerous examples of tweets used the #bosnow hashtag, which offered ways to

obtain practical assistance. As noted in The Guide, when people obtain needed resources,

they can offer them hope and empowerment.     276One tweet offered, “#Barnstable PD says

area residents who need shelter should go to Cape Cod Hospital, where Nat’l Guard will
                                     277
help find the closest one #bosnow.”     Another tweet offered, “If you need help, or have
neighbors who need assistance, get in touch with/follow @OccupyNemo. #Nemo

#Bosnow.”  278 Even more specific was this offer, “#Quincy is offering to drive people to

shelter. Call 617 376 1105 #bosnow.”  279


        Another form of practical assistance after a severe snows torm is helping people

find food and supplies from vendors able to open their doors. The hashtag #openinbos
spontaneously emerged in the aftermath of Nemo. Users gravitated to this hashtag to

discover and share information about businesses able to open des pite the massive snow

accumulation. Over 75% of the tweets provided information about Boston-                area

businesses open during the storm, and many of the rest were notices of business closures

or inquiries about open businesses. User @andrav23 retweeted “RT @tplepage: Shaws at

the Pru is #openinBOS until 5:00 PM. Long lines though and may not find what you
                                    280
need. @universalhub http://t.co ...”


G.      CONNECTION WITH SOCIAL SUPPORTS

        •      Goal: To help establish brief or ongoing contacts with primary support
               persons and other sources of support, including family members, friends,

               and community helping resources.

       As previously mentioned, social media including Twitter has been used to help

families and friends locate each other after a disaster. Additionally, Twitter in particular
was shown to be functional when other modes of communication were damaged.


       Another suggestion from The Guide is to encourage people to lean on those who
are available when loved ones are not around. Many forms of support mentioned in The

Guide were displayed on #bosnow tweets and include emotional support, social

connection, advice and information, physical assistance, and material assistance. Tweets
with these attributes have been discussed in previous sections.


H.     INFORMATION ON COPING

       •      Goal: To provide information about stress reactions and coping to reduce

              distress and promote adaptive functioning.
       While the primary goal of this suggestion is to offer basic coping mechanisms,

The Guide also notes that providing survivors with certain types of information can help

them manage stress and problems more effectively. Many examples of this information
were observed on #bosnow and have been previously discussed. This information

includes current situational awareness, available services, and how authorities are t rying

to help.


I.     LINKAGE WITH COLLABORATIVE SERVICES

       •      Goal: To link survivors with available services needed at the time or in the
              future.

       This suggestion is designed to encourage and personally assist someone to seek
needed assistance. As discussed previousl y, the public nature of Twitter makes it less

useful for personal discussions. Other than offering impersonal recommendations for

services like shelters, this behavior was not noticed with #bosnow tweets.


J.     CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

       Users of the #bosnow hashtag demonstrated many elements of psychological first
aid. While Twitter does not present itself as an ideal platform for all facets of PFA, it

does offer some advantages that make it attractive for offering some portion of the


                                          103
assistance. For one, th e service is free of charge, with the exception of staff time.

Therefore, as long as a public health agency has an effective policy with which to manage

social media use, capital investment is not required to begin using the service.


        Another reason to cont inue to evaluate delivering PFA via Twitter and other
social media is that it may allow agencies to reach citizens in remote areas. Wildfires

often affect broad areas of land in remote areas, which makes it difficult for responders to

provide traditional services. Social media has already demonstrated utility for providing

public health services, such as injury surveillance to remote areas.   281

        As this study demonstrates, users on Twitter, without prompting or involvement

of emergency planners, are already providing many facets of PFA. This tendency should

be explored. Agencies should continue to develop skills in the effective use of social

media to engage with citizens in their jurisdictions. Support and information should be

frequently offered via Twitter after an event.

        Pre-event planning is another area of importance for PFA. Although not part of

this study, PFA also involves providing information to citizens before a disaster on how

people can protect themselves if an event does occur.      282 Many public health and other

emergency response organizations are already using Twitter to provide preparedness
                                               283
information to citizens in their jurisdictions.

        Confidentiality regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and

Accountability Act (HIPAA), probably prohibit the delivery of all PFA services via

Twitter. The public nature of the platform makes it inadvisable for professionals to solicit

personal information from users. However, many facets of PFA are well matched for a
platform such as Twitter. Providing information, including how to access PFA care in

person, can easily be done using social media.

                                              104
       One limitation of this evaluation is that it does not evaluate the effectiveness of

PFA provided by Twitter. It would be useful for future research to examine case studies
examining any potential differences between survivors who used social media

applications like Twitter and those who did not.
