  Abstract

  This article gives a brief overview of the Internet of Things (IoT) for cities, offering examples of IoT-powered 21st
  century smart cities, including the experience of the Spanish city of Barcelona in implementing its own IoT-driven

  services to improve the quality of life of its people through measures that promote an eco-friendly, sustainable
  environment. The potential benefits as well as the challenges associated with IoT for cities are discussed. Much of
  the 'big data' that are continuously generated by IoT sensors, devices, systems and services are geo-tagged or

  geo-located. The importance of having robust, intelligent geospatial analytics systems in place to process and make
  sense of such data in real time cannot therefore be overestimated. The authors argue that IoT-powered smart cities
  stand better chances of becoming healthier cities. The World Health Organization (WHO) Healthy Cities Network
  and associated national networks have hundreds of member cities around the world that could benefit from,

  and harness the power of, IoT to improve the health and well-being of their local populations.
