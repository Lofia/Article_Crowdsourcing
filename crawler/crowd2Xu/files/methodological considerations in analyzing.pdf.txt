Twitter is an online microblogging tool that disseminates more than 400 million messages per day, including vast amounts of

health information.Twitter represents an important data source for the cancer prevention and control community.This paper
introduces investigators in cancer research to the logistics ofTwitter analysis. It explores methodological challenges in extract-
ing and analyzingTwitter data, including characteristics and representativeness of data; data sources, access, and cost; sampling               Downloaded from

approaches; data management and cleaning; standardizing metrics; and analysis.W        ▯ e briefly describe the key issues and provide
examples from the literature and our studies usingTwitter data to understand public health issues. For investigators considering
Twitter-based cancer research, we recommend assessing whether research questions can be answered appropriately usingTwitter,

choosing search terms carefully to optimize precision and recall, using respected vendors that can provide access to the fullTwitter
data stream if possible, standardizing metrics to account for growth in ▯theTwitter population over time, considering crowdsourc-               http://jncimono.oxfordjournals.org/

The full data stream is also provided in raw format by Twitter data

    The fastest and least expensive approach is to conduct manual
searches using keywords through Twitter Search (twitter.com/

Sampling Approaches

Essentially all Twitter studies begin the sampling process by using
search terms and/or hashtags to identify relevant data. Investigators
