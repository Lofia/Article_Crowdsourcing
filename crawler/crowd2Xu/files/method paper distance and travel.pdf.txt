    Abstract

    We describe a method that uses crowdsourced postcode coordinates and Google maps to estimate average distance and
    travel time for inhabitants of a municipality to a casualty clinic in Norway. The new method was compared with methods
    based on population centroids, median distance and town hall location, and we used it to examine how distance affects the
    utilisation of out-of-hours primary care services. At short distances our method showed good correlation with mean travel
    time and distance. The utilisation of out-of-hours services correlated with postcode based distances similar to previous

    research. The results show that our method is a reliable and useful tool for estimating average travel distances and travel
    times.

(kilometres) from Watchtower municipalities to casualty clinic and consultation rate at the casualty clinic (per 1 000 inhabitants per year). Each point
