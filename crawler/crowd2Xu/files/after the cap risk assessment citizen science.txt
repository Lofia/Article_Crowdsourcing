ABSTRACT. I used the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill to examine how crowdsourcing is used as a new form of citizen
sciencethatprovidesrealtimeassessmentsofhealth-relatedexposures.Assessingrisksofanoilspill,ordisastersmoregenerally,
is a challenge complicated by the situated nature of knowledge-generation that results in differential perceptions and responses.
These processes are critical in the case of the British Petroleum spill in the Gulf Coast since the identification of risks promises
to have ramifications for multiple social actors, as well as the health status and long-term resilience of communities in the area.

Qualitative interviews, ethnographic observations, and video data were collected with local social movement organizations,
grassroots groups, spill workers, fisherman, local residents, scientists, and government representatives within five months of
the spill. Findings suggest that crowdsourcing is a new form of citizen science reflecting a transition from lay mapping to an
online data gathering system that allows a broader range of participation and the detection of a broader range of impacts.
Outcomes of this research promise to help demonstrate and theorize how citizen science relates to risk assessment processes

and affects disaster recovery and long-term response.

about the conflation of citizen concerns, risk perception, and
identification of effects. This is further suggested by studies
that show no cytotoxic effects from exposure to oil spills
(Forbes 1994). Yet, studies, such as on the Sea Empress oil

spill, show a significant increase in self-reported headaches,

shown that a range of exposures have been neglected by
experts in past oil spills, including those to communities,

workers, and the environment (Morita et al. 1999, Ha et al.
