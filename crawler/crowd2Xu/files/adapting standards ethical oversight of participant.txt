Category III

   If the proposed research involves no
more than a minimal risk then no

additional formal ethics review is morally
required. A well-grounded finding of

minimal risk, although it exempts a PLR
project from formal review, obviously does

not exempt those engaged in it from
exercising the level of ethical oversight

we properly expect of people in day-to-day
life. This includes considering respect for

autonomy, avoiding unjustified risk of
harm, fair distribution of burdens and

benefits, and due respect for the law.
Figure 2 summarizes the proposal sche-

matically.
   We believe that this scheme merits

further discussion as one way of striking
an appropriate balance between protect-

ing the interests of research participants
and realizing the distinctive benefits of

PLR. In this way, we might prevent ethics
review becoming a strait-jacket on PLR-

liberty, and serving as a disincentive to
