           Abstract: Crowdsourcing is an online, distributed, problem-solving, and production model that
           uses the collective intelligence of networked communities for speciÔ¨Åc purposes. Although its use has

           beneÔ¨Åted many sectors of society, it has yet to be fully realized as a method for improving public
           health. This paper deÔ¨Ånes the core components of crowdsourcing and proposes a framework for
           understanding the potential utility of crowdsourcing in the domain of public health. Four discrete
           crowdsourcing approaches are described (knowledge discovery and management; distributed
           human intelligence tasking; broadcast search; and peer-vetted creative production types) and a

           number of potential applications for crowdsourcing for public health science and practice are
           enumerated.
