     Abstract: Ubiquitous smartphones have created a significant opportunity to form a low-cost
     wireless Citizen Sensor network and producebig data for monitoring structural integrity and
     safety under operational and extreme loads. Such data are particular ly useful for rapid

     assessment of structural damage in a large ur ban setting after a major event such as an
     earthquake. This study explores the utilization of smartphone accelerometers for measuring
     structural vibration, from which structural health and post-event damage can be diagnosed.

     Widely available smartphones are tested under sinusoidal wave excitations with frequencies
     in the range relevant to civil engineering structures. Large-scale seismic shaking table tests,
     observing input ground motion and response of a sctural model, are carried out to evaluate

     the accuracy of smartphone accelerometers unde r operational, white-noise and earthquake
     excitations of different intensity. Finally, th e smartphone accelerometers are tested on a
     dynamically loaded bridge. The extensive expei ents show satisfactory agreements between

     the reference and smartphone sensor measurem ents in both time and frequency domains,
     demonstrating the cpability of the stphone sensors to measure srtuctural responses ranging
     from low-amplitude ambient vibration to higaplitude seismic response. Encouraged by the

     results of this study, the authors are devloping a citizen-engaging and data-analytics
     crowdsourcing platform towards a smartphone-based Citizen Sensor network for structural
     health monitoring and post-event damage assessment applications.

1. Introduction

   With the rapid advances in computer and sensor tec  hnologies in the last two decades, structural health

monitoring (SHM), mostly based on structural vibration, has become animportant research field in civil
engineering [1,2]. Implementation of SHM in civ       il engineering structures, however, has practical

difficulties and financial burdens associated with instrumentation and monitoring. Conventional sensors
have high hardware, installation, and maintenance costs,as well as remote monitoring and cabling issues.
Although wireless sensors aim to solve some of these issues,       additional issues are then introduced

regarding power consumption, data acquisition and networking. These issues have hindered practical
implementation of SHM methodologies on massive scal es such as networks of highway bridges and

urban areas with large stocks of buildings. To address these issues, many emerging sensor technologies
are being developed, including those proposed by the authors’ team (e.g., [3,4]).
   On the other hand, the Internet, smartphones, and       mobile networks have given rise to citizen

participation for crowdsourcing applications and producing valuable data. A number of seismology and
earthquake engineering projects have shown the benefits of such data. In Southern California, citizens

reported experiences to a seismology network after the 1999 7.1-magnitude Hector Mine Earthquake,
taking part in mapping the intensityof the earthquake in a project calledShakeMap [5]. “Did you feel it?”

the online seismic intensity database, received more than 750,000 responses by 2007, and was able to
generate intensity maps in an automated fashion [6,]7. “The Quake Catcher Network” introduced a rapidly
deployable seismic network that aimed to increase the number of seismic stations extensively with

minimal cost based on inexpensive MEMS sensors and volunteers [8–11]. “Community Seismic
Network” is a seismic network which is supporte d by low-cost accelerometers connected to personal

computers or sensors embedded in mobile devices,        and uses data fusion tec hniques to distinguish
earthquake-induced vibrations from false alarms[12–14]. “iShake” is the proposed framework for using
smartphones as seismographs, and studies [15–17] i nvestigated the reliability of ground motion data

obtained from the smartphone sensors. “Commun         ity Seismic Network” and “The Quake Catcher
Network” are utilized to simulate structural response based on the Timoshenko beam theory [18]. These

studies show the potential of using smartphones to measure vibrations.
   Encouraged by the recent development and the ent husiasm of citizens to participate, the authors
propose a smartphone-based Citizen Sensor network to collect structural integrity data at low cost. This

network enables a crowdsourcing platform where        smartphones act as mobile sensors and provide
structural vibration data (pre-processed by the p hones) and GPS location data to a cloud server. The

long-term vibration measurement data and the subseque   ntly identified structuralvibration characteristics
will establish a baseline database for the structure for the purposes of structural health monitoring and

damage detection, as demonstrated in prior research(which is beyond the scope of this paper). Engaging
the crowd will allow efficient monitoring of a large number of structures in an urban setting, which can
Sensors 2015, 15                                                                                    2982


be particularly useful for rapid assessment of stru ctural damage of buildings and urban infrastructure
after a major event such as an earthquake.
   This paper represents the firs t step toward the envisioned Citizen Sensor network by investigating

the feasibility of using smartphone accelerometers to   monitor structural vibration under normal and
extreme loads. A number ofshaking table tests are conducted tocompare smartphone sensor performance

with high-quality accelerometers for measuring vibra tion of different frequencies. Furthermore, input
ground motion and response of a column model, subjected to operational loads, white noise and earthquake
excitations throughout shaking tabeltests, are monitored using smartpone and high-qualiyt accelerometers.

Finally the smartphone sensor was used to measure ambient and forced vibrations of a bridge.
   It is noted that the coupling between the smart    phone and the structure can affect the vibration

measurement [19]. In this study, the smartphones are fixed on the structures using double-sided tapes to
ensure that no local vibration would affect the quality of the structural vibration measurement. In reality,

smartphone users would need to plac  e their phones on rigid holders thatare permanently fixed on building
floors or columns/walls while taking the vibration measurement. The measurement could be automatically
triggered by an event (such asan earthquake) whenthe phones are placedin such holders.


2. Smartphone Sensor Properties

   The most widely used brands       and generations of smartphones, referred to as Smartphone 1,

Smartphone 2 and Smartphone 3, are te sted in this study. They were       carefully selected in order to
consider the factors that might have an influence on the smartphone sensors’ measurement performance.
These factors could be related to hardware such as the accelerometer and processor embedded in the

phone, as well as the material and geometrical pr operties of the phone case. A detailed study on the
effects of such physical properties on smartphone seismometer data quality was conducted by applying

different coupling conditions and can be found in       [15,17]. Software including the measurement
application and the phone’s operating system might also affect the measurement performance.
   Over the last few years, smartphone technology has made significant advances. The phone central

processing unit (CPU) and random-access memory (RAM ) capabilities have increased significantly
while the phone size and weight have decreased [20]. Furthermore, Smartphone 1 and Smartphone 2,

two generations of the same smartphone, are embedded with different microelectro-mechanical systems
(MEMS) accelerometers, the LI S331DLH [21] and LIS331DL [22] , respectively. The accelerometer

properties are listed in Table 1, in comparison with high-quality piezoelectric sensors used in this study
as reference sensors [23]. In addition, anotherwidely available new generatin smartphone, Smartphone 3,
was also tested [24].

   Several available smartphone applications were tested and the “Seismometer” application was chosen
for the vibration measurements in this study. Due to the limitations of the application, the sampling rate

is set to 100 Hz for both smartphone sensors, leading to a Nyquist frequency of 50 Hz.

3. Small-Scale Shaking Table Tests


   Although sensor datasheets provide extensive in formation regarding smartphone accelerometers,
accelerometers’ performance can be influenced by anumber of external effects such as phone hardware,

embedded filters, and phone geomet ry. In other words, bare accel erometer performance might be
different than an accelerometer embedded in a smar        tphone. Therefore, in order to investigate the

smartphone sensors’ ca pabilities of measuring vibration of diffenet frequencies and amplitudes, small-scale
shaking table tests are carrieout. As shown in Figure 1, smartphone sensors are f xied on an electromagnetic

shaking table, togetherwith two of the high-quality piezoelectric rference accelerometers.
























                           Figure 1. Sinusoidal wave shaking table test setup.

   The shaking table is excited with sinusoidal motions of different frequencies including 0.5, 0.8, 1, 2,

5, 10 and 20 Hz. Due to the limitations of the shak ing table, low-frequency content sinusoidal wave
amplitudes are relatively small compared with high-frequency content sinusoidal waves. As a result, the

maximum acceleration amplitudes range from 0.05 g to 0.2 g.
Sensors 2015, 15                                                                                     2984


   Figure 2 illustrates the acceleration time histor   ies measured by the reference and smartphone
accelerometers under sinusoidal excitations of different frequencies. The measured peak amplitudes by
the smartphone sensors agree well with those by the reference sensors, although the smartphone sensors

tend to slightly overestimate the amplitude (which isin correlation with Arias Intensity results presented
in [17]). It is noted that the reference and the smartphone sensor data are acquired by different data

acquisition systems and thus not perfectly synchronized. There are slight differences among the clocks
in the smartphones and in the reference sensor data    acquisition system, result ing in the slight phase
differences in the measured acceleration time histories.























        Figure 2. Time history of reference and smartphone sensors under different frequencies.


   Table 2 summarizes the frequency and the amplitude errors between the reference and the smartphone
sensors. It is observed that the new generation smartphone (Smartphone 2) is significantly more accurate

than the old generation smartphone (Smartphone 1). For instance, for the 1 Hz excitation, the error
between peak horizontal accelerations decreases from 17.5% (Smartphone 1) to 3.10% (Smartphone 2).
Similarly, new smartphone sensors are capable of obtaining the dominant frequency of the signal with

an error up to 0.96% whereas old generation smartphone errors are significantly large, ranging between
4% and 5%. Although accur acy in frequency slightly changes with different tests, the accuracy in

amplitude decreases as peak horizontal acceleration decreases. In conclusion, theerror results in Table 2
show that the new generation smartphone (Smartphone 2)is reasonably accuratefor measuring vibration
in the frequency range relevant to most of the civil engineering structures.

4. Large-Scale Seismic Shaking Table Tests of a Structural Model

   In order to examine the capabilities of smartphone sensors for measuring different types of vibration

at different amplitudes, large-scale seismic shak ing table tests are performed on a masonry column
model, as shown in Figure3, involving operational, white noise and earthquakeexcitation inputs. Further

details about the experiment can be found in [25,26]. The smartphone and reference accelerometers are

installed on the top of the model, while another smartphone is installed on the top of the shaking table
near the foot of the model. The visual inspections before and after the tests show no crack or other types

of damage, and thus the structure isassumed to be a linear time invariant system throughout the tests. In
previous studies, the same assumption is used by th e authors in [27,28], and the crack-damage relationship

can be observed from the shaking table test data asshown in [29,30]. The vibration measurements are used

to identify modal characteristics ofthe structure. In order to determine modal frequencies, power spectral
densities are used. Prior to computation of power      spectral densities, opera tional, white-noise, and

earthquake excitation test time histories are subjected to zero-padding to smoothen the spectral curves.
Therefore, actual spectral resolutions, 0.0100, 0.0 142, and 0.0142 Hz, respectively, are converted into

0.0015 Hz as a result of zero-padding the original time signals.

4.1. Operational Vibration Tests

   First, the seismic shaking table is locked and the responses of th e column model to environmental
vibrations and to hammer impact loading on top are measured. Figure 4 shows the acceleration time

history responses measured at the top of the column by the reference and smartphone sensors under the
hammer impact loading and under the operational vi      brations respectively. Th e plots corresponding

to reference and smartphone sensors are plotted se    parately because that the measurements are not
synchronized, yet the time historiesshow the similarities between the two measurements. Likewise, error
is not quantified as a function of time since samples obtained from reference and smartphone sensors

refer to different time instants. Cross-correlation or GPS synchronization can be addressed to deal with
this problem, which can be addre      ssed in the future. The peak re    sponse to the im pact load is

approximately 0.02 g, while the operational vibration amplitude is less than 0.004 g. It is observed that
smartphone measurements agree well with the reference measurements in terms of amp                 litude

characteristics. Figure 5 shows the power spectral densities of the vibration responses measured by the
reference and smartphone sensors, demonstrating freq  uency characteristics of the measured responses are
significantly close to each other. In other words, Figur5 reflects the spectra of the response to the initial

impact followed by operational vibrations.

4.2. White-Noise Excitation Tests

   The seismic shaking table is excited by white-n oise ground motion input and the smartphone and
reference sensors measure the response of the co   lumn model. Figure 6 co mpares the time history

responses obtained from the reference and smart phone sensors. Figure 7 shows the power spectral
densities of reference and smartphonemeasurements. Significant agreement is observed in both the time

and frequency domains.

4.3. Earthquake Excitation Tests

   Finally, seismic input ground motion and response meas urements are made in order to evaluate the

smartphone performance in measuring seismic strongmotion and structural response. Figure 8 show the
input ground motion time histories trageted by shaking table controller (eference), and the ones measured

by Smartphone 2 and Smartphone 3. The bottom three pl        ots in the figure are the enlarged portions
(between 15 s and 20 s) to show mo re details. It is noted that the shaking table acceleration (the input)

was not measured by the reference sensor. The “Refer      ence” in Figure 8 refers to the input seismic
acceleration generated by the controller of the seismic shaking table. The reference sensor was used for
measuring the structural response in this seismic    excitation experiment. An excellent agreement is

observed between the measurements made by the two different smartphones. A considerable difference
is observed between the target timehistory and the measurements by the smartphone sensors, due to the

fact that a seismic shaking table has physical limita tions of generating targeted motion [31]. Figure 9
shows the acceleration response time histories measured at the top of the model by the reference sensor
and Smartphone 2. Similarly, portions of the top two plots are enlarged in the bottom two plots to show

more details. An excellent agreem ent is observed between the res ponses measured by the smartphone
and the reference sensor.

   Power spectral densities are obtained from the        targeted input, measured input and response
acceleration time histories and plotted in Figure 10, ba sed on which the transfer function is developed
and plotted in the same figure. Again, the spectral densities of the responses measured by the reference

and the smartphone sensors agree well. Although theground motions of two different smartphones have
significant difference with the target input motion app lied to the shaking table, they agree very well in

the frequency domain as well.

4.4. Comparison of Identified Natural Frequencies of the Structural Model

   Natural frequencies of the masonry column model are identified based on the measurements made in

the seismic shaking table tests involving the different types of excitations. The peak picking method is
applied to extract the natural frequencies from the power spectral densities of the response acceleration
under the operational and white-noise excitations shown in Figures 5 and 7. For the seismic excitation,

the natural frequencies are identified from the spectral density function plot in Figure 10. The identified
fundamental frequency values are summarized in Tabe    l 3. From the measurements made by the reference

sensor, the fundamental frequency of tehcolumn model is identified as8 1.2, 17.4, and 17.1 Hz respectively
under the operational, white noise, and earthquake excitations. Th eir counterparts measured by the
smartphone sensor are 18.4,17.2, and 17.5 Hz.The frequency values measured by the smartphone sensor

and the reference sensors are highly comparable, demonts rating the capability of the smartphone sensor in
measuring a structure’s natural frequencies.

   Furthermore, it is observed that the fundamental fr equency of the structural model decreases as its
vibration amplitude increases. This phenomenon has been confirmed by many other studies [32–34] and

further analysis is beyond the scope of this paper.

5. Field Tests of a Bridge


   In order to investigate the perfor mance of smartphone sensors on actual structures, a series of field
tests are conducted on a pre-stressed re inforced concrete pedestrian br idge located in Princeton (NJ,

USA) shown in Figure 11. Smartphone 2 and the reference sensor ar e fixed by double-sided adhesive
tapes in the mid span of the bridge deck to m    easure its ambient vibrati on and response to dynamic

loading. Two sets of dynamic loading tests are carried out. First, a group of participants runs randomly
on the bridge with different speeds, rhythms and      directions to generate dynamic loads of broader

frequency content. Second the same group jumps synchronically at 3 Hz, which isclose to the estimated
natural frequency of the bridge, to excite the first mo de of vibration. Similar to the previous tests, in

ambient vibration, random dynamic, and synchroni zed dynamic test time hist ories, zero-padding is
applied. Therefore, actual spectral resolutions, 0142, 0.0067, and 0.0033 Hz, respectively, are converted

into 0.0015 Hz as a result.














                         Figure 11. Pedestrian bridge in Princeton (NJ, USA).

5.1. Ambient Vibration Test


   Ambient vibration of the bridge, resulting from th e environmental vibration caused by pedestrians
and vehicles passing under the bridge, are measuredusing the smartphone and reference accelerometers

located at the mid span. Figure 12 compares the timheistories obtained from the reference and smartphone
accelerometers. The bottom two plots are enlarged portionsto show more details. First, the amplitude of

the vibration is less than 0.005 g. At this low amplitude, the smartphone sensor is not as sensitive as the
high-quality reference sensor, and as a result some    differences between the two measurements are
observed in the time histories. However, the frequency domain characteristics measured the two sensors

match quite well, as shown in the power spectral density plots in Figure 13. For example, the fundamental
frequency of the brdge identified from te reference sensor meausrement is 3.13 Hz comp  ared with 3.16 Hz

by the smartphone measurement. The error is lessthan 1%. The higher modes by the two measurements
also agree well. Moreover, measurements include smartphone sensors positioned without fixing, which
Sensors 2015, 15                                                                                   2992


also resulted in the same accuracy. In other word s, the smartphone sensors are free to move on the
structure, yet coupled by the friction between the phonesurface and the bridge surface. This implies the
practicality of smartphone sensors for vibration measurement. A deta iled study, considering different

coupling conditions and targeting the effect of fixity on smartphone sensors as seismic instruments is
conducted in [15,17].

5.2. Random Dynamic Test

   In order to apply dynamic loads with broadba      nd frequency content to the bridge, a group of

pedestrians run on the bridge deck randomly with different, varying speeds, rhythms and directions
without any particular pattern. Fi gure 14 shows that the smartphone measurement agrees much better

with the reference sensor measurement than it does in the ambient vibration case (shown in Figure 13).
This is because of the increased vibration amplitude; in fact the random running-induced vibration is ten
times higher than the ambient vibration. From the    power spectral density pl ots in Figure 15, natural
Sensors 2015, 15                                                                                  2993


frequency of bridge is estimated as 3.08 Hz and 3.11 Hz respectively from reference and smartphone
sensor measurements, resulting in an error less than 1%.

5.3. Synchronized Dynamic Test

   Finally, in order to maximize the dynamic load eff ect, the pedestrian participants jump on the mid

span of the bridge deck synchronica lly at a frequency of 3 Hz, which is close to the estimated natural
frequency of the bridge. Figure 16 plots the time histories obtained from the reference and smartphone
accelerometers. Due to the dynamic amplification, the bridge response acceleration exceeds 0.1 g. As the

vibration amplitude increases, the measurement errorof smartphone sensor (with respect to the reference
sensor) becomes insignificant. The power spectral densities based on the smartphone and reference

measurements, as plotted shown inFigure 17, show their excellent agr eement. This synchronized jumping

sensor). Likewise, the error is less than 1%.

5.4. Comparison of Identified Natural Frequencies of the Bridge

   Natural frequencies of the bridgeare identified based on the measuremen  ts made in the field tests. The

peak picking method is app lied to extract the natura l frequencies from the pow er spectral densities of
the response acceleration under the ambient, random and synchronized excitations shown in Figures 13,

15 and 17. Table 4 compares the iden tified fundamental frequency values. From the measurements made
by the reference sensor, the fundamental frequencyof the bridge is identified as 3.13, 3.08, and 3.00 Hz
respectively under the ambient vibration, and the random and synchronized dynamic loading tests, while

their counterparts made by the smartphone sensor are 3.16, 3.11, and 3.03 Hz. Again, frequency values
measured by the smartphone sensor and the referencesensors are highly comparable, demonstrating the

capability of the smartphone sensor in measuring a structure’s natural frequencies. Like the observation
made in the seismic shaking table tests, the fundamentalfrequency of the bridge decreases as its vibration
amplitude increases.

6. Conclusions


   A comprehensive experimental study, involving seismicshaking table tests and bridge field tests, was
carried out to investigate the pe  rformance of smartphone accelerometers in measuring structural

response to dynamic loading ranging from low-ampliu   tde ambient to high-amplitude seismic excitations,
as well as sinusoidal excitations. Three wi        dely-used smartphones embedded with different
accelerometers and a high-quality reference sensor are tested on a small shaking table, a structural model

on a large seismic shaking table, and an actual bridge. All the measurement results are compared in both
time and frequency domains. The followingo   cnclusions can be drawn from this study:

   (1) The small-scale shaking table tests confirm thatthe smartphone sensors are capable of accurately

        measuring sinusoidal vibration of0.5 Hz through 20 Hz, a frequencyrange relevant to most civil
        engineering structures. The measurement error      in terms of the vibration amplitude, when

        compared with the high-quality reference sensor , is less than 5% for      vibration higher than
        1 Hz, but increases as the peak horizontal acceleration decreases. The measurement error in

        terms of vibration frequency is 1% and 5%      respectively for the new and the old generation
        smartphone sensors.
   (2) The large-scale seismic shaking table tests of the structural model and the field dynamic tests of

        the bridge demonstrate the capabilities of smartphone sensors in measuring structural responses
        to a variety of dynamic loads of different amplitudeas well as frequency characteristics. Despite

        the measurement error of the structural response in the time domain under the low-amplitude
        (less than 0.005 g) ambient vibration, it is po   ssible to extract the structures’ fundamental

        frequencies with remarkably small error of less than 1%.
   (3) The two types of the widely-used smartphones with different operating systems and different

        accelerometers show comparable performance. The accelerometer in the newer generation
        smartphone is significantly more accurate than that in the old generation smartphone. The quality

        of the sensors embedded in smatrphones is expected to continue to improvein the future.
   (4) The laboratory and field tests show advantages of the smartphone sensors over the conventional
        sensor, such as the ease of installation and data acquisition as well as wireless transmission.

   It is noted that many issues are yet to be solv    ed such as the on-phone     signal pre-processing,

power-efficient signal transmission and practical phone -structure couplings. Ne vertheless, this study
demonstrates the feasibility of using smartphone accelerometers for measurement of structural vibration

characteristics, from which structuralhealth can be diagnosed as shown in prior research. Encouraged by
the results of this study, the authors are exploring the potential of forming a smartphone-based low-cost
