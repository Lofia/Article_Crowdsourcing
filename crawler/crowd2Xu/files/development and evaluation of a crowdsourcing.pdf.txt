  Clinicians asserted a mean of 879.30 links each weekday

asserting a link each day was 172.61 (125.70 including week-

including weekends). When only counting new links (ie, the ﬁrst
time any clinician linked ‘Metformin 500MG Oral Tablet’ to

‘Type II Diabetes Mellitus’ for any patient), the mean daily
rate was 156.45 new links each weekday (112.97 including
