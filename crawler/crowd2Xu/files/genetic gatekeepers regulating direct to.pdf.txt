     introduction

   In June 2010, a representative of the Government Accountability Office (“GAO”)

appeared before a congressional subcommittee to report the results of GAO’s latest
undercoverinvestigationofdirect-to-consumer(“DTC”)genomictestingservices. The    3

testimonywasscathing.GregoryKutz,directoroftheGAOinvestigation,reportedthat
the DTC services offered “test results that are misleading and of little or no practical

Kutz explained that two services reported that a man who had suffered from irregular

the man’s worn-out pacemaker, Kutz asked, “is [DTC testing] science or is this art?” 6

One subcommittee member—a physician—speculated that DTC test results could

(“FDA”) expressed chagrin: “if there’s any issue here with the FDA, quite frankly, and
I’ll say this, it’s why didn’t we act sooner?”  8

   Unfortunately,boththeinvestigationandthesubcommitteehearingmisconceivedthe

role of DTC genomic services, which are incapable of diagnosing the vast majority of
diseases. Genetic tests yield information that is “probabilistic and not deterministic.”     9

They can identify carrier status for inherited disorders; they can also make qualified

predictions about future disease risks, medication response, and other physical and

metabolic characteristics. But even a perfect genetic test could not predict a complex
health condition with environmental factors—like heart disease—with certainty. Only

through the looking-glass of genetic exceptionalism, which ascribes near-mystical

predictive powers to genetic science, would information of such uncertain value
traumatize its recipient into jumping off buildings.

   Historically, FDAhas regulated few genetic tests. It has not regulated DTC genomic

tests at all. But shortly before the June 2010 hearing, FDA notified certain DTC
companies that their services constituted medical devices within FDA’s statutory

jurisdiction, suggesting that the agency may soon take a larger role. Nearly two years

later, scholars, DTC enthusiasts, and the medical community remain deeply divided on
thebestregulatoryapproach. Some commentators warn of an “incipient culture war”             12

between two factions: bioethicists and clinicians who fear that “health information

is ‘powerful and important and likely to be misinterpreted by people to their own
harm’” unless mediated by expert gatekeepers, and DTC consumers who dismiss  14

those concerns as paternalistic and assert a “right” to access personal genetic data.       15

The best-known DTC genomic service, 23andMe, is thriving despite the long shadow
of regulatory uncertainty; it has expanded its role beyond mere provider of genetic

information, to organizer of crowd-sourced genetic research projects, facilitator of
geneticnetworking,andproducerofpeer-reviewedpublications.Butmanyof23andMe’s

former competitors have quit the DTC market entirely.
   Genetic tests implicate a host of legal, social, ethical, and policy issues, including
data privacy, informed consent, tort liability, genetic discrimination, and health care

resource allocation. However, this Article asks a narrower question: given the current
state of the DTC industry, should FDA become a regulatory gatekeeper, tightly

controllingaccesstoDTCgenomicservices,asitalreadydoesformedicaldevices?The
potentialbenefitsofaunifiedfederalapproachincludequellingregulatoryuncertainty,

harmonizing a patchwork of inconsistent state requirements, and fostering investment
in the genomic innovation sector. But a unified federal approach does not necessarily

requirethatFDAactasgatekeeper.AlthoughFDAhastherequisitestatutoryjurisdiction
and scientific expertise, it is not at all clear that the agency should intervene. FDA

lacks sufficient resources to monitor the constantly evolving scientific and medical
consensus on thousands of genetic variants. Furthermore, its risk-based safety and
                                                               16
effectiveness framework is ill-suited to genomic services, because regulation in this
areapitsintangiblevalueslikeautonomy,identity,andparticipationagainstspeculative

cooperation with other federal agencies.
   Importantly, a regulatory approach that distinguishes FDA’s handling of genomic

services from its handling of medical devices, or other “homebrew” clinical laboratory
tests,neednotentrenchthefallacyofgeneticexceptionalism.Rather,suchanapproach

would acknowledge that medicine is in a crucial transitional phase.Affordable whole-

rich, and participatory. Accordingly, federal agencies—including FDA—have made

substantial commitments to personalized medicine, patient empowerment, and access
to personal medical information. These aspirational principles would be difficult to

reconcile with a regulatory regime in which healthy individuals are kept ignorant of
their own genetic code: “Who has authority to tell an individual what they are allowed
to know about themselves?”     19

and the agency’s historical ambivalence toward genetic tests. Part III concludes that

while FDA likely has the authority to regulate genomic services, there is reason for
caution, particularly with regard to assessing safety and efficacy. Part IV argues that

FDA should adopt a limited role in controlling access to genomic information, but

shouldalsoworkwithotheragenciesandindustrytodevelopstandards,improvepublic

   Genetic tests involve the analysis of DNA, RNA, chromosomes, proteins, or

metabolites in order to detect variations related to health and disease. In recent years,

optimistic rhetoric about the power of “genetic ‘crystal balls’ and genome-based
panaceas” to diagnose, predict, and prevent disease has become nearly ubiquitous.        22

However, such rhetoric reflects deterministic misconceptions about the influence of
genes on future healthand overstates the maturityof the underlying scientificresearch.

Genetic tests, while powerful, are flawed crystals. That fallibility is what makes them

so challenging to regulate.

   Genes, which encode proteins, are the functional units of deoxyribonucleic acid

(“DNA”).   23 A complete set of genes—in humans, approximately 21,000 genes,
                                                  24
on 46 chromosomes—is called a “genome.”             Each chromosome consists of two

in single genes. These classic “Mendelian” disorders include cystic fibrosis, sickle-
cell anemia, and Huntington’s disease. Huntington’s disease is a dominant disorder:

only one copy of the mutated gene is necessary to cause symptoms of the disease. In

contrast, cystic fibrosis, a recessive disorder, will only manifest if two copies of the
mutated gene are inherited.

   Importantly, one’s genetic code (or genotype) cannot necessarily predict one’s
physical state (or phenotype). Huntington’s disease is highly penetrant, meaning that
                                                                                        29

   Although the study of genetics is over a century old, the last few decades have

seen a dramatic, technology-driven increase in knowledge. When the Human Genome
Project launched in 1990, the best-equipped research laboratories could read only one

Genome Project published a draft sequence of the human genome in 2001, its twenty
laboratories“werecollectivelysequencing1,000basepairspersecond,24/7.” Before       31

the Human Genome Project, only 100 disease genes had been identified; today, almost
three thousand Mendelian disease genes are known.       32

   Genetic tests can reliably identify Mendelian disorders like Huntington’s disease,
although such diseases unfortunately remain difficult to treat. But most common

disorders—like heart disease, obesity, addiction, and diabetes—are influenced by a
complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. No single gene determines

whether a person will develop these disorders.As a result, these disorders have proven

harder to study, understand, and predict.

   Clinical genetic tests are typically evaluated using the four dimensions of theACCE
framework: analytical validity, clinical validity, clinical utility, and ethical, social and

legal implications. Analytical validity represents the accuracy and reliability of the
                                                                            43
genotyping or sequencing process in detecting a DNA variation. Clinical validity
represents the test’s predictive value, which depends on the strength of the association

between a genetic marker and a disease. Clinical utility is a complex factor, taking

   As ofApril 2012, genetic tests were available for 2,612 diseases; however, few of

these tests have been evaluated under the ACCE framework. Generally, the analytic
validity of SNP-based tests should be high if the clinical laboratory uses the proper
             47
procedures, although whole-gene sequencing remains the gold standard. However,

SNPgenotyping has certain technical limitations: it cannot detect rare mutations, such
asdeletionsorduplicationsofDNA,andinsomepeople(orethnicpopulations),agiven

SNPmay not be an accurate proxy for a nearby mutation. Clinical validity and clinical

research and the availability of treatments or preventative strategies. Predictive SNP-

based tests that aggregate small contributions to future disease risk require different
approaches to evaluating clinical validity and clinical utility than diagnostic tests for
                                        49
high-penetrance genetic disorders. Since genetic diagnostics are rarely evaluated in

In general, tests for genetic variations with weak predictive power are unlikely to have

demonstrable clinical validity and/or utility at this time.

B. Personalized Health Care


   “Personalized health care” is often described as the effort to “shap[e] preventive
and diagnostic care to match each person’s unique genetic characteristics.” Federal    51

efforts like the Secretary of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) Personalized
                                                     52
Health Care Initiative and FDA’s Critical Path have invested significant resources in
“information-based health care” built on basic genetic research, clinical applications,
                                                                                   53
health information management, and decision-supporting technologies, in order to

promote patient empowerment:

       An important ideal of personalized health care is to better enable patients

       themselvestobeparticipantsandguidesintheirownhealthcare...[p]atients

       willincreasinglypossessboththeinformationandthesenseofauthoritythat
       will help them become partners in their own care, helped by professionals

       who are increasingly seen as advisors and “coaches.”         54

of how genetic differences affect an individual’s response to drugs. Pharmacogenetic
tests are expected to transform clinical practice by informing medication selection
                                                                                                56
and dosage, reducing the risk of over- or under-treatment, and avoiding toxicity.
Pharmacogenetic targets include genes like CYP2D6, which encodes an enzyme

that metabolizes approximately one-fourth of currently used drugs, including many
                                                        57

recommendations for CYP2D6 genotyping, in their products’labeling.
   Pharmacogenomics also has the potential to target new drugs to certain patient

populations, and thereby facilitate FDAapproval. In even the most carefully designed
                                                                       61
clinical trials, subjects display a range of treatment responses. Where this variability
correlates with known genetic markers, manufacturers have developed “companion

diagnostics” to identify those patients most likely to respond favorably. Some of the

more complex diagnostic tools intended to guide clinician decisionmaking arguably
blur the line between product and medical practice; Genomic Health’s Oncotype DX,

forexample,“helpspatientsandtheirdoctorsmakeinformed,individualizedtreatment

decisions” about chemotherapy by reporting a “Recurrence Score,” using a complex
algorithm based on the relative activity of multiple cancer genes.        64

   The ultimate goal of genomic medicine is to anticipate and prevent future health
             65
conditions. However, skeptics point out that genetic variation currently accounts for
only five to fifty percent of the genetic risk of a given disease. Environmental factors,

family history, and behaviors like smoking are better indicators of disease risk than

most genetic variants, prompting pessimism about the benefits of predictive genetic
testing. For example, one study found that screening eighteen SNPs linked to Type

2 diabetes gave a risk estimate “essentially no better” than one based on the patient’s
                                    68
body mass index, age, and sex. And in a study of statin drug response, the best two
SNPs had weaker predictive value than age and gender.          69

   Predictive genetic tests are also difficult to integrate into medical practice, because
                                                            70

   Whole-genome sequencing will likely supersede gene chip tests in the next few
years. From the Human Genome Project’s estimated $3 billion price tag, the cost of74

whole genome sequencing has fallen to about five thousand dollars, and is expected
to dip below the thousand-dollar mark soon. Affordable whole-genome sequencing

will enable individuals to obtain their genomic sequence once, file the data away, and

relatedinformation“forresearch,informational,andeducationaluseonly.” 23andMe
and its competitors report variants in metabolic genes involved in drug sensitivity,

carrier status for inherited diseases, gene variants linked to ancestry, and relative risk

for several dozen diseases. These services also provide additional explanatory material
and links to primary literature. They are within the reach of many, though certainly

not all, consumers: as of May, 2012, 23andMe’s service was priced at $399, while its
                                                         84
competitor deCODE Genetics’ service was $1,100. Approximately thirty-five other
DTC services offer ancestry information without health information, typically for a

fewhundreddollars. Several services offer social networking tools or “relative finder”
              87
applications; some offer additional tests for traits like hair color, baldness, or earwax
stickiness. Finally,someDTCservicesfocusonpersonalizeddiet(or“nutrigenomic”)

information, or test for specific diseases, likeAlzheimer’s.      90

   A few years ago, many more DTC services jostled for a share of the market. In
2009, the Genetics and Public Policy Center identified forty DTC providers just for

health-related conditions, including nine “personal genome services.” Over the last

few years, under the scrutiny of state and federal regulators, many companies “left the
market in silence” or switched to a prescriber-mediated model. Today, about twenty

DTC providers offer health-related information, including 23andMe and deCODE

D. Participatory Genomics

   Participatory research is yet another manifestation of “open science,”        110 the open

source software movement, “citizen science,” and crowdsourcing. It is most apparent
inonlinepatientcommunitiessuchasPatientsLikeMe,wheremembersself-organizeto

conduct “personalized research” and exchange actionable medical information.            111For

example,a group of amyotrophic lateralsclerosis (ALS) patientsconductedan “ad hoc
clinicaltrial”oflithiuminspiredbyanunpublishedItalianclinicalstudy:theyobtained

prescriptions from their physicians, tracked their vital data using PatientsLikeMe’s
online tools, and shared their results.  112Such self-guided experimentation elicits fears

that PatientsLikeMe “tacitly encourages” risky choices by nonexpert patients, such as
using drugs off-label or changing dosages.     113

   Other participatory research initiatives emphasize altruism and scientific

advancement. Harvard’s Personal Genome Project (“PGP”) plans to sequence the
genomes of 100,000 volunteers and contribute their genomic and medical record
                                            114
informationtoanew“publicgenomics.” PGP cites “advanc[ing] medicine and global
health,”“contribut[ing]directlytoascientificendeavor,”andpursuingautonomy-related
                                                                 115
values like “self-curiosity” as motivations for participation.      Sage Bionetworks seeks
“common genomic research” volunteers willing to “share [genetic and health] data in

order to benefit the common good.”     116Genomera, a startup “platform for group health

science” with the motto “heal the world,” promises to “enable[e] participants to design
and operate open health studies” and plans “crowd-sourced clinical trials”         117with its

ethos into its corporate identity. 23andMe effectively rebranded itself in 2008              by
creatingaresearcharm,23andWe, which “make[s] meaningful scientific contributions
                                                                             122
by enabling its customers to participate directly in genetic research.”         The 23andWe
research model is more “top-down” and less “democratic” than Genomera’s,                123 and

23andMe has been criticized for failing to make its data publicly available to outside

researchers. But by enabling its customers to download and reshare their own raw
SNPdata, 23andMe indirectly facilitates a variety of third-party research initiatives.       124

   Studies suggest the participatory research consumer-volunteer differs from the
traditional patient or the traditional clinical research subject. Richard Tutton and

Barbara Prainsack describe 23andMe as targeting those “enterprising” consumers

“willing to pay for information about personal genetic risks while, at the same time .
. . actively contribute towards new research;” they see this as a significant departure

from the traditional view of research subjects as “need[ing] protecting from personal
genetic risk information which could have adverse consequences for them.”            125 Media

accounts indicate that Tutton and Prainsack have aptly captured the mindset of many
23andMe early adopters, so-called “health hackers” in pursuit of scientific knowledge

and self-improvement.     126In a more critical vein, Kaushik Sunder Rajan argues that

theAmerican biotechnology industry “configures subjects as sovereign consumers”—
“valoriz[ing] individuals as agential, biosocial patient-consumers,” yet devaluing their
                                     127
non-expertperceptionsofhealth.          SunderRajanrecognizesthatsovereignconsumers
have the liberty to “choose rationally among available options”—a liberty “inherent

to the very rationale of personalized medicine as a practice that is, in the first instance,

preventative”—buthequestionstheextenttowhichconsumersareactuallyempowered

research.     To give truly informed consent, participants in open genomic studies must
have a working knowledge of basic genetics, understand that risks and benefits cannot
                                                                                135
be anticipated, and recognize that their privacy cannot be guaranteed.             PGP requires
that volunteers pass an entrance exam demonstrating their understanding of these

risks.136 “Genetic-information altruists” will likely participate despite the risks,       137and

a “portable consent” permitting their data to be shared across multiple platforms has
already been drafted.   138But researchers are still unsure how to structure studies, obtain

institutional review, and comply with statutory and regulatory requirements (if those
                              139
requirements even apply).
   Another area of uncertainty is participant access to study data.         140 Human subjects

research guidelines recommend withholding information without clinical utility from
study subjects.  141 But withholding participants’ data is incompatible with the open

genome philosophy espoused by PGP,            142 or the “enterprising self” model used by

E. Concerns About DTC Genome Services


   All genetic tests implicate ethical, legal, and social issues, including concerns about
disclosure, misuse, and the impact of adverse news on a patient’s wellbeing. However,

DTC genome services prompt especially vociferous objections, summarized briefly
below.

   1. Misleading DTC ServiceAdvertising. Many critics predict that consumers misled
by inaccurate, incomplete, or unclear advertising will misunderstand the service they

are buying. Consumers may expect a service to be more comprehensive than it is;
for example, they may not realize that 23andMe tests only three SNPs out of dozens

associated with breast cancer.    147 And misplaced beliefs in genetic determinism—the

ideathatone’sgenesdictateone’sidentity,totheexclusionofotherfactors—mayfoster
unrealistic expectations about the utility of test results.

   Non-European consumers, in particular, may fail to appreciate the limited relevance
some tests have for members of their ethnic groups.           148Becauseninety-sixpercent
                                                               149

                            151
to mitigate this disparity,    and 23andMe has offered free testing toAfrican-American
consumerstodiversifytheirdatabase.         152Butinthemeantime,genomictestresultsmay

be less accurate or relevant to non-European consumers, and this limitation is unlikely

to be apparent to potential consumers.

(J. Schildmann et al., eds., 2012). The debate about disclosing genetic data with uncertain utility parallels

the debate about FDA regulation of DTC genome services. Both debates start from the presumption that

   2. Lack of Expert Gatekeepers. Some critics contend that DTC genomic services,
particularly internet-mediated services, “undermine[] the health professional’s role as
                                                                 153
gatekeeper and mediator of complex health technologies,”            and that medical experts
shouldhaveamandatorypre-testgatekeepingrole. Ideally,medicalexpertswouldstep

intocorrectmisunderstandings,raiseanyconcernstheconsumermayhaveoverlooked,

and discourage testing that would not be in the consumer’s best interest. However,
many physicians have little genetic training, and may lack the very “basic gatekeeping
                                          155
abilities”theyareexpectedtoprovide. Ifso,“designating[non-geneticistphysicians]
as gatekeepers” could be tantamount to “sticking healthcare in a time capsule for a
                                                       156
decade or more, until physicians get up to speed.”

   3. Burdening Health Care Systems. Some critics argue that gene chip tests, while
efficient at generating information, will ultimately waste scarce medical resources

through“amedicaltesting‘cascadeeffect’withunwarranteddiagnostic,pharmacologic,
and surgical interventions.”   157Demands on clinicians’time are expected to increase as

tests become more comprehensive: according to one estimate, it would take a genetic

clinician five hours to explain the variants of interest in a typical patient’s whole-
genome sequence.     158Apparently healthy patients demanding unwarranted follow-up

testingwouldfurtherburdenhealthcareproviders,andcouldplacepatientsthemselves
in unnecessary risk.  159

   4.InaccurateResults.Althoughoccasionalhigh-profilemistakeshavesparkedfears
               160
ofinaccuracy,     a 2009 study by DNA sequencing pioneer J. Craig Venter indicates that
DTCcompanies’rawdataarequiteaccurate.            161Thesamemaynotbetrue,however,for
                                   162
their estimated risk predictions.     GAO’s 2010 testimony criticized four DTC services
forreportingdiscordantriskpredictionsbasedonthesameDNAsamples—e.g.,reporting
                                                       163
“high risk” versus “low risk” for the same disease.       GAO deemed the “contradictory”

tests useless and misleading. Id. However, such discrepancies are explained by
methodological differences (such as using different SNP markers and population risk
           164
estimates)    and the relative immaturity of genetic testing technology. DTC providers are

of their predictions,    and in 2010, 23andMe requested assistance from FDAand NIH
in developing standards and best practices for risk reporting.      166

   5. Misleading Results. Because predictive testing involves complex science and
statistics, many critics fear consumers will misunderstand their results.       167 These fears

appear well-founded, given that public health literacy is unfortunately low, and even
educatedconsumershavetroubleunderstandingrelativeriskdata. A2010studyfound8

that most US adults would have trouble reading and using genomic service websites.            169

   6. Collateral Results. Because personal genomic services report risk estimates for
hundredsofhealthconditions,consumersmaybeexposedtounanticipatedorunwanted
                                                       170
risk information—the so-called “incidentalome.”           23andMe mitigates this concern by
“locking”certainresults,suchasbreastcancer,soconsumersmustaffirmativelyopt-in

toseetheinformation.However,fewstudiesappeartohavegathereddataontheeffects

ofexposuretounwantedgeneticinformation,muchlesssoughttoquantifythoseeffects.
   7. Consumer Distress. Many critics warn that the psychological impacts of adverse

genetic information can be “extreme,” particularly without genetic counseling, and
that some consumers will react to “potentially traumatizing genetic test results”       171 with
                                        172
distress,fear,anxiety,ordepression.        Thisfearseemsplausiblewithrespecttoserious
conditions like breast cancer or Alzheimer’s. However, recent studies have found no

evidence to support consumer distress resulting from DTC testing.          173

   8. Harmful Consumer Action. Coupled with fear of consumer distress is another
fear: that consumers will make poor choices, with harmful consequences. These fears

were heightened by a 2006 GAO report concluding that DTC nutrigenomic companies
deceived consumers into buying overpriced nutritional supplements.             174Critics argue

that a “false sense of security” based on predictions of lowered risk could lead to poor

predictions of heightened risk could trigger medication switches               or unwarranted
prophylactic surgery.   178 However, these speculative fears are countered by evidence

suggesting that predictive genetic testing motivates individuals to engage in healthy
behavior  179and plan for the future.  180

   9. Lack of Genetic Counseling. The American College of Medical Genetics and
Genomicsrecommendsbothpre-andpost-testcounselingforasymptomaticindividuals

undergoinggeneticscreening.       181Genetic counseling could compensate, at least to some
                                                                                               182

testing;   somethingsimilarcouldbeimplementedforgenomictesting,thoughitwould
almost certainly increase the cost to consumers.

   10. Unanticipated Harms. Finally, the evolving DTC industry elicits relatively
novel concerns, ranging from potential exploitation of consumers’ genetic data by

insurance companies and other entities, to ownership of participatory research results
andinnovations,tothesecurityofpersonaldatashouldaDTCcompanyfail. Privacy-            184

related concerns include fears that individuals could be tested without their knowledge

or consent, that family members may be exposed to information unwillingly, and that
parents may test minor children, rather than letting their children make such choices

for themselves.

F. Heightened Scrutiny of DTC Genomic Services

   Aware of the concerns outlined above, federal agencies and advisory committees

have closely monitored the genetic testing industry for over a decade. The Secretary
of HHS convened two influential advisory committees to recommend improvements
                                   185
to regulation of genetic testing.     As DTC tests entered the market in 2006, FDA, FTC
and CDC released a joint consumer alert recommending skepticism, and noting that

FDA did not approve DTC testing services. Also in 2006, GAO’s investigation of the
DTC nutrigenomic service industry concluded that “the tests . . . mislead consumers

by making predictions that are medically unproven and so ambiguous that they do not
provide meaningful information.”      186In 2008, NewYork and California sent cease-and-
                                                                    187

held a hearing that included a panel on DTC genomic services.
   Also in July of 2010, GAO reported the results of its second DTC investigation to

Congress, describing DTC services as “misleading and of little or no practical use”
and “egregious examples of deceptive marketing.”        193GAO investigators reached these

conclusions after four services, later identified as 23andMe, Navigenics, Pathway

Genomics and DeCODE Genetics, reported inconsistent disease risk estimates for the
same genetic samples.    194Although the GAO report, like its 2006 predecessor, reflected

   On the other hand, because FDA has historically exercised enforcement discretion

over tests conducted in clinical laboratories (so-called “lab-developed tests” or
“homebrews”), the vast majority of genetic tests have never been FDA-approved.

Regulating those tests will strain the agency’s resources, and could overlap with the
CLIA regime administered by CMS. FDA’s regulatory framework for medical device

                                                206
the structure or any function of the body.”        The 1938 Act authorized FDA to take
action against adulterated or misbranded medical devices, most importantly under

section 502, “which declares a drug or device to be misbranded ‘[i]f its labeling is
                                          207
false or misleading in any particular.’”     However, medical devices were not regulated
as tightly as drugs, and device manufacturers were not required to obtain premarket
                                     208
clearance or approval from FDA.

Bacto-Unidisk.      After Bacto-Unidisk, FDAtook the position that it could regulate all
diagnostic products as drugs, although it refrained from doing so.      210But the agency’s

authority over diagnostic products was not completely clear. Just a few years after
Bacto-Unidisk, United States v. Article of Drug (Ova II) held that a pregnancy test was
                                          211
nota“drug”withinFDA’sjurisdiction.           TheOvaII court distinguisheB      dacto-Unidisk

on the grounds that while a test for diagnosing a bacterial infection might be a “drug”
under the FD&C Act, a pregnancy test “is not a test for the diagnosis of disease. It is

no more than a test for news, which may be either good news or bad news depending
on whether pregnancy is wanted or not.”      212

   Congress responded by expanding and clarifying FDA’s statutory authority over
                               213
the medical device category.      The new, expansive definition of “device” in the 1976
Amendments to the FD&CAct includes, inter alia, any


      instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro

        394 U.S. 784 (1969). The Bacto-Unidisk product was a paper disc impregnated with antibiotics,
which was exposed to a patient sample. The disc helped clinicians identify the best antibiotic to administer
to the patient. The Supreme Court accepted the agency’s determination that the disc was a drug, reasoning

that “the word ‘drug’is a term of art for purposes of theAct, encompassing far more than the strict
medical definition of that word,” and that the FDCA “is to be given a liberal construction consistent with
theAct’s overriding purpose to protect the public health.”

that FDA’s medical device authority should be broad enough to reach products like the
                             217
diagnostic test in Ova II.
   Drugs and medical devices cannot be legally marketed until FDA is satisfied that

they are “safe and effective.” Though FDA may not always intervene, the agency’s
absolute premarket approval authority carries with it the “concomitant authority to
                                                                                          218
prohibit distribution of any unapproved product—even for dying patients.”                    FDA
cemented this authority in the late 1970s, when it cracked down on Laetrile, a popular

butunapprovedalternativecancertreatment.           219Cancerpatientsandtheirfamiliessued,

arguing that terminally ill patients and their physicians should have the choice to use
thedrug.  220ButtheSupremeCourt,approvingtheagency’scautiousapproachtosafety
                                                                                 221
and efficacy, unanimously upheld the FDA’s authority to ban Laetrile.
   Today, FDA regulates a wide range of products as medical devices, from wheelchairs

to “mobile medical apps.”       222A product’s “intended use” is critical to determining

whether FDA considers it a medical device under FD&C Act § 201(h). For example,
while general-purpose calculator software is not a medical device, FDA will regulate
                                                                                          223
softwareintendedtocalculatedrugdosesbasedonapatient’sheightandweight. FDA
considers the manufacturer’s objective intent, as demonstrated by a device’s labeling,
                                                                                     224
advertising, statements, and other factors, to be evidence of intended use.
   Adevice’s intended use also determines the scope of premarket review.All medical

devices are subject to a three-tier, risk-based system of regulatory oversight. Devices

are classified according to “the level of [regulatory] control necessary to assure the
safety and effectiveness of the device,” when used as intended, taking into account the
                                         225
potential risks to the patient or user.     Class I includes devices that pose the lowest risk
to the patient or user, such as latex exam gloves.        226Mercury thermometers,       227 blood

determinations . . . including the critical issue of identifying ‘probable risks’ and

   FDAhas approved relatively few genetic IVDs, most of which are Class II or III.

C. Laboratory-Developed Tests (LDTs)


   FDA has long refrained from regulating a category of tests offered by clinical
laboratories, called laboratory-developed tests (“LDTs”) or “home brew” tests.                    268
                                                                                       269
LDTs are developed, validated, and offered within a single laboratory.                    Because
LDTs are not cleared or approved by FDA, developing a diagnostic test as an LDT
                                                                   270
allowsmanufacturers“toavoidstringentFDAoversight.”                    However,LDTscannotbe
distributed to other laboratories, hospitals or clinics.     271 LDTs were originally used for

rareconditions,buttheLDTmarkethas“exploded”inrecentyears. Although FDA has  272

approved a handful of genetic test kits, the vast majority of genetic tests, including the
BRCAbreast cancer gene tests,        273are LDTs that FDAhas never cleared or approved.           274

   Sinceatleasttheearly1990s,FDAhasassertedthatLDTsaremedicaldeviceswithin
its jurisdiction, but that it would nonetheless exercise “enforcement discretion.”             275In

1992,FDAplannedtoimposepremarketrequirementsonLDTs,butfacedwithindustry
resistance,insteadoptedtoregulatethe“activeingredients”inLDTs.                  276These“analyte

specific reagents” (“ASRs”) may be subject to premarket notification or approval
                                                        277
requirements, depending on their intended use.             Among other things, the ASR rule
was meant to ensure that LDTs used quality ingredients, and to clarify that LDTs are
                                                   278
not themselves FDA-approved or cleared.                FDA has explained that it determined
regulation of LDTs was not necessary “due to [FDA’s] confidence in high-complexity
                                        279
laboratories’ability to useASRs.”

                                                     283
FDAhas apparently abandoned that approach.
   InJune2010,FDAannouncedthatitwouldexerciserisk-basedregulatoryoversight

those “marketed directly to consumers,” were becoming more complex and “playing

an increasingly important role in clinical decision-making and disease management,
particularly in the context of personalized medicine.”        285FDA subsequently requested

public comments and held a stakeholder meeting.          286 However, almost two years later,

FDAhas not yet released further guidance.
   It is unclear whether FDA has the resources to implement premarket clearance and
                                                                   287
approval for thousands of LDTs, even if it wished to do so.           Presumably, FDAwould
focusitsattentiononhigh-riskLDTsandcontinueexercisingenforcementdiscretionfor

more routine tests. Even under the current system, LDTs are not entirely unregulated;
some LDTcomponents, such asASRs, must be FDA-approved, and FDAoccasionally
                                                                                 288
takes enforcement action against tests that fail to qualify as LDTs.                 In addition,
laboratories that conduct LDTs are subject to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement

Amendments of 1988 (“CLIA”), overseen by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (“CMS”).     289

   DTC genomic services, which include genotyping by a CLIA-certified laboratory,
are often assumed to be LDTs. However, FDAdoes not seem to see it that way. FDA’s

2010 untitled letters to several DTC genome service providers stated that “FDA does
not consider your device to be [an LDT] because [it] is not developed by and used in

a single laboratory.”  290 This distinction seems to emphasize the two-step process used

moderate- and high-complexity testing must be certified; CLIA-certified labs are

inspectedforpersonnelrequirements,qualitycontrolandassurance,proficiencytesting,

nonprofit accrediting organizations using CLIAstandards; New York and Washington
State operate their own CLIA-exempt programs.        312

   Under CLIA, laboratories that develop LDTs must establish “performance

reporting, reference intervals, and “any other performance characteristic required for
                    313

will use; rather, the laboratories themselves are responsible for “ensur[ing] that their

test results are accurate, reliable, timely, and confidential and do not present the risk of
harm to patients.”  314CMS regulations require CLIA laboratories to obtain a “written

or electronic request for patient testing from an authorized person,” but the regulation
                                                                  315

(“DOE”) convened a joint Task Force on Genetic Testing, which recommended

“the creation of a specialty of genetics that would encompass all predictive genetic
                                                                                             318
tests” to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Advisory Committee (“CLIAC”).
CLIAC endorsed the proposed genetic test specialty, as did CDC and the Secretary’s
                                                           319
AdvisoryCommitteeonGeneticTesting(“SACGT”).                   However, the proposal was not
implemented by CMS.       320CMS currently does not distinguish laboratories performing
                                                                            321
genetic tests from those performing other tests of similar complexity.         Nor does CMS
impose special requirements on laboratories providing DTC testing.          322

   In2007,SACGT’ssuccessor,SACGHS,wastaskedwithinvestigating“theoversight
                                                           323
oflaboratorytestingthroughthelensofgenetictests.” SACGHS found that “the most
rigorous form of performance assessment” under CLIA, proficiency testing, was not

required for all labs offering genetic testing, and that “the resources, funding, and means
to develop formal [proficiency testing] for all genetic tests are lacking.”      324 SACGHS

suggested clarifying CLIA’s jurisdiction over health-related tests and DTC tests,            325
                                                                               326
rectifying gaps in oversight, and providing more enforcement tools,                particularly
since denying Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement would have little deterrent effect
                                   327
on labs providing DTC testing.        Ultimately, however, SACGHS did not recommend
the creation of a special CLIA framework for regulating genetic testing,         328explaining

that “the concerns associated with genetic testing generally do not differ from other
complex laboratory tests,” and “it will be increasingly difficult to distinguish between

genetic and other complex laboratory tests” in the future.      329

Under a 1971 liason agreement, FTC has primary responsibility for medical device

have been at odds in the past, more recent FTC activities reflect a “guiding principle

of harmonizing the FTC’s policies with those of FDA,” for example, by requiring
advertising to be consistent with PMArequirements.         332

   FTC requires that “advertisers must possess and rely upon a reasonable basis for
all objective claims - express and implied - that reasonable consumers take from

and in enforcement actions, “[t]he burden is on the Commission to prove that [the

substantiated, FTC has adopted the Pfizer six-factor test, which considers, inter alia,

the consequences of a false claim (such as potential harms to consumers), benefits
of a truthful claim, and the amount of substantiation experts in the field believe is
             335
reasonable.     For health claims, “competent and relsic          aelnetificevidence”isgenerally
required.  336FTC often looks to FDA labeling requirements to clarify the scope of

permissible claims for a medical product.       337

   In 2006, FTC, FDA and the Centers for Disease Control (“CDC”) jointly issued a
consumer alert warning about DTC tests.          338FTC followed up in 2008 with a second
      339
alert.   SACGHS has recommended that FTC collaborate with FDA, CMS and CDC to
“strengthenmonitoringandenforcementeffortsagainstlaboratoriesandcompaniesthat

make false and misleading claims about laboratory tests, including direct-to-consumer

A. Familiar Territory: the Libertarian Critique

   Rhetoricabout“FDA’sgeneticpaternalism”         maybeoverblown,butitisnotcompletely
unfair.360Critics of DTC genomic services often invoke “nightmare” hypotheticals about

ignorant, panicked consumers harming themselves.          361 By asserting jurisdiction over
DTC genomic services, FDAmay appear to have given credence to these fears.At the

same time, regulators are questioning whether, given the state of the science, genomic
services have any cognizable value at all.    362

   The situation is what Timothy Caulfield calls a “policy paradox”: “If, as many in

future health as we were once led to believe, and if access does not, for most, cause
harm, why regulate the area?”     363If genomic tests have little predictive value, they are

at best entertainment and at worst snake oil, to be restricted mainly so consumers are
not misled by scientific razzle-dazzle into buying worthless things. But at the same

time, critics insist that qualified gatekeepers must watch over consumers, in case the
same worthless tests reveal frightening information about consumers’ risk of serious,

life-changing diseases. And because DTC genomic services test thousands of SNPs,
associated with many potential health conditions, both critiques have a grain of truth

to them.
   Autonomy-based arguments are often invoked in opposition to government

restrictions on genomic testing. For example, one could argue that individuals have a
fundamentalrighttoobtaintheirowngeneticorhealthinformationwithoutgovernment

interference.Thereislimitedfederalrecognitionofsucharight:entitiescoveredbythe
Health Insurance Portability and AccountabilityAct (“HIPAA”) must disclose patient
                                  364
records,withsomelimitations;         although some ethicists and clinicians feared HIPAA-
mandated disclosure could distress or confuse patients, such concerns have not been
               365
substantiated.    In a similar vein, a proposed CMS rule would “increase direct patient
access rights” by requiring CLIA-regulated labs to give patients their test results.         366

However, HIPAA and the proposed CMS rule only require disclosure of pre-existing
health information; they do not confer an affirmative right to be tested. To support an

affirmative right, one might make a stronger patient autonomy argument, asserting the
rightto“possessboththeinformationandthesenseofauthority”requiredtocontrolone’s
ownmedicalcare,     367and to participate in developing that information through research.

   For FDA, these libertarian arguments are familiar territory. From its beginnings,
the agency fought popular belief in a “right of self-medication” rooted in consumer

“insufficiently informed” patients who were “prone to disregard directions.”          369 Daniel

Carpenter has described FDA’s crackdown on the unapproved cancer drug Laetrile
as the ultimate collision of the libertarian right to self-medication with FDA’s expert
            370
regulation.     On the one side, cancer patients and their supporters “linked a populist
ethosofself-medicationtoissuesofjusticeandtomoreprogressivenormsofacademic
                                                                                      371
and intellectual freedom, the liberty of research and exploration of ideas.”             On the
other side, FDA arrayed its “gatekeeping power and, even more, its power to define
                                                                            372
and assess the validity and scientific rigor of therapeutic research.”
   FDA consistently opposed Laetrile, despite the drug’s widespread use by as many

as seventy-five thousand patients, and (until 1978) a dearth of evidence that it was
toxic.373 State legislatures, activist groups, and newspaper editorials called on FDA to

   FDA’s regulation of HIV tests in the 1980s offers another historical analogy to
                                                                                376
genomic service regulation, which is in some ways an even better fit.              At the time,
FDA’s decision to prohibit home HIV tests was supported by AIDS advocates, who

fearedthatifconsumerslearnedtheywereHIV-positivewithoutclinicalsupport,itwould
trigger “widespread suicides, panic and a rush to public health clinics.”          377Although

advocatesofhometestingdismissedtheseargumentsas“paternalisticclaptrap,” FDA              378
delayed approving home HIV tests for almost a decade. When the first home test was

agency’s fears of adverse reactions were not realized.
   Contemporary debates about the DTC genomic testing, with their dire warnings of

irrational consumers jumping off buildings, are reminiscent of the HIV home testing
debates. 380Perhaps this is because HIV status and genetic information have both been

   Whether FDA seems paternalistic or precautionary in closing each of these gates

likely depends on whether one thinks consumers are justified in disregarding expert
                    386
risk assessments.      According to Dennis Thompson, FDA did not claim “unqualified
paternalistic authority” to ban Laetrile, but rather “sought to show the decision to use

Laetrile is usually impaired” by the cancer patient’s desperation, disease, and distrust
ofmedicalauthority.    387Governmentregulatorscannotavoidpaternalismentirely;even

   Courts will likely defer to FDA’s determination that health-related DTC genomic
servicesaremedicaldevicesundertheFD&CAct.DTCgenomicservicesarepredictive,

in that they offer estimates of disease risk, and the plain language of section 201(h)
(2) covers products for use in disease “prediction.”     390 While DTC providers deny their

services are diagnostic, the services could reasonably be characterized as diagnostics
                                                                          391

courtshaveconstruedtheFD&CAct’sdefinitionof“device”expansively,                      and FDA’s
expertise has earned the agency the judicial deference necessary to “regulate products

that fell into the interstices between statutory categories” and make “novel and broad
interpretations of its jurisdiction.” 394

   FDA has disavowed jurisdiction over DTC services that provide only non-health
relatedinformation,suchasancestryservices, which are not within the plain language

of section 201(h)(2). However, there are at least two arguments FDA might make to
support jurisdiction over these services as well. First, some ancestry information can

predicthealthoutcomes.Certainpopulationshavehigherrisksofdevelopingorpassing
on diseases; for example, Tay-Sachs disproportionately afflicts Ashkenazi Jewish

individuals.Drugresponsealsovariesbetweenpopulations:African-Americansrespond
less well, on average, to beta-blockers.    396Thus, clinicians often use self-reported race

in drawing inferences about patients’ risks.      397However, racial identity is a complex
                                                                                     398
social concept that does not necessarily correlate with geographic ancestry.             Not all
health disparities between racial groups have a genetic basis, but for conditions with a

significant genetic component, markers of ancestry may be better risk indicators than
traditional self-reported racial categories.   399

   Second, the genotype data generated by DTC ancestry services are functionally
identicaltothedatageneratedbyDTChealthservices.Thesamegeneticsequence,orset
                                                                     400

returnedtoaconsumerbyanancestryservicecouldbeusedtoestimatediseaserisk(or
             401
viceversa).     FDAthereforearguethateffectivegatekeepingofhealthriskinformation
would be circumvented, if non-health services were permitted to operate without

oversight—an argument somewhat analogous to justification for prohibitions on off-
label promotion of FDA-approved drugs. However, the pharmaceutical manufacturers

subject to off-label restrictions are clearly subject to FDA’s jurisdiction, because they

         It is unclear how many of the DTC ancestry companies permit consumers to download raw SNP
data, but interestingly, only one quarter of them expressly limit the “intended use” of their services to
“recreational, educational, or entertainment purposes.” Wagner et al., supra note 85.
2012                                                                                        511



must secure premarket approval to market their drugs at all. Imposing FDA authority
on an ancestry service that does not sell any FDA-regulated drugs or medical devices

might be harder to justify.
   Whether or not DTC genome services fall under the LDT umbrella,                  402theyare

administered by CLIA laboratories. Thus, past challenges to FDA’s jurisdiction over
                             403
CLIA-administered LDTs          may recur here. One challenge is based on the enactment
of distinct statutory regimes for medical devices and clinical laboratory services.

WhenCongressexpandedthedefinitionof“medicaldevice”inthe1976Amendments,
the Clinical Laboratories Improvement Act of 1967 already provided for regulation
                                                                 404
of laboratory services—including then-existing LDTs.                The failure of the 1976

Amendments to mention CLIA, coupled with the minor role given to FDAin the 1988
Clinical Laboratories Improvement Amendments, support the inference that Congress
                                                                        405
did not intend to give FDAjurisdiction over laboratory services.
   While a device/service distinction is a fair inference from the statutory scheme, it
                                 406
seemsoutdatedinapplication. Laboratory services are far more complex and numerous

thantheywerein1976.Laboratory-developedgenetictestsareadvertisedandmarketed
nationally, 407just like FDA-approved test kits; FDAalready exercises jurisdiction over
                                                       408
some, though not all, components of DTC tests.            Under the circumstances, it seems
unlikely that a court would question a construction of the FD&C Act reaching DTC

genomic services.

   Alternatively, one could argue that theAdministrative ProcedureAct requires FDA
to promulgate a rule in order to reverse a longstanding exercise of “enforcement
             409
discretion.”    This has not yet happened with respect to LDTs: theASR rule excluded

subsequently moved (in fits and starts) toward LDT regulation. If DTC services are
LDTs, FDA’s assertion of authority should warrant judicial deference. If DTC services
are not LDTs, FDA never promised to exercise enforcement discretion toward them.

And either way, FDAcould easily overcome this argument by promulgating a rule.

C. Unfamiliar Territory: Regulating Information

   Both the speculative harms and the potential benefits of DTC genomic services are
derived from greater self-knowledge. Genomic services are essentially information
services,providingconsumerswithrawgenomicdata,andinterpretingthosedatainlight

of a corpus of scientific scholarship. While all medical diagnostics could be described
asinformationservices,predictivegenomeservicesaresetapartbytheirindeterminacy:
the information provided does not clearly instruct or advise action. Instead, it invites

furtherexploration,createsuncertainty,andmaychallengetheauthorityofthemedical
practitioner.
   1.GenerationandInterpretation.WhileDTCservicesareoftenassumedtobeLDTs,

FDA’s 2010 untitled letters indicate that DTC genomics services may not be LDTs if
they are “not developed by and used in a single laboratory.”     413 This statement may
offer a clue to FDA’s forthcoming DTC genomic service policies.     414Considered alone,

the stand-alone generation of genotype data by a CLIA-certified laboratory would fit
comfortably within the LDT category. But FDA seems to view the DTC company’s
subsequent interpretation ofthosedata,whichiscomputationalanddoesnottake

place in the laboratory, to be part of the “medical device.” While this is somewhat
counterintuitive,itisconsistentwithFDApractice:FDAregulatesinterpretivemedical
software together with the underlying diagnostic tests, and the agency has shown

increasing concern about complex tests, like IVDMIAs, that cannot be understood by
clinicians without a layer of interpretive processes.415
   Suppose, then, that a consumer obtains her raw genotype data from a clinical

laboratory.Assuming the data are generated for non-health purposes (such as ancestry
research), the test is not a “medical device.” She then sends her data to two DTC
interpretive services, and each generates a personalized report. Ancestry Company’s

report uses a database of SNP associations based on ethnographic studies of human
genealogy, while Health Company’s report uses a database of SNP associations based
onGWASstudiesofcommondiseases.Theinterpretivestepinvolvesnogenetictest,no

laboratory, and no human tissue sample. Neither company offers medical advice; they
provide a report with hyperlinks to relevant scientific and medical research literature.
FDA has disavowed authority over Ancestry Company’s service. But would Health

Company’sservicebea“medicaldevice”—evendecoupledfromthegenetictestitself?
   It appears likely, based on currently available evidence, that FDA would consider
Health Company’s service a medical device. Consider Knome, a developer of genome
                                 416
interpretation software tools.      At one point, Knome offered DNA sequencing,
     413E.g., Letter fromAlberto Gutierrez, Director, OIVD, FDA, to Jorge Conde, CEO, Knome, Inc.
(June 10, 2010).
     414Beyond its untitled letters, FDAhas not clarified why DTC services are not LDTs. FDAmay
also have concerns about other aspects of DTC services, such as mailing sample containers directly to

consumers, reporting results directly to consumers, or using gene chips meant for research use only.
Cf. Stein, supra note 189 (citing an unnamed FDAofficial, explaining that Pathway Genomics’service
requi415 approval because “it involved consumers collecting their own DNA”).
        See, e.g., Statement of Jeff Shuren, supra note 8 (noting that LDTs “often require complex
software and may incorporate automated interpretation in lieu of expert interpretation”); Magnus et al.,

andexplanatoryfunctions:“[KnomeCOMPLETE]describesthegeneticbasisofspecific
disease traits or conditions. Consumers may make medicaldecisions in relianceon this
               420
information.”      When asked in an interview why Knome was targeted, even though
its product was more like a “service” than a test, an FDA official explained that “[s]

oftware is a medical device, and [Knome is] making medical claims. They’re taking
results and making medical claims that come out of those results.”          421Asked whether

“pointing people to medical research papers” would also constitute a “medical claim,”
                              422
he answered, “It depends.”
   FDA has historically walked a fine line between regulating medical products and

regulating medical information. Medical texts and reference materials are not medical
devices (although they may constitute device labeling or advertising). But when these

resources are coupled with software providing personalized results tailored to a user,

health-related smartphone apps,     424including “mobile apps that allow the user to input

   The problem is that personalization is ubiquitous in the informational ecosystem. If

   2. Medical Claims. FDAasserts that DTC genetic tests come within the ambit of the
                                                                                               432
FD&CAct—and are therefore medical devices—“when they make medical claims.”
However, FDA’s conception of “medical claims” appears elastic, encompassing the

“genetic basis of specific disease traits or conditions on which consumers may base
medical decisions,” “personalized information” on medications, “genetic predispositions
                                                                         433
for important health conditions and medication sensitivities,”               andperhapseven
“pointing people to medical research papers.”        434Note that while FDA has disclaimed
statutory authority over ancestry tests, it is still unclear whether it considers research

tests to be medical devices; a crowdsourced study of a relatively innocuous trait, like
the genetics of Vitamin E response, would certainly involve “medical claims” under
                                     435

manufacturer representations as evidence of a device’s “intended use.”              However, in
the genomic context there has been some slippage. Consider a hypothetical statement

by a manufacturer of crib mattresses, that his product “…helps reduce ‘sinkhole’
effects linked to SIDS” or “reduces the risk of SIDS.” These are clearly medical
claims. 437 But it is less obvious that a tool for identifying whether a crib mattress has

such a “sinkhole” should be a medical device, even if it is sold with the claim “find
out if your crib mattress has a ‘sinkhole’linked to SIDS!” The discovery of a sinkhole

is valuable information, and it suggests an obvious health-related action (replace the
mattress). But what if the remedy were nonobvious, or the information were valuable

for non-health related purposes? FDA’s evaluation of medical claims seems to depend,
at least implicitly, on whether consumers’ hypothetical responses to the information
theyobtainarelikelytoincludehealth-relateddecisions.Butifthat’senough,wouldn’t

a cookbook be a medical device?

   3.TheFirstAmendment.Wheninformationisregulated,FirstAmendmentconcerns
                             438
are inevitably implicated.      A complete First Amendment analysis is far beyond the
scope of this Article. However, a few key points arise in light of the Supreme Court’s

recent decision in Sorrell v. IMS Health.
   Commercialspeechregulationsaregenerallyevaluatedunderthe               CentralHudsontest,

whichallowslawfulcommercialspeechtoberegulatedifdoingso“directlyadvances”
a “substantial” government interest in a manner that “is not more extensive than is
             439
necessary.”     Courts have traditionally given the government additional leeway for laws
and regulations safeguarding public health.      440However, recent cases may have shifted

this balance. For example, FDA’s authority to regulate supplement health claims has
been curtailed.  441Although that authority is not directly applicable to medical devices,

   Last year, in Sorrell v. IMS Health, the Court applied heightened scrutiny to strike
                                                                                              443
down a Vermont regulation prohibiting the sale of aggregate drug prescription data.
Justice Breyer, dissenting, warned that the opinion would place the constitutionality
                                 444
of FDA regulations in doubt.        Nonetheless, the majority opinion, penned by Justice
Kennedy,extendedFirstAmendmentprotectiontoinformationnottypicallythoughtof

as“speech”:prescriber-identifyinginformationusedfordata-miningbypharmaceutical
marketers. Rejecting the First Circuit’s characterization of such information as a

mere “commodity,” Justice Kennedy stated that “the creation and dissemination of
information are speech within the meaning of the FirstAmendment . . . Facts, after all,

are the beginning point for much of the speech that is most essential to advance human
knowledge.”   445

   Sorrell casts an intriguing light on DTC genetic data. If a file of automatically
collected prescriber data is “speech,” not a “commodity,” then a file of SNPgenotypes,

or a whole genome sequence, could likewise be speech. The Sorrell Court rejected

Vermont’s argument that the statute regulated not the act of speech, but rather access
to information.  446If “creating and disseminating” prescriber data (or genomic data) is

within the purview of the FirstAmendment, and conveying a file of prescriber data (or
genomic data) to a paying customer is “speech,” then barring parties from completing

subject to heightened scrutiny.
   Specialjudicialsolicitudeforaccesstoone’sowngenomicdatawoulddovetailnicely

with characterizations of the commercial speech doctrine as “oriented to the rights of
audiences to receive information” and intended to “protect the flow of information so

astoenhancethequalityofpublicdecision-making.” Of course, the First Amendment
does not require that the public be exposed to inaccurate or misleading information—
particularly if they are not qualified to evaluate it. Robert Post explains that courts turn

to “the disciplinary methods by which expert knowledge is created and certified” to
determine if the speech contributes to democratic competence and should therefore be
                                     449
covered by the First Amendment.         And the passage from Sorrell v. IMS Health that
opens thisArticle must be read in light of the sentence immediately following in, which

explainsthatFirstAmendmentprecepts“applywithfullforcewhentheaudience,inthis
caseprescribingphysicians,consistsof‘sophisticatedandexperienced’consumers.”              450
Thus,whilerejectingapaternalistapproachtoregulatinginformationexchange,Sorrell

left the door open for stricter restrictions where the audience is composed of non-
experts, because unsophisticated consumers require greater regulatory protection. It is

unclear whether that significantly mitigates Justice Breyer’s concern about weakening
FDA authority, since much of the speech FDA seeks to regulate is directed to expert

audiences, like prescribers. But it does clarify that Sorrell leaves the door open to FDA
regulation of DTC genomic services (or advertising thereof).

D. Hostile Territory: Personal Utility, Speculative Harms, and Risk-

     Based Regulation

   FDA’s safety and efficacy framework is a poor fit for predictive genomic tests.
Clinical evidence is often lacking, important benefits may be intangible, risks may be

overstated, and preapproval would be prohibitively resource-intense. Under FDA’s
current framework, it is unclear whether the agency would have the capacity to pre-

approve the current incarnation of DTC genomic services, even using a risk-based
model to allocate its resources.




     447Among the many differences between these situations, it is especially important to note that
patient privacy was not an issue in Sorrell. Had the “speech” implicated privacy concerns, the Court’s

   By statute, FDA is charged with assessing the safety and effectiveness of a given
                                                                         452
test, not its analytic validity, clinical validity, or clinical utility.    However, FDA has
considered the ACCE factors in the past, and will likely continue to do so. Various

commentators have suggested that gatekeepers (whether FDA or physicians) should
                                                                            453
handle genetic tests differentially on the basis of particular criteria.       FDAlikely does
not have discretion to suspend safety or efficacy, but it can modify its approach in light

of the product’s intended use.
   1.Clinicalutility.Clinical utility represents “a balance between health-related benefits
                                                       454
andtheharmsthatcanensuefromagenetictest.”                 It is contextual; a test with adequate
utility in one situation may lack utility in another.      455Even advocates of closer FDA

attention to clinical utility admit that “clinical utility still is somewhat like art: ‘I don’t
                                                    456
know what it is, but I know it when I see it.’”
   Clinicalutilityisproblematicasappliedtogenomicservices,becausediagnostictests,

standing alone, lack clinical utility. Clinical benefits only accrue when therapeutic or
preventive interventions are informed by the use of the diagnostic;         457for example, the

test for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) has clinical utility because
HER2-positivepatientswillrespondbettertothedrugHerceptin. Predictive genomic

tests,whicharegenerallyunabletoinformtreatment,lackclinicalutilityifitisdefined
             459
in this way.     Thus the evidence of significant clinical utility required for safety and
effectiveness is generally unattainable.

   The clinical utility problem has already been acknowledged in human subjects
research. Guidelines issued by two advisory organizations set “the bar for disclosure
                                 460
at (or near) clinical utility” —that is, where the information would be medically
actionable.ButanHHSworkinggroupwascriticizedthisstandardbecause“individuals

treatment is available,     and predictive testing for serious diseases like Alzheimer’s
can enable life planning and end stressful uncertainty.     467A common anecdotal benefit

ascribed to DTC services is that genomic information can provide a much-needed
stimulus to implement healthy lifestyle changes, like improved diet or exercise.

   In 2011, FDA’s Molecular and Clinical Genetics Advisory Panel discussed whether
FDAshouldconsiderpersonalutilitywhenevaluatingsafetyandeffectiveness(assuming

the agency has the statutory authority to do so). The results were mixed.         468Because

individuals react differently to the prospect of risk prediction, the “personal utility”
of information is hard to assess. Obtaining quantifiable evidence of it would be a tall

order.Butaccountingforpersonalutilitycouldbetheonlywaytodemonstratebenefits
derived from purely informational, non-diagnostic, yet health-related applications of

DTC genomic services.
   3. Speculative harms. FDAhas stated that it intends to apply risk-based oversight to

genome services. However, it is not at all clear what that will entail, since the alleged
harms of genomic testing     469are highly speculative, and little empirical data support
                 470
their existence.    Time and money are obvious costs; it is also plausible (though as yet
empirically unproven) that patients may change medicationsor skip mammograms.               471
                                                    472                  473
But concerns about prophylactic ovary removal          or mastectomies      seem farfetched:
for one thing, women could not unilaterally take those actions without a physician, so

a gatekeeper would be involved regardless. FDA does not yet seem to have resolved
which speculative harms would be considered in its risk-based framework. When

FDA’s Molecular and Clinical Genetics Panel considered whether evidence of anxiety

should be part of the safety determination, the panel’s nonbinding consensus was that
“legitimate data” about anxiety should be neither required nor ignored.       474 Regardless,

it is unclear how this would impact genomic services, because thus far, studies suggest
they do not cause undue anxiety.

   It seems likely that the projected harms of DTC genomic services have been
magnified through the lens of genetic exceptionalism, and genetic information that

consumer’s misconceptions about genomic services are magnified by misconceptions
about genetics, taking that into account is fair. DTC genome services provide detailed

explanatory materials and disclaimers to defuse such misconceptions,           however, and
while they could no doubt be improved upon, it is troubling that FDAseems unwilling

to credit those disclaimers as mitigating the risk of poor health decisions.
   4. Expert gatekeepers and genetic counseling. There seems to be little consensus
                                                                            476

physicianscanapproveconsumers’orders.Regulationswouldneedtobecraftedsothat,
if a gatekeeper is imposed, she will act in the best interests of the consumer, have no
conflictsofinterest,andbequalifiedtodiscusstheresultsofthetest—quiteachallenge.

   5. Resources. FDA currently evaluates the analytic validity and clinical validity of
diagnostics in premarket review. While these can be demonstrated for gene chip based

genomic tests, and thus pose less of a conceptual problem than clinical utility, clinical
validity is “is perhaps the most complex part of the [ACCE] evaluation process, and
                                                  478
requires significant expertise and resources.”       Clinical validity represents the test’s
accuracy in detecting the presence of, or predicting the risk for, a health condition or
             479
phenotype.” ButbecauseSNPsareonlyproxiesfornearbygenes,evenawell-validated
SNP-disease association may not hold true for every person.          480Boththescientific
validityofthesupportingstudiesandthetest’sexpectedperformanceinaspecificpatient

population would have to be considered. The strength of genetic associations varies
with ethnicity, environmental risk factors, and behaviors; given the lack of minorities
           481
in GWAS,      some associations may not be supported in non-Europeans, and the tests
would be ineffective for those groups.

     475See, e.g., Terms of ServiceAnDm e, https://www.23andme.com/about/tos/ (last visited Apr. 29,
2012):
     “You should not change your health behaviors solely on the basis of information from 23andMe. Make
sure to discuss your Genetic Information with a physician or other health care provider before you act upon

the Genetic Information resulting from 23andMe Services. For most common diseases, the genes we know
about are only responsible for a small fraction of the risk. There may be unknown genes, environmental
factors, or lifestyle choices that are far more important predictors. If your data indicate that you are not at
elevated genetic risk for a particular disease or condition, you should not feel that you are protected.”

   It would be very difficult for FDAto muster the resources to evaluate even a single
                                                482
genomic test in a reasonable amount of time.       CDC’s EGAPP completed only four
ACCE-based gene test associations between 2004-09,      483and none of those involved a
complex common disease, much less a million-SNP gene chip. While FDA’s staffing

and resources are much greater, it would be beyond any agency’s resources to monitor
the scientific and medical literature in order to dynamically re-evaluate the clinical

significance of each SNP in the human genome in real time. Realistically, premarket
processing of the tests would be delayed.  484
   Adding to the difficulty, DTC genomic services are bundles of individual SNP-

disease associations. FDA could leave all genomic services on the market pending
a risk-prioritized review. Alternatively, it could pull the highest-risk services off the

market.Athird option would involve identifying disease associations FDAdeems most
likely to cause harm (such as BRCA1/2,Alzheimer’s, etc.), and barring DTC services
from reporting those associations, pending review. Although the third option is best

tailoredtoFDA’sconcerns,itwouldbemessytoimplementbecauseoftheinformational
nature of genomic services.  485A DTC service could remove a high-risk SNP-disease

associationfromitsreports,orblocktherawgenotypedataforthatassociation,oralter
the laboratory process so that the SNPs were never genotyped, but regardless, such a
piecemeal system of approval seems highly problematic for FDA, for the regulated

industry, and for the consumer.


     iv. c   hoosinG    G atekeePers

   Even if it were possible to tailor an exceptional regulatory scheme just for DTC
genomic services, the rapid turnover and evolution in the DTC market, coupled with

the imminence of whole-genome testing, will soon supersede a regulatory framework
tailoredtocurrentSNPtechnology.Nevertheless,itisessentialtolayagroundworkthat
                                                       486
can adapt to a complex and information-rich future.       Currently, of FDA, CMS, and
FTC, FDAis the most actively engaged in the regulatory space.Yet FTC is the agency
tasked with addressing consumer confusion and exploitation. Why not keep all three

agencies involved, but reverse their relative commitments, so FTC and CMS take the
lead—a strategy that could be facilitated by statutory adjustments to CMS’ authority,

and discretionary forbearance by FDA?

A. CMS

   CMS already regulates clinical laboratories, and is in the right position to regulate
DTC genomic services conducted by those laboratories. However, CMS has limited

authority. CLIA does not give CMS authority to regulate clinical validity or clinical

     482Accelerated review, coupled with insufficient resources, time, and evidence, has caused problems
for FDAbefore. When FDAcontracted review of “old” drugs under the 1962 Kefauver-HarrisAmendments
totheNationalAcademyofSciences,theprocesswasflawedbyinsufficientdocumentationofefficacy,time
constraints, and procedural inconsistencies, leading to “findings [that] were more in the nature of educated

     484An abbreviated version ofACCE is used in the UK; if FDAwere able to streamline and

might be more feasible.

extent premarket approval is desired, CLIAdoes not give CMS premarket gatekeeping
authority. 489Perhapsbecauseoftheselimitations,SACGHSrecommendedthatCLIA’s

scope be expanded “to encompass the full range of health-related tests, including those
                                  490
offered directly to consumers.”      SACGHS envisioned complementary roles for CMS
andFDA,butdidnotspecifythedetails; however,SACGHSnotedthatCMSbelieved

Congress “did not expect CLIAto ensure the clinical validity of the tests” because “it
would have created duplicative roles for FDAand CLIA.”          492

     Various statutory fixes have been proposed to the CLIA regime. Recently, the
Modernizing Laboratory Test Standards for Patients Act of 2011, H.R. 3207, would

have extended CMS’authority to regulate LDTs, to require documentation of clinical
                                                                                            493
validity from labs, and to review clinical validity for new and existing DTC tests.
The bill would have required labs to notify CMS before introducing a new DTC test,

and created a databank for LDT and DTC tests. While the bill authorized additional
inspectors to assess clinical validity, it could have been improved by addressing the
                                                                                      494

FDAregulation and the current, inadequate system of CMS oversight.

B. FTC

   For its part, FTC should take an active role in regulating DTC advertising, and

ensuring that DTC genomic services neither oversimplify nor overstate their tests’
capabilities.For example,some information on 23andMe’s website is likely to confuse

potential consumers: visitors are invited to “find out if you may pass on risk genes for
40+ Inheritable Conditions (including Cystic Fibrosis, Breast Cancer, and Tay-Sachs).

…23andMe will tell you if you have any of these risk genes.”       496But 23andMe does not

genotype all genetic variants associated with these diseases, or sequence the complete
disease genes. With respect to breast cancer risk, it genotypes only the three BRCA1/2
                                                                              497

   23andMe discloses in multiple locations on its website that it screens only three of
                                           499
thehundredsofBRCA1/2geneticvariants. However, because users must click several
links to find this information, it could well be overlooked prior to (or after) purchase.

Similarly, 23andMe’s invitation to “estimate[] your genetic chances of getting Type 2
Diabetes” may confuse prospective consumers unaware that the “genetic chance” of
getting diabetes is far outweighed by non-genetic factors, like diet and exercise. This
                                                                                      500
is disclosed by 23andMe, but again, it may be overlooked by potential customers.
23andMe also discloses in a less-than-salient location whether the genetic associations
                                                                                      501
it reports are clinically supported in European, East Asian, or African populations.
This information is essential to prospective consumers’ability to evaluate the service’s
benefits, and should be highly visible before purchase without exhaustively touring

the site.
   Policing DTC service websites and advertising is squarely within FTC’s mandate.

However, FTC will need to partner with FDA to build the subject matter expertise
required to police misstatementsabout geneticrisk. Since FTC already relies on FDA’s

expertise in other contexts, this should be straightforward. And both agencies should
take an active role in the development of best practices and standards for reporting
genomic data.

   FDA can and should regulate medical devices within its statutory mandate, as
Congress intended, to protect the public from unsafe or ineffective products. For

complex LDTs requiring greater expertise than usual, FDAclearance or approval may
be a good thing complement to CMS regulation; FDA’s approach does not have to be
                 502
one-size-fits-all.  But for predictive tests generally, FDA should consider developing a
less cumbersome form ofACCE analysis (accounting for personal utility) more clearly

matched to its evaluation of device safety and effectiveness.
   FDA has a tradition of exercising enforcement discretion when its rigorous system
of premarket oversight would be excessive; it should invoke that tradition here. FDA

decisions, or advice. This policy would not turn on genetic exceptionalism; genomics,

metabolomics,proteomics,andotherhealthdatasetsshouldbetreatedconsistently.FDA
should also ensure that in the research context, personal information can be disclosed

to participants without jeopardizing the RUO status of IVD manufacturers.        503

   MostDTCconsumersdon’twantgovernmentgatekeeperslimitingaccesstogenomic
services. Since those services show no sign of harming consumers, there should be
                                      504
no reason to impose a gatekeeper.        But if a gatekeeper becomes necessary, a pre-
test physician gatekeeper would be much less burdensome than a pre-market FDA
            505
gatekeeper.     If FDA deems it necessary to impose a uniform national prescribing
standard for DTC tests, it should regulate DTC tests as Class II, and allow tests lacking

traditional clinical benefits to be approved on the basis of benefits cognizable under

“personal utility” (or its equivalent).
   2.ReportingStandardsandBestPractices.Several years ago, DTC genomic services

acknowledged the need for reporting standards and best practices to clarify their
communicationswithconsumers. Two years later, 23andMe requested help from NIH
                                               507
andFDAindevelopingreportingguidelines. FDA, CDC, NIH, and any other agencies
with relevant expertise should answer this call, and collaborate to create a common

vocabulary and set of parameters for genomic information reporting. An interagency

working group should also develop a plan, in collaboration with professional groups,
to train health care providers in genetics and statistics.

   3.Postmarketsurveillanceandadverseeventreporting.In2008,SACGHSreported
a deficit of studies documenting the harms of genetic testing. In subsequent years, that

deficit has not been remedied. As a result, FDA may be compelled to base premarket
review of genetic tests on hypothetical risks.Although there is currently no indication

thatDTCgenomicservicesareharmful,astheDTCconsumerprofileshiftsawayfrom
knowledgeableearlyadopters,orasmoretimepasses,projectedharmsmaymaterialize.

If they do materialize, it is essential for regulators to know and take action.

   The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 required FDA to
establish postmarket surveillance capacities for medical products.         508 In response,

FDAis developing a national postmarket risk assessment database called the Sentinel
System.  509As part of this system, FDA should consider establishing a longitudinal project

following DTC genomic service users and obtaining feedback on their experience.
     503
        Cf. 21 C.F.R. 812.2(c)(3) (2011). See also FDA, Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff: In Vitro
Diagnostic (IVD) Device Studies - Frequently Asked Questions 11 (June 25, 2010) (allowing research use
of diagnostic only insofar as it does not “influence patient treatment or clinical management decisions
before the diagnosis is established by a medically established product or procedure.”).
     504
        See, e.g., Kaufman, supra note 169 (66% of DTC consumers felt the services should be available
without government oversight, but wanted an organization like FTC to monitor companies’claims for
accuracy).
     505Because the practice of medicine exception only applies to legally marketed products, even physicians

can’t use an FDA-prohibited drug or device off-label. See FD&CAct § 906 (21 U.S.C. § 396) (“Nothing in
this [Act] shall be construed to limit or interfere with the authority of a health care practitioner to prescribe
or administer any legally marketed device to a patient for any condition or disease within a legitimate health
care practitioner-patient relationship. . . .”); cf. Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1, 28 (2005) (“the dispensing

of new drugs, even when doctors approve their use, must await federal approval”). See also R.S. Stafford,

Such a system could potentially yield more than adverse event reports: FDAcould also

leverage participatory research networks to collect long-term, post-test information. It
is notoriously difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of prophylactic treatments meant
to prevent long-term health problems,  510and currently, most studies of genetic tests are
                                                                                 511
“conducted in the premarket approval phase” with little postmarket evidence.        DTC
genomic services’ pre-existing customer networks could facilitate the crowdsourcing
                                    512
of longitudinal research projects.     While a collaboration between FDA and DTC
services may seem unlikely, it would signal a new openness on the agency’s part to
nontraditional research models.


     v. c    onclusion


   Inthe1970s,FDArejectedLaetrileusers’casehistoriesaslackingevidentiaryvalue,
and declined to approve research studies on the drug. Today, Laetrile users would
join PatientsLikeMe. In the 1980s, FDA refused to approve home HIV tests. Today,

synthetic biology enthusiasts can sequence genes in their garage, and order whole-
genome sequences online, for good or bad.    513The genomic genie is out of the bottle;

the gate has already been flung open. It may be prudent to close that gate a little—but
that decision should be based on something more than speculative hyperbole, and the
bugaboos of genetic exceptionalism.

   FDA’scenturyofexpertiseandauthorityisnotcalledintoseriousquestionbygenomic
information services, or by participatory research. But FDA would be best served

by admitting that it can’t regulate every DNA base pair, and not straining its limited
resources to try. It is not necessary to resolve at this point whether there is a “right”
to access one’s own genetic data that trumps FDA regulation, or whether predictive

genetic testing will ultimately live up to its promise. It is only necessary to recognize
