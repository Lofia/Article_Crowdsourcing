E XECUTIVE SUMMARY
The so-far short but crucial journey of 'Policy Making 2.0' through time followed closely the
advancements and offerings of different Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) as people

recognize that these could improve their way of living, not only at a personal level but most importantly
at a community and global level, influencing the way decisions are taken and implemented.


From the ancient times, humans have realised the importance of being part of, and playing an active
role in, community and this inclination has grown into a need for every human being over the ages.
Being part of a community offers a wide spectrum of benefits, such as securing food (in the pre-historic

age) to fighting for better working conditions (via the formation of labour unions in the last centuries).
However, the constantly growing complexity of our times and the modern way of living resulted in

leaving behind this need, a fact that gradually resulted in people losing the trust on their governments
and being unable to catch up with the policy making procedures.

Today, ICTs seem capable enough to strengthen the bond between citizens and decision makers, and as

people have re-discovered the advantages of being an active part of the society, they are
experimenting new ways to connect with each other towards achieving common goals. As such, Policy

Making 2.0 is an highly important domain and has been recognised by the European Commission as
one of the fundamental research areas that should be tackled by both researchers and policy makers,
especially in a future perspective and in view of the foreseen shift of our global science systems and

policy making responses.

This report presents the findings of the in-depth analysis of four case studies selected as being

representatives of the Policy making 2.0 realm, and it is the result of the collaborative effort of several
experts in the domain that have been actively engaged in the different phases of its implementation.

The aim of this activity was in first instance to identify and analyse in-depth case studies focusing on
real needs of users and policy makers, and highlighting the concrete problems addressed by research
and the impact of ICT solutions for Governance and Policy-Modelling on governance processes and

policy-making mechanisms.

The analysis included the identification and mapping of over 300 cases and practices from all over the
world, the description of a shortlist of 25 promising cases and the in-depth investigation of a

representative set of 4 cases which cover a wide spectrum of policy-making steps, domains and
methodologies/technologies/tools, through interviews with experts and end users directly engaged in

the selected cases, complemented by desk research and analysis of available documentation and data.
The key findings of the analysis have been then reviewed by experts and validated through consultation
with CROSSOVER's Animators and the community of Policy Making 2.0 through communicating results

to relevant web2.0 channels and incorporating relevant feedback into the analysis.

The findings of the deep analysis and the evaluation of lessons learned from concrete applications of
ICT solutions for Governance and Policy Modelling allows to shed light to important dimensions that

have been identified for possible integration into the CROSSOVER roadmap. This in turns will contribute
to enhance and deepen the research challenges forming altogether the emerging domain of Policy

Making 2.0.

                                   0313F02_Case studies on specific applications of ICT solutions for policy modelling




The results of the analysis and the insights from experts combined with consultation and validation

from the community allowed to draw conclusions in terms of recommendations for policy and future
research, in view of the establishment of Policy Making 2.0 as a defined set of methodologies and tools.

In this respect, the recommendations set out in this report, which are the direct outcome of the

activities of in-depth analysis of case studies and the work of mapping and identification of promising
cases, are aligned with the nature of Policy Making 2.0, which calls for more open, collaborative and

evidence-based decisions. These needs are still not fully covered, as the analysis conducted reveals that
many of these prerequisites are still lacking even after several years of research and deployment.


After presenting the results of a cross-case analysis and reflections on how to integrate findings into
the CROSSOVER's Roadmap, the report concludes offering two sets of recommendations addressed
both to policy makers and to practitioners/researchers active in the Policy Making 2.0 domain.


The first set of recommendations regards the presentation of policy implications as captured by the
analysis and the interviews conducted with experts involved in the cases investigated.


Those are summarised in the so called 'Decalogue of policy Making 2.0' as follows:

   P.R.#1.     Build your case in Policy Making 2.0 in an agile manner.
   P.R.#2.     Continuously embed high-quality (open) data into your policy models.
   P.R.#3.     Tap the power of visualization and social networks to effectively communicate policy

               outcomes.
   P.R.#4.     Invest in real-time simulation technologies.
   P.R.#5.     Create intuitive, yet diverse interfaces depending on the profile of the stakeholders.
   P.R.#6.     Bring together multi-disciplinary expertise.
   P.R.#7.     Engage stakeholders from the very beginning.

   P.R.#8.     Incubate your case into the interested public organization.
   P.R.#9.     Treat your case as a product/service to ensure sustainability and further development.
   P.R.#10.    Think out-of-the box for the deployment of your case in other settings and contexts.

The second set of recommendations aims to provide the necessary input in order to complement and

further enhance the CROSSOVER Roadmap on Policy making 2.0, based on the reflections of the
findings gathered and the in-depth analysis of the four cases compared against the emerging results of

the roadmapping exercise.

Those are the summarised by the following:

   R.R.#1.     Think of the Roadmap’s Elements as Nodes in a Connected Graph
   R.R.#2.     Build Clusters of Research Challenges and Define Policy Making “Enablers”

   R.R.#3.     Shift from Gov Labs to Open Apps
   R.R.#4.     Define the Timing Horizon for Research

These recommendations are the main conclusions of the in-depth analysis of selected case studies and

should be used (possibly upon further validation with other cases and by the community of experts,
practitioners, researchers and policy makers involved in the Policy Making 2.0 debate) for the
enrichment of the final version of the CROSSOVER Roadmap on Policy Making 2.0.

1. Introduction

1.1 Purpose and Structure of the Report

This document presents the final report of the activities conducted as part of Task 5.2 Case Studies on
specific applications of ICT solutions for governance and policy modelling of the CROSSOVER project. It

includes a presentation of the integrated methodology followed for this component of the research
and a presentation of the four (4) selected cases, including the main findings of the analysis of each
case accompanied by highlights and critical opinions, the lessons learned and the practical

recommendations (deriving from the integrated analysis) towards their integration into the Final
version of the International Research Roadmap on Policy-Making 2.0, ultimate outcome of the

CROSSOVER project.

The report integrates the findings of the research work coordinated by the JRC-IPTS and which was
performed in part through subcontracting the activities of identification and analysis of the selected

case studies to a team of experts of the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA). It also
combines input received from various sources in the course of the implementation of the research,

including: desk research, consultation with CROSSOVER consortium members and the CROSSOVER
animators who reviewed intermediate deliverables, as well as interviews with experts involved in each
one of the four proposed cases (including members of the project teams and some end-users).


Intermediate draft versions of the report and key findings have also been made available for public
consultation and validation through communication and discussion of the results with the CROSSOVER

animators, the CROSSOVER partners and with the community that follows closely the Policy Making 2.0
domain over various Web 2.0 channels. The final analysis of the four cases combined with the critical
comments received by the practitioners/end users of the cases and of the CROSSOVER animators have

been used to outline the recommendations about Policy Making 2.0 and about the development of the
CROSSOVER Research Roadmap.


The document is therefore structured as follows. Section 2 presents the rationale underpinning Task
5.2 within the overall framework of the project and the methodological approach followed. Section 3
outlines the key findings emerging from the investigation through a brief presentation and a critical

analysis of the four selected cases analysed in depth. In Section 4 a cross case analysis is presented
outlining similarities and differences of the cases and drawing policy recommendations emerging from

the research. Section 5 provides some insights in view of integrating the findings of the case studies
into the Research Roadmap, presenting some reflections deriving from the analysis and practical
recommendations for improving the CROSSOVER's Roadmap on Policy making 2.0. Finally Section 6

draws some brief conclusions summarising the main findings and recommendations. In the Annexes A-
D of the report are presented respectively: the detailed review of the four case studies; the interviews

with selected experts per each case; the brief analysis of 25 shortlisted cases and the list of Complete
Set of Cases Initially Identified.

1.2 Objectives of Task 5.2 within CROSSOVER
The CROSSOVER project indicates in its Description of Work (DoW) that Task T5.2 'Identification and

Analysis of Case Studies on specific applications of ICT solutions for Governance and Policy
Modelling' should be conducted between M8 (May 2012) and M18 (March 2013). These specific case

studies are analysed more in-depth relative to a larger set of cases included in the repository of news
and cases prepared during the first phase of the project's implementation. In particular, building on the
results of WP1, and more specifically the repository of tools and the news and cases identified, the

International Roadmap on ICT tools for Governance and Policy Modelling outlined in WP2 will be further
enhanced through four case studies on specific applications of ICT solutions for governance and policy

modelling (in WP5).

JRC-IPTS is responsible for coordinating the activities related to Task 5.2 and in particular the

conduction of research, analysis, drafting and editing of the in-depth cases studies to enhance and
deepen the roadmap. The aim of Task 5.2 is to analyse case studies focusing on real needs of users and
policy makers and highlighting the concrete problems solved and the impact of ICT solutions for

Governance and Policy-Modelling. For this purpose, in addition to specific policy analysis to design the
methodology for case study identification and analysis, the JRC-IPTS decided to sub-contract part of the

activities to external researchers, in order to guarantee the knowledge base required to conduct the
analysis.

The general objective of the sub-contract consisted of conducting research to map and identify

promising cases of applications of ICT solutions for governance and policy modelling, select and analyse
in depth four good practice cases in collaboration with JRC-IPTS and CROSSOVER's partners. The four in-

depth case studies aim at contributing to enhance and deepen the CROSSOVER roadmap being
developed by the CROSSOVER's Consortium's partners, and at evaluating the lesson learned and

impacts from implementation of ICT solutions for governance and policy modelling at both European
and global level.

The result of the combined activities of JRC-IPTS and other CROSSOVER's partners, in collaboration with

the team of the sub-contractor was to provide a comprehensive analysis covering the methodological
approach followed, a synthesis of findings of the mapping of cases and the detailed analysis of the four

in-depth case studies identified, as well as the cross-analysis of the cases on ICT solutions for
governance and policy modelling, drawing conclusions in terms of recommendations for policy and

future research to be incorporated into the final version of the CROSSOVER Roadmap.

Task 5.2 started on April 2012 (M7) and the JRC-IPTS prepared the draft Technical Specifications for the
subcontracting in May 2012. Further to internal review and consultation, following the results of the

first Project's Review meeting, the procurement process initiated in June 2012 and concluded in August
2012. Two offers were received and after evaluation, the notification of award to the winning
                                       th                                                 th
contractor has been submitted on 10 September 2012. The contract initiated on 16 October 2012
and was concluded at the beginning of February 2013. Meanwhile, the JRC-IPTS developed the overall

methodological approach and presented it as an Interim Report of D5.2 for discussion during the
Project's Review in October 2012.

2. Analysis of Case studies: Rationale and Methodological Approach


2.1 Rationale

The rationale for conducting in depth case studies as part of the CROSSOVER project is to enrich the
Research Roadmap, one of the ultimate outcomes of the project, and provide concrete examples on

how ICT solutions for governance and policy modelling work in reality, in different contexts and policy

domains. For this reason the analysis of case studies started and was conducted once the Roadmap

reached an advanced state of development and its architecture had been validated by stakeholders.

Before proceeding with the presentation of the methodological approach and the findings from the

analysis if case studies, it is required to briefly set the stage and present the background to the specific
research in the area of ICT for governance and policy modelling, outlining the guiding principles and the

current state of the art from which the analysis was built on.

First of all, it is now becoming commonly accepted that the world has become increasingly

interconnected, complex, and fast evolving, with the effects of policy choices and of individual
                                                   1,2
behaviours becoming much less predictable . Society currently faces a set of new challenges that are
global in scale and highly dynamic. In fact, uncertainty and complexity are two distinguishing

characteristics of our society, as widely recognised in the literature of complexity science, chaos theory
                                                            3                              4
and non-linear systems. Highly improbable events and “wicked problems” , which are outside the
range of predictability based on past behaviour, dominate our lives as the current financial and

economic crisis has proven. To formulate adaptive policies for the future of the globally connected

world, and for responding to today’s crises, requires the simultaneous consideration of many factors,
different types of data and how these interact .     5


Within such a context, ICT emerges as an important enabler for handling complexity and for driving

state reorganisation, openness and effectiveness in collaboration with citizens, businesses and society.
ICT-assisted policy making can describe complex problems and provide evidence for policy design with

a staggering amount of interactive simulations and visualizations that add to the legitimacy of the

decisions while enabling citizens to understand, participate and even change their behaviour. Modern
approaches in policy making, taking into account political, economic, social, technological,

environmental and legal repercussions, consider a variety of different disciplines ranging from complex

systems, decision support systems, and public administration concepts, to operational research
models.

However, the current tools available for policy design, implementation and evaluation still seem ill-
                                                                                                6 7
suited for capturing the society’s complex and interconnected nature , . In addition, although

modelling and simulation techniques have the potential to be important elements for handling

complexity and evidence-based decision making, current use of available tools is not marked by a
record of success that would gain the confidence of stakeholders in policy making .                   8


In parallel, social media appear today as a global phenomenon around cooperation, collective

intelligence, users generating content, sharing and connecting, with a disruptive impact on all aspects
                                                9,10,11
of society, government, and business                 . A new age of engagement has emerged, leveraging social

media for policy making as they facilitate the requisite level of collaboration both globally and locally to
solve complex issues that would otherwise be impossible to address                   12,1. Social media make the process

of engaging citizens in policy making easier and less costly than ever before by providing tools to
                                                                     14
support knowledge-creation and community-building . Citizen engagement is introduced into the

policy process by using citizen-sourcing to enlarge and enhance policy-advisory processes, policy
                                   15
making, and policy feedback .

Government 2.0 has now become a new source of policy advice, enabling policy makers to bring
                                                                                                                          16
together divergent ideas that would not come from traditional sources of policy advice . As

governments may have neither the resources nor the necessary know-how to deal with the myriad

challenges that arise, the 'wisdom of the crowds', by horizontally sharing and analyzing each and every

involved citizens’ status, opinion, preferences, reviews, ratings, and needs around specific issues in the
various social media (respecting their privacy at the same time), brings to the table a global expertise

that reduces the information asymmetry between governments and citizens.


Finally, the public sector collects, produces, reproduces and disseminates a wide range of information

in many areas of activity, such as social, economic, geographical, weather, tourist, business, patent and
educational information, commonly known as Public Sector Information (PSI) .                    17


In recent years, open data initiatives providing public sector information in “free-as-in-speech” manner

for public, private and non-profit/civic consumption have flourished at an international and pan-

European level. Numerous web and mobile applications exploiting open data have emerged leading to
the characterization of open data as an effective engine of economic growth, social wellbeing, political
                                                         18
accountability and public service improvement . It is now well accepted that such open data also serve

as a significant key ingredient in the policy making process for understanding the existing situation and
feeding policy models.


However, the open challenge is how to elicit such information from open data initiatives and social

media in real-time and based on reliable visual analytics and sentiment analysis techniques. During the
overall model construction and use, legitimate open and social data (as two sides of the same coin )                       19

assist decision makers to learn how a certain system works and ultimately gain insights (knowledge)

and understanding (apply the extracted knowledge from those processes) in order to successfully

implement a desired policy. In fact, while it needs to be mentioned that, during the last years, a
plethora of bottom-up initiatives        20,21,22,23,2to promote transparency, collaboration and better policy

making has emerged creating a new landscape of communication between society and governmental

authorities, evidence of impacts of ICT solutions for governance and policy modeling, describing in

details the benefits and the key elements to ensure possible transferability and scalability, are little
researched or readily available to the various communities of practice, researchers and policy-makers

alike.





2.2 Methodological Approach


2.2.1 Research Design

The methodology to be followed to conduct the activities of Task 5.2 and in particular the identification

and in-depth analysis of selected case studies has been carefully designed by the JRC-IPTS and further

elaborated in collaboration with the sub-contractor (NTUA) which implements part of the research to

identify and analyse the selected case studies, and in consultation with CROSSOVER's partners and
animators, in order to comply with the work plan needed to carry out the activities based on the

technical specifications set out by the JRC-IPTS.

In order to identify, research and analyse in-depth four Case Studies of promising applications of ICT

solutions for governance and policy modeling in the most efficient and effective way, a multi-stage

methodology was developed, bearing the following steps, as depicted in Figure 1 here below.

2.2.2 Implementation of the Methodological Approach

In order to achieve the envisioned results in a transparent, open and documented manner, ensuring
the timely and effective delivery of findings, the methodological approach formulated resulted in the

following nine steps:


   i.     Identification of a large number of sources for relevant cases/ initiatives, through an extensive
                                                                                      25         26           27
          desk research and peer-to-peer brainstorming (e.g. ePractice , JoinUp , Scopus , ISI Web of
          Knowledge portals)


   ii.    Formulation and enrichment of an initial extensive, yet not exhaustive, list of candidate cases

          (more than 300 entries, deriving from almost every continent and applied in various policy

          domains)


  iii.    Design and implementation of a suitable Cases’ Description Template, in order to capture all

          the necessary information regarding each case in an effective and efficient manner

  iv.   Definition and application (based on collected information through the aforementioned

        template) of a set of “1st Round Criteria” in order to filter the initial set of candidate cases and
        limit their number to 25


  v.    Description of the 25 selected cases, and, through a second set of selection and prioritization
        criteria, selection of a limited set of the 10 most relevant cases (An Internal Report 'Descriptive
        database of cases with at least 20 relevant entries' has been drafted and shared for review with

        CROSSOVER's partners and animators in October 2012).

  vi.   Further elaboration on and enrichment of the collected data regarding the top 10 cases

        identified in consultation with CROSSOVER's partners and animators.

 vii.   Definition and application of a 3rd set of selection and prioritization criteria, in order to identify

        the four (4) most suitable and promising cases to be proposed for the needs of the CROSSOVER
        Roadmap (An Internal Report 'Brief analysis of cases available in the database and shortlist of

        most promising cases with analysis to support selection' has been drafted and shared for
        discussion with CROSSOVER's partners and animators in November 2012).

 viii.  Validation of the four (4) proposed cases in consultation with the whole CROSSOVER

        consortium, animators and community

  ix.   Extensive description of and elaboration on the four selected cases (through extensive desk

        research, interviews with members of each one of the four selected cases, interviews with
        actual users of the four selected cases etc. in order to derive valuable feedback, policy

        implications and recommendations targeted towards the CROSSOVER Roadmap. A draft
        Interim Report 'Case Study Analysis' has been drafted and shared for review with CROSSOVER's
        partners and animators in December 2012, and a version incorporating comments from

        reviewers has bee then made available for public consultation and validation in January 2013
        through main web2.0 channels .


Each of the steps described above resulted being demanding and therefore individual methodological
approaches have been formulated and followed as described in detail in the following sections.


2.2.2.1   Identifying and Analysing 25 Cases studies out of a Pool of 335 Candidates
The research team conducting the study gathered basic data and documentation from a number of

resources and examined their relevance to the specific needs and requirements of ICT for Governance
and Policy Modelling. This exercise resulted initially in producing a set of 335 Policy making 2.0 cases
out of which twenty five (25) practices prevailed as being of high relevance to the scope of the study.

For each of these practices, various data have been documented, such as the context of each case, the
objectives, the activities performed, the main results and other relevant and useful material that could

contribute or be aligned to the different research challenges defined in the CROSSOVER draft Roadmap.
During this task, the research team first identified and prioritized potential sources of information

ranging from targeted information gathering portals to traditional search engines, academic literature
databases and social media in order to gather relevant information and cases. These were matched
with the existing datasets of practices collected during previous workpackages (namely WP1 and WP2).

In addition to this, an open invitation for proposal of cases through main social media and web2.0

channels used by the project have been disseminated, aiming at reaching out potential cases and

practices that would have not been possible identify through the previous mapping exercises. In
parallel to this, a 1st-set of criteria for selecting at the initial set of practices was defined and practices

were described using a common template for documenting and comparing the practices. (see Table 1).

2.2.2.2    Methodology for Selecting the 4 Most Appropriate Cases

Following the identification and description of a preliminary set of 25 promising cases, the JRC-IPTS in
collaboration with NTUA and other partners of the CROSSOVER project, identified a shortlist of ten (10)

possible cases out of the total number of cases that have been documented previously, who served as
the basis for selection of the four (4) case studies to be analysed in depth in the next steps. Towards

this direction, the following steps have been implemented:

        Definition of a 2nd-set of criteria for selecting the final candidate cases. Through these criteria
         the target was to shortlist a small, but representative number of cases that will be aligned with

         the current landscape in terms of the research themes explored in the CROSSOVER project.

        Application of a multi-criteria method for ranking short-listing the case studies. This exercise

         has been performed through the application of the aforementioned set of criteria on the initial
         set of the twenty-five (25) cases that have been identified and resulted to a limited set of ten
         (10) cases which are considered as most promising and representative of the current

         landscape, based on the research challenges that have been identified in the CROSSOVER
         Roadmap.



In order to proceed to the selection of the candidate cases, a multi-criteria methodology was used.29

The idea was to prioritise the cases on the basis on the specific criteria for judging which cases are
more appropriate and mature in order to be used at the next steps of the study. The multi-criteria
                                                                                                               30
method selected and applied for prioritising the cases is based on the Analytic Network Process
                                                                                 31
(ANP), a more general form of the well known Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) used in multi-criteria
decision analysis .2

ANP is a multi-criteria theory of measurement used to derive relative priority scales of absolute
numbers from individual judgments (or from actual measurements normalized to a relative form) that

also belong to a fundamental scale of absolute numbers. These judgments represent the relative
influence, of one of two elements over the other in a pair wise comparison process on a third element

in the system, with respect to an underlying control criterion. The ANP is an essential tool for
articulating our understanding of a decision problem.


The first step for implementing the method had to do with the construction of the model. The criteria
have been applied to the model by categorising them in three clusters that have to do with the

importance of the cases to policy makers and relevant stakeholders, the relevance of the case to the
results of the CROSSOVER research project and the sophistication and availability of the cases.

                           Table 2: Ranking of the 25 shortlisted cases


The derived set of candidate cases was proposed to CROSSOVER's partners and animators for deciding
on the appropriateness of the cases and for finalising the shortlist of the 10 shortlisted candidates. This

was conducted in order to verify the appropriateness of the cases identified in order to proceed to the
detailed analysis of each different case. The 10 candidates have been therefore identified and more
information about each case has been gathered, not only through available online resources, but also
through direct communication with the responsible persons for each case. In parallel to this a third set
of criteria for selecting four (4) 'good practices' has been defined. Such criteria mainly focused on their

appropriateness to the themes of the CROSSOVER Roadmap and have been developed so that they can
identify the four (4) cases that capture as many aspects as possible of the Policy Making 2.0 domain.
Discussion among the CROSSOVER consortium and consultation with animators on the final set of cases
to be selected for in-depth analysis took also place before deciding on the four (4) cases to be selected.

The criteria selected for proposing the final four cases are the following:

            1. The 4 cases should altogether capture both Research Challenges of the Roadmap
            2. The 4 cases should altogether cover as many sub-challenges as possible
            3. The 4 cases should altogether cover if possible the Local, Regional and International
                dimension.

            4. Each one of the 4 cases should target a different policy area / application domain (e.g.
                Environment, Energy, Health, Finance, Labour, Youth, etc.)
            5. The cases should have a balance among cases within and outside of the EU.
            6. The responsible persons of the cases should be available to be interviewed and provide
                documentation and insights.



In applying these criteria, the following cases were identified as suitable candidates for in-depth
analysis:



       “2050 Pathways analysis”, “C-ROADS” and “GAINS” were cases targeting all Environment and
        Energy Efficiency policies, and almost the same CROSSOVER Research Challenges, while all are
        based in the EU and have Regional reach. The main proposal from these cases was considered
        to be “2050 Pathways analysis” for which the UK Department of Energy expressed high interest

        in participating in the analysis.

       “GLEAM”, targeting health and mobility at global level, having an international reach was also
        identified as a promising and relevant practice, and communication with the implementation
        team was already established.


       “Opinon Space 3.0” was considered the best candidate outside the EU (targeting Foreign Policy
        at US and global level) and the case responsible expressed high interest. The second candidate
        for a case outside the EU was MEL-C (targeting Youth in New Zealand), which was also was

        contacted.

       “URBANSIM”, targeting Urban Planning was another candidate highly ranked with many
        applications in both the US and the EU, and a communication channel with them has been also
        established easily.





Based on the above-mentioned criteria and analysis, the final list of cases proposed for analysis
resulted in the following (see Table 3 below).

2.2.2.3      Reports of the Four (4) Case Studies

Following the selection of the four most promising cases, the JRC-IPTS in collaboration with NTUA dealt


with the analysis of the cases mostly based on the input received through the interviews (see Annex B)

conducted with the team engaged in these studies (either as researchers or practitioners that worked


for the implementation or as users of the tools). The questions for conducting the interviews were

based on the general directions provided by the analysis framework that was defined in the previous


part of the study in order to be able to capture important aspects that were not publicly available on

the information sources of these cases.

                                  0313F02_Case studies on specific applications of ICT solutions for policy modelling




As a result, the analysis of these cases was performed not only through desk-based research but also

(and more deeply) through direct exchanges with selected members that have been involved in each
case study in order to verify advertised results and to acquire more information (such as impact,

usefulness, drawbacks, advantages, business opportunities, etc.).

In more details, during this activity, the following activities were carried out:
   Desk research to analyse relevant data and documentation available and Identification of contact

    persons per each case. This was based on the work conducted in the previous steps and the in-
    depth analysis was performed in order to acquire a better understanding for each case in an
    attempt to prepare the team for the interview.


   Design of an interview template, in collaboration between JRC-IPTS, NTUA and other CROSSOVER's
    partners, which has been sent to the cases’ representatives prior to the interviews. The template
    has been carefully constructed in order to get all required information about each case, trying to
    capture the issues of value for the next steps of the analysis. The idea behind the creation of the
    template was to let people know about the upcoming questions to be better prepared and to guide

    the discussion to the themes that the investigation needed to touch upon.

   Conduction of qualitative in-depth interviews with representatives of the organisations involved in
    each selected case. Interviews have been carried out through teleconferencing and have been
    recorded. Each interview lasted around 90 min on average and was attended by representatives of

    JRC-IPTS, NTUA and other CROSSOVER partners.

   Identification of additional stakeholders per case for further information retrieval, from the policy
    perspective to the extent this was possible, as the workload of the high level people identified was
    a restraining factor for conducting interviews. For the purpose of this step, the study’s team has

    asked the interviewed persons to identify policy makers and decision makers that could be
    interviewed at a later stage. After this step, an invitation to an interview was send to the identified
    persons, for conducting a short interview where they could express their views on the specific case.

   Conduction of further interviews with decision makers/policy makers utilising the tool. During this

    step, the study’s team arranged short conference calls with decision makers to extract their
    thoughts on the usability of each case and to report on how it is being implemented by their
    organisation.

   Reporting on the interviews and validation of the final output with the interviewed persons.


   Consultation of the acquired feedback with the CROSSOVER Animators for enhancing and improving
    the final results, based on their expertise. In addition to this, a draft report of the Analysis of Case
    studies has been made available through main online communities relevant to CROSOVER for public
    consultation and validation of findings.

3. Outline and concise analysis of the four case studies selected
As described above in section 2 on the methodological approach, the process followed to identifying

the four most appropriate and promising cases to be included in the CROSSOVER Roadmap was both
targeted and detailed. Thus, it can be assumed that several important messages can be derived from
each of the four cases and possibly be generalised or being of inspiration for transferability to similar

cases in different contexts or application domains.

The purpose of this section is to offer a focused and “to-the-point” presentation of the key highlights of
each of the four cases analysed in-depth, integrated with remarks, propositions and opinions deriving

from various experts and/or stakeholders received as additional and valuable feedback during the
analysis and/or the review and validation of the findings emerged from consultation with experts and
the public.




3.1 2050 Pathways Analysis

3.1.1 General Information

The UK Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) built the 2050 Calculator to help the public

engage in the debate, and for Government to ensure that its short- and medium-term planning was
consistent with achieving the long-term aim of environmental protection through increasing energy

efficiency in the country.
The 2050 Pathways Analysis features four practical resources:

    1. A web-based tool for the public to experiment with their own ideas for reducing greenhouse

        gas emissions.
    2. An in depth Excel-based tool and reporting system which includes the methodology/the models
        that are used for the underpinning analysis.

    3. A web-based presentation for younger audiences about greenhouse gas emissions.
    4. A toolkit for leading an energy debate in schools.


2050 Pathways is a tool to help policy makers, the energy industry and the public better understand the
impact of alternative choices in relation to energy production and consumption. For each sector of the
economy, four alternative trajectories have been developed, ranging from little or no effort to reduce

emissions or save energy (level 1) to extremely ambitious changes that push towards the physical or
technical limits of what can be achieved (level 4).

The 2050 Calculator is targeted at citizens, policy makers, senior officials and politicians as well as
technical experts through different interfaces.

3.1.2 Key Highlights

2050 Pathways Analysis has proved to be a very successful initiative in terms of end-user engagement.

In the first three months from the official launch of the project there were already about 10.000 unique
visitors to the platform. Regarding My2050, there are over 16.000 pathways up to the date, while
about 200 stakeholders were involved in the initial (building) phase. After the launch, about 500

stakeholders were engaged. Moreover, a week-long online debate including several experts took place
with many comments and active participation from citizens in an open public consultation.


The take-up of the initiative can also be considered successful: the UK “Carbon Plan 2011” a policy
strategy document set up by the British government (how will the UK look in 2050) included as one of
the main pieces of evidence and visualisation the 2050 Pathways Calculator. In addition, there are

education programs, both in and outside of the UK, that engage the 2050 Pathways models and tools in
their courses.


Moreover, the 2050 Pathways has been presented to -and has received appreciation from- a variety of
audiences, including the EC, NGOs, conferences, open media (including the BBC website) etc.


One of the key components of the 2050 Pathways analysis is the available data. Thus, in parallel with
the project team’s plan to apply the analysis to more countries (e.g. China, Indonesia, South Africa,
Bangladesh), there is a constant effort towards improving and enriching the available data underlying

the model and the rendering of results through the visualisation and gaming tools.

3.1.3 Appraisal from end users and review of experts


Feedback deriving from end users and/ or experts related to the CROSSOVER project reported that the
2050 Pathways Analysis is in fact an interesting, useful and innovative initiative. Many workshops and
surveys have been carried out, based either on the 2050 Calculator or on the My2050 visualisation tool.

                                0313F02_Case studies on specific applications of ICT solutions for policy modelling





However, it was noted that, unlike the My2050 web-based visualisation, the 2050 Calculator is quite
complicated and cannot be easily understood and utilized by the ordinary end user (e.g. ordinary

citizen or even policy makers without support). In addition, it was proposed to replace the excel-based
tool (that the analysis is based upon) with something more sophisticated. Regarding dissemination,

there was a high criticism on not utilizing social media; the 2050 Pathways Analysis team should
consider the integration of social channels in their dissemination strategy. Last but not least, it would

be interesting to see a comparison of the actual results to those calculated by the 2050 model; in case
the propositions made through the 2050 Calculator are adopted and implemented.




3.2 GLEAM

3.2.1 General Information

                                                 34
The global epidemic and mobility model, GLEAM , is a discrete stochastic epidemic computational
model based on a meta-population approach in which the world is defined in geographical census areas

connected in a network of interactions by human travel fluxes corresponding to transportation
infrastructures and mobility patterns.

                                                                     35
The GLEAM 2.0 simulation engine includes a multi-scale mobility model integrating different layers of
transportation networks going from the long range airline connections to the short range daily
                   36
commuting pattern and it elaborates stochastic infectious disease models to support a wide range of
epidemiological studies, covering different types of infections and intervention scenarios in order to

respond to the spread of a pandemic crisis in very short times.

Real-world data on population and mobility networks are used and integrate those in structured spatial

epidemic models to generate data driven simulations of the worldwide spread of infectious diseases.

3.2.2 Key Highlights


The first highlight regarding GLEAM is the amount, complexity and diversity of data the team has

managed to collect and organise (e.g. detailed airline transportation model). Data from census
agencies, data regarding population at very high resolutions, data from a world map implemented by

NASA with the world population divided to 5x5 miles area boxes, the entire database of airlines, about
40 databases from different countries for local mobility, transfer etc. are utilized.


In addition, it has to be mentioned that GLEAM has moved beyond research in the H1N1 epidemic case;

when the simulation derived from the application of GLEAM was used ex-post and resulted in a
particularly accurate analysis.

                                                                                        37                 38
GLEAM is nowadays utilized both in research initiatives (e.g. EPIWORK IP project , EPIFOR project )
and in formal policy making agencies (e.g. US Defense Agency). Moreover, GLEAM can also be met in

educational courses; both in a high school and at the university level.


3.2.3 Appraisal from end users and review of experts

During the analysis it has been reported that, due to the GLEAM’s highly sophisticated and complex

model, the end user has to devote some time in getting familiar with the model and workflow, before

being able to utilize it; even when talking about policy makers and not just ordinary citizens.
Complementary to this, GLEAM asks for a huge amount of data, thus it is quite difficult (especially when

not engaging large and active public agencies) to find and retrieve all the necessary information in
order to achieve the desirable result. Therefore, the creation of and open call for contribution to a

shared platform aiming to collecting and organising large amounts of relevant data is advisable.


In addition, while the model is indisputably the best solution in diseases spread through transportation
(and specifically airlines), it might be too sophisticated when dealing with more restricted areas of

application. Last but not least, if not already done so, the GLEAM project team should search for
collaborations with public administrations and/ or NGOs, in order to achieve great results in terms of

public health and related applications.

3.3 Opinion Space 3.0


3.3.1 General Information

Launched by the U.S. Department of State, Opinion Space bridges the worlds of politics and social
media in an interactive visualization forum, where users can engage in open dialog on foreign affairs

and global policies. It invites users to share their perspectives and ideas in an innovative visual "opinion
map" that illustrates which ideas result in the most active discussions and which ideas are judged most

insightful by the community of participants. Using an experimental gaming model, Opinion Space
incorporates techniques from deliberative polling, collaborative filtering, and multidimensional
visualization. The result is a self-organizing system that uses an intuitive graphical "map" that displays

patterns, trends, and insights as they emerge and employs the 'wisdom of the crowd' to identify and
highlight the most insightful opinions and comments.


In summary, Opinion Space helps policy makers:

       Understand the diversity of their communities
       Solicit feedback and creative suggestions on specific topics
       Rapidly identify the most insightful ideas and suggestions
       Increase satisfaction and engagement with their communities

Opinion Space also helps citizens:

       Visualize their relationships to other people
       Express thoughtful ideas and suggestions about emerging issues

       Engage in friendly competition with other people
       Learn and gain insights from other people

3.3.2 Key Highlights


Opinion Space, in the few years of its life (active from 2009), has achieved to be part of the formal
procedures of both public (e.g. US State Department ) and private (e.g. Fujitsu , UniLever ) bodies.


As far as end user engagement is concerned, Opinion Space has involved a large number of
stakeholders, both from the public at large and from targeted organisations (private companies, public

administrations, NGOs, etc.). It has to be noted that in some projects the visitors’ participation rate
(how many users actually engage themselves with the platform, compared to the number that visited

the platform in total) was close to 50% in some cases.


In the State Department instance of Opinion Space 3.0, more than 2000 different ideas were collected
(about US foreign policy). In addition, more than 5000 individual responses were gathered on this

specific issue. Moreover, the project with a US automobile industry (targeted towards recognising ways
of improving their image) resulted to about 1000 ideas generated and about 100.000 comments ratings

and evaluating these ideas (e.g. more specifically they talked about green vehicles).


One of the best endorsements regarding Opinion Space was Hillary Clinton’s reference to the initiative.
Other endorsements include testimonials from high level officers of collaborating companies as

presented in the Opinion Space website.

3.3.3 Appraisal from end users and review of experts


Although the concept, way of implementation and visualisation of the Opinion Space case is highly
innovative, the project team could consider thinking about improvement in designing the social

interaction part of Opinion Space 3.0.


In addition, it has been proposed that the Opinion Space team should argue that the net effect of the
two opposite psychological biases of the tool (premier polarization as an input, return in a depolarized

representation of individual positions as an output) is a depolarizing one. It thus needs further analysis
and consideration especially if interested to be transferred and applied in effective policy making.


Last but not least, although the up-to-date participation in the various projects engaging Opinion Space
can be considered satisfactory, the project team should build on further dissemination activities in

order to increase even more the participation of the public and reaching out to groups that are not
engaged so far. In doing this, specific topics of interest to the public and tailored dissemination

campaigns should be promoted.

3.4 UrbanSim


3.4.1 General Information

UrbanSim is a software-based demographic and development modelling tool for integrated planning

and analysis of urban development, incorporating the interactions between land use, transportation,
environment, economy and public policy with demographic information. It simulates in a 3D

environment the choices of individual households, businesses, and parcel landowners and developers,
interacting in urban real estate markets and connected by a multi-modal transportation system. The 3D

output resulting from the process underpinning the simulation model is presented using indicators,
which are variables that convey information on significant aspects of the simulation results.


This approach works with individual agents as done in agent-based modelling, and with very small cells
as in the cellular automata approach, or even at building and parcel levels. UrbanSim however differs
                                                          44
from these approaches by drawing together choice theory , a simulation of real estate markets, and
statistical methods in order to achieve accurate estimation of the necessary model parameters (such as

land policies, infrastructure choices, etc.) in order to calibrate uncertainty in its system. As an example
of its use, one could refer to the project on Modelling Land Use Change in Chittenden County , where

the model parameters based on statistical analysis of historical data are integrated with market
behaviours, land policies, infrastructure choices in order to produce simulations on household,

employment and real estate development decisions (where the first two are based on an agent-based
approach while the latter on a grid-based approach).

3.4.2 Key Highlights

UrbanSim has proved its acceptance by the targeted end users as it has been already applied in many

cases (mostly in the US), including Eugene-Springfield - Oregon, Detroit - Michigan, Salt Lake City - Utah,
San Francisco – California and Seattle – Washington. In Europe, applications of the UrbanSim system

include the cities of Brussels, Paris and Zurich. Nevertheless, UrbanSim, as still being a research
initiative, is also very active in the field of research (i.e. SustainCity FP7 project ).


In the San Francisco case, the 3D UrbanSim visualization system was created, in order to achieve higher
visibility amongst citizens than the plain UrbanSim tool. Each of the meetings conducted in this case

engaged from 15 up to 200 participants. The reason for these face to face meetings was to
communicate the different scenarios to the public and to receive feedback on the preferences of the

citizens.


UrbanSim is now exploring applications in transportation and land use domains, as well as urban
design. Environmental issues (e.g. greenhouse gas emissions) were motivation to some projects (such
                          47
as UrbanSim for Canada ); so environmental planning is also a quite relevant issue for the case. Energy
consumption and/ or water consumption constitutes issues of interest too. Modelling the impact of
climate change (e.g. on weather) is also a topic of interest. Finally, as also mentioned earlier, economic

development/ policies are also under consideration.


3.4.3 Appraisal from end users and review of experts

The UrbanSim models urge for large amounts of data; thus, it is a great challenge to locate, collect and

transform in a useful form the necessary data (e.g. statistics, demographic etc.). In addition, real estate
markets, but also transportation systems, are rather different from place to place. Thus, another

challenge is to ascertain that the UrbanSim models are flexible enough in order to fit the various needs.

In addition, given that the UrbanSim aims to further strengthen and enrich its underlying packages and

models, they should be careful in dealing with interdependencies amongst different policies (e.g.
through complex systems science). In case of such an implementation, the visualisation of the various

interdependencies would constitute a very interesting research initiative and application domain.

Moreover, UrbanSim could constitute a catalyst towards collecting, organizing and (probably most

important) enriching the globally available open/ public data. Last but not least, the UrbanSim team
should explore strengthening the initiative’s relation with social media; both as a way of identifying and

collecting data and as a way of disseminating the project to citizens and stakeholders, especially when
transferring it to different contexts, such as in Europe.

4. Cross-Analysis of the Case studies

In this section, the four cases that have been investigated in depth (i.e. 2050 Pathways Analysis,
GLEAM, Opinion Space 3.0, UrbanSim) are cross-analysed in order to compare findings and distil key
recommendations towards policy makers who embark on implementing “Policy Making 2.0” activities.





4.1 Cases Similarities and Differences
2050 Pathways Analysis, GLEAM, Opinion Space 3.0, and UrbanSim were specifically selected as they
demonstrate a well-balanced coverage of diverse policy domains, from Environment-Energy efficiency,

Health, epidemics and transportation, to Foreign Policy and Urban Planning while altogether capturing
as many research challenges under Policy Modelling and Data-powered Collaborative Governance as

possible.

Emerging from the need to solve real problems and discuss important policy domains, all cases have

been initiated either by governments or as a result of collaboration between researchers and public
administrations at different levels, mainly in a top-down approach. In particular, GLEAM and Opinion
Space 3.0 were initially introduced as research initiatives that gathered significant attention and

subsequent funding from public authorities. In fact, all cases build on a wide range of techniques that
result from research and exemplify how research can be effectively applied in real-life settings and
public policies.


Multi-disciplinarity in the teams of all cases has brought together different perspectives and ensured
appropriate modelling of policy options and interpretation of outcomes. Building a dynamic dialogue

with policy makers and all external stakeholders (NGOs, academia, industry) and specific experts, has
provided significant insights and feedback to all cases (to different extents as for example in GLEAM,

where the participation of citizens is limited). Further, the real support by public officials and experts
has been instrumental in the success of all cases.

To address the targeted needs of policy makers and citizens and allow them contribute in a more

efficient and productive way to the policy issues at stake, dedicated tools have been developed in each
case study. Simple interfaces (like gaming environments in the 2050 Pathways Analysis, or interactive

visualizations in GLEAM, Opinion Space 3.0, and UrbanSim) have proved effective in engaging and
keeping the interest of people without a specific case-related background (such as in simulation,
modelling, etc.) and have been strongly endorsed in practically all cases. Through the visual interfaces,

users (either citizens or policy makers) are in a position to create their own models and investigate
specific issues that they are interested in. The teams involved in all cases were indeed faced with a

trade-off between usability and sophistication, with the constraint of a cut-off point beyond which
further simplification would become unacceptable in terms of accuracy. Naturally, in each case, the
required learning curve to understand and use a policy model significantly varies (and it depends on the

complexity of the policy model(s) running in the background for being used effectively by policy
makers).

                                   0313F02_Case studies on specific applications of ICT solutions for policy modelling




In all cases, the power of high-quality data at an appropriate level and format to be incorporated into

policy models is indisputable. Open data have been exploited to a certain extent in the case of 2050
Pathways Analysis and GLEAM. In Opinion Space 3.0, the necessary data are in effect provided by the

users and policy makers. UrbanSim and GLEAM also take stock of proprietary data that had acquisition
cost and limitations in their distribution.

Despite recognizing the network effect of social media and Web2.0 technologies, the four cases
confirm that their use for the policy-making domain is often accompanied by some scepticism or too

much enthusiasm. Interaction with social media is limited to publishing relevant stories in the user’s
social media accounts while a more efficient exploitation of social data is envisaged as crucial for future

research in most of the cases studied.

Funding has also been a non-negligible factor for keeping the cases alive since various additional
functionalities and components have been gradually introduced in the course of each case’s life span.

All cases have succeeded in informing policy makers and citizens in a documented manner. However,

the use of policy models seems rather diverse, focusing at different abstraction levels and ranging from
elaborate stochastic models (in GLEAM and UrbanSim) to more lightweight models (that can be

depicted in simple spreadsheets like in 2050 Pathways Analysis). As anticipated, behind each model,
there are assumptions, modelling compromises, incomplete/ missing data, etc. so looking at solely the

numbers is not sufficient. The role of policy makers and field-experts (acting e.g. as advisors and
consultants) indeed remains crucial across the procedure on embedding the models into governance
and policy making.


To measure impact, typically, no specific Key Performance Indicator (KPIs) were set from the inception
of the cases which can be acknowledged as a recurring problem in policy making in general. However,

the numbers of visitors and of interactions have demonstrated their success and impact, which has
been reinforced with the help of appropriate stakeholders’ engagement strategies. It needs to be noted

that in some cases (GLEAM) users resorted to the corresponding platform as a result of a natural
phenomenon (i.e. H1N1 pandemic) whereas in others (Opinion Space 3.0 and 2050 Pathways Analysis),
it was the outcome of large press coverage that demonstrated the value of the cases.


By studying cases that had strong internalization aspects (i.e. transferring experience from national to
international level in 2050 Pathways Analysis, from US to EU in UrbanSim), the difference in socio-

cultural dimensions emerges and should not be neglected as it may decide the success of a case in
applying it to different geographic settings and socio-technical landscapes.

4.2 Policy Implications: the “Decalogue of Policy Making 2.0”

On the basis of the analysis of the experience of the four cases studied and reflected in the interaction
with their stakeholders, a set of policy implications were derived. Such implications have been

formulated into concrete recommendations (defined as the “Decalogue of Policy Making 2.0”) that
should be taken into account by policy makers and stakeholders when initiating similar endeavours.


This set of recommendations is addressed not only to policy makers, but also to modellers,
practitioners, researchers and policy making 2.0 case development teams, which should all work
together in a collaborative manner towards delivering effective applications and methodologies to

advance the use of ICT solutions for better governance and policy making.

With this audience in mind, the report presents the complete set of recommendations characterized as

the “Decalogue of Policy Making 2.0” as it aims at infusing a very practical and applicable approach to
all stakeholders that needs to be involved in such process. It is crucial for all of them to understand and

acknowledge all recommendations for a complete case, even if some of them refer to specific actors
and not to the overall set of stakeholders. Such a mutual understanding will allow fruitful
collaborations in the future and more result-oriented activities, where all parties will be able to

comprehend the requirements and the work carried out by each involved actor.

As such, the recommendations that are presented below are also classified:

       Based on the stakeholder groups they refer to, which are:

           o   Policy Makers
           o   Modellers
           o   Researchers

       Based on their scope regarding the overall case development that can be divided in the

        following steps/phases
           o   Business Model and Strategy definition of the case
           o   Implementation and Technology Aspects

           o   Engagement of Stakeholders




The set of policy recommendations is depicted in Figure 4 below.

As described above, the figure presents the recommendations oriented towards multiple stakeholders

(ranging from Policy Makers, to Modellers and Researchers) and classified based upon their scope
according to the Business model and strategy issues that should be addressed, the Implementation and
Technology aspects that should underlying it, and finally the ways that the Engagement of the various

stakeholders should be achieved.

The Policy Recommendations forming altogether the “Decalogue of Policy Making 2.0” are described

in details here below.

Policy Recommendation 1. Build your case in Policy Making 2.0 in an agile manner.


Capitalizing on the experiences gained in the Web 2.0 domain, cases in Policy Making 2.0 should follow
the agile pattern for implementing light-applications with constant, iterative cycles of design,

development and testing. Since building a generic model to cover all aspects is impossible and
specialization in certain domains and application of already established knowledge is the most

recommended way to go, platforms/ apps and their accompanying policy models should be gradually
developed incorporating feedback received by the users in each major and minor release.

Policy Recommendation 2. Continuously embed high-quality (open) data into your policy models.


No matter how well-defined or detailed a policy model is, high-quality data represent the holy grail of
policy making. Particular attention thus needs to be given to collect, filter, curate and intelligently tap

bottom-up data, available from multiple sources (i.e. through open data initiatives, social media and
participatory sensing tools, or even data gathered for commercial purposes). As current policy making
cases typically struggle to cope with too much or too little data at the appropriate level (i.e. in terms of

dimensionality and time-variance), reliable data sources need to be foreseen from the very beginning
and incorporated in policy models in a real-time manner to allow for pragmatically informed decisions.

Policy Recommendation 3. Tap the power of visualization and social networks to effectively
communicate policy outcomes.

Policy models typically hinder such a high level of complexity that tends to discourage stakeholders

from contributing or even trying to understand the policy issue at stake. In essence, visualization holds
the promise of providing valuable insights to non-specialists and explaining the more complex

principles that drive and influence policies, while social networks provide an unprecedented
opportunity for spreading knowledge. By taking the best of breed out of both research streams, a case

is by-design more tuned to solicit concrete inputs from its stakeholders.

Policy Recommendation 4. Invest on real-time simulation technologies.

In a rapidly moving world, the importance of real-time data and simulation for quick decisions gains

more and more momentum. To this end, it is necessary for a case not only to gather real-time data, but
to allow for the direct experimentation with the policy models to anticipate the outcomes of various

policy alternatives. Only through advanced simulation capabilities, different models can be calibrated at
a satisfactory degree and eventually converge to suggesting best policy options and alternatives.

Policy Recommendation 5. Create intuitive, yet diverse interfaces depending on the profile of the

stakeholders.

Policy models by their nature depict part of the reality as conceived by policy makers and interpreted

by policy modellers. In order to bridge the gap of modelling literacy, though, all stakeholders
irrespectively of their background need to understand the effect of their own actions on the results of
models. Finding the balance between the complexity required for policy making purposes and the

simplicity needed to ensure high engagement is always a challenging task. In this respect, intuitive user
interfaces (which are also accessible from multiple devices and platforms) in order to engage a wide

range of stakeholders (policy modellers, policy makers and citizens) seem a crucial success factor.

Policy Recommendation 6. Bring together multi-disciplinary expertise.

The need for multi-disciplinary approaches in policy making has been long debated. With policy

challenges that are both global in nature and local in required action, it is more necessary that ever to
bring in a wide range of expertise that will not only construct a solid and close to reality model, but also

interpret the results correctly and catch the realm of citizens and policy makers needs.

It needs to be noted that such expertise should emerge from researchers, practitioners, policy makers,

NGOs and other stakeholders who are motivated to be heavily involved. Significant added value is
attached to a case in Policy Making 2.0 by establishing a balance between research activities and real-
life applications to constantly improve the actual impact of the ICT tools and underlying models.

Policy Recommendation 7. Engage stakeholders from the very beginning.

In order to consider a case in Policy Making 2.0 as successful, a wide range of stakeholders needs to be
involved at various engagement levels: from active, everyday participation to merely briefing. Opening

up dialogue with all stakeholders is a time consuming task that should not be underestimated. To this
end, an engagement strategy with targeted activities for each stakeholder group needs to be outlined

and put into effect from the very beginning, although it might seem difficult when dealing with pure
research concepts. Successful cases get known one way or another via word of mouth/ Web2.0 and

satisfied users, high level testimonials, especially policy makers, are the best ambassadors of a case.

Policy Recommendation 8. Incubate your case into the interested public organization.

Typically, research is conducted in sort of “sterilized” laboratory environments with little interaction

with the end-users. In the case of Policy Making 2.0, research needs to go hand-in-hand with practice in
order to allow for quick implementation of ideas in real-life settings. Along these lines, research teams

should incubate in public organizations with a policy agenda in order to ensure smooth communication
and seamless advancement of research through its direct application to policy issues and practical
needs.


Such an approach will also help research teams to validate their assumptions based on real-life data
while policy makers will be able to propose requirements, as captured during implementation, which

will help to further optimise the offered solutions. Public organisations should thus build specialised
teams within their structure that will consist of both policy experts and researchers that have

developed the offered solutions in order to exploit the full potential of the offered tools and to connect
practice with research.

Policy Recommendation 9. Treat your case as a product/ service to ensure sustainability and further
development.


Following the paradigm of enterprise software (i.e. ERP or CRM) and services, cases in Policy Making
2.0 should be viewed under a long-term perspective for their target audience and potential users,

especially policy makers. They should not represent a one-off effort that may become obsolete and
easily deprecated, but rather embody the commitment of the corresponding public organization to

keep the initiative live through periodic funding injections.

By treating a case as a service/product, the interest of the research and stakeholder community can be

more effectively maintained, the underlying models can be further elaborated and optimised and the
sustainability of the offered solution can be maintained in a more proper and effective manner. Of
course, alternative sources of funding should be also identified. At the bottom line, policy makers

should realise that Policy Making 2.0 cases, in other ICT domain (such as Social Media), possess a ROI
that cannot be measured and witnessed directly, however benefits do exist and they can only be

sustained by the proper funding instruments.

Policy Recommendation 10. Think out-of-the box for the deployment of your case in other settings
and contexts.


The team responsible for a case in Policy Making 2.0 should keep its horizons open and ensure its
maximum outreach both within and beyond the organization for which it was originally developed.

Interaction with stakeholders from different domains may pave new directions for the application of a
case and cover diverse needs of policy makers that had not been originally foreseen. As such it is

important to spread the knowledge and the overall experience of a case with as many stakeholders as
possible in order to trigger their eagerness and explore new directions for application that may lie

ahead.

5. Enhancing the CROSSOVER Roadmap on Policy Making 2.0


5.1 Reflections of the Case Studies towards the CROSSOVER roadmap
For the very beginning of this analysis, the effort has been to select a set of cases that shall cover as

many of the steps of the policy making cycle as possible (i.e. Agenda Setting, Design, Implementation,
Monitor and Evaluation) and this has been also reflected in the criteria for the selection of the cases

and their analysis.

The following table presents the coverage of the policy making cycle by the investigated cases, as

indicated by the people engaged in the creation and management of the cases themselves*.

                               Final Cases
                                               2050      GLEAM       Opinion    UrbanSim

*X’s marks the answers retrieved directly for the responsible team of each case, while @’s mark potential

usage as envisaged during the analysis

As shown in the table above, according to the cases' managers interviewed, most of the cases selected

target the “Design” of policies, while there is a limited coverage of the “Agenda Setting” and the
“Implementation” and “Monitor and Evaluation” phases.


However, it has to be noted that some of these cases could potentially cover also the last step of the
policy making cycle (i.e. “Monitor and Evaluation”), but they are currently not used for that purpose.

However, some of their characteristics (such as the “real-time data input” of the GLEAM model) could
be implemented to actively monitor and evaluate the success rate and other factors of different
policies that are already in place. It is possible that existing methodologies and tools can be applied to

other fields or with other purposes and still deliver useful results that could assist policy makers.

This is also a natural consequence of the set of key challenges that policy makers are facing today which
                                                              48
have been identified by the CROSSOVER's Roadmap as the following :


      The need to detect and understand problems before they become unsolvable.
      The generation of the necessary preconditions for high involvement of all stakeholders and
       especially citizens in policy making.

      The identification of “good ideas” and innovative solutions to long-standing problems (by
       bringing the wisdom of the crowd).

   Policy Modelling - Interim Version

       The reduction of uncertainty on the possible impacts of policies.




The above mentioned key challenges reveal the emphasis that policy makers put (or should put) on
proactive activities that could benefit policy making as one of their major concerns is that of delivering

high quality, evidence-based and impact oriented policies and not perform trials on real conditions. As
such, the “Design” phase seems to prevail over the others when it comes to tools that are mostly

desired by policy makers, as this is the point where they can easily and without harm experiment with
the various options they have for policies to be formulated.

In other words, the “Design” phase is the actual “trial&fail” or “trial&succeed” testbed, during which

policy makers are able to both explore their options and seek for the ex-ante assessment of the policies
under consideration from the citizen’s perspective.


Departing from this step means that most decisions have been already taken and then the emphasis is
laid on the implementation of policies. The major concern during the “Implementation” phase is that of

increasing the acceptance, the understanding and the collaboration between the decision makers and
the citizens based on already deployed terms, and of course on the monitoring and evaluation of the
interventions implemented. However, it should be note that the improved collaboration is handled by

tools and methods that focus on the communication and conveyance of messages that will help the
smooth implementation of a policy, an area that deals with communication strategies and which does

not belong to the “core” Policy Making 2.0 methods and tools, but finds a close relation with them.

Moreover, when examining the last step of the policy making cycle, that of “Monitor and Evaluation”,

where decision makers get informed about the impact of the already deployed policies, one can
identify only few ICT-based tools and methods that are really having an impact and engage fruitfully
with stakeholders and citizens. Of course there are many discussion tools, like forums and blogs,

however for the purpose of the current research such tools have been considered as not suitable as
they have been already experimented by policy makers, but so far with many limitations and

constraints.

The same also applies for the “Agenda Setting” step, as there is an absence of new ways to massively

engage citizens during the early procedures that lie before the actual design phase. The majority of
tools used have been around since many years now, and in some cases are re-furbished with some new
tweaks and upgraded features that try to infuse some Web2.0 and other characteristics. Crowdsourcing

seems to fit very well this stage, as it can be used to address issues selected in a top-down fashion (by
policy makers themselves). But again, the impact of such experiments remains anecdotal and the

results are not embedded in policy-making, at least for the cases analysed..

Regarding the various tools and methods that are being used in the different steps of the policy making

cycle, it needs to be mentioned that the four cases selected for the analysis, as emerging from the
methodological approach followed, capture a broad spectrum of the research challenges of the
CROSSOVER roadmap on ICT tools for Governance and Policy Modelling. The relation of the cases to

the research challenges (as extracted from CROSSOVER deliverable D2.2.1 - International Research

Based on the previous table, the four cases investigated are not focusing only on one specific research

challenge. This is obvious in many of the other cases reviewed during the analysis. Tools and methods
are in fact most commonly built in order to address specific issues and not specific phases of the policy

making cycle, while an orientation towards just a sole research challenge would have turned each case
to a very specific tool that would be usable only by a very small group of stakeholders.

Such an approach would also result into acquiring important data which would then need further

specialised tools to be processed, interpreted and carried on forward towards transforming it to highly
usable information for policy making.


As a result – and this usually constitutes the “winning argument” of these cases – they are not focused
on solving isolated issues but try to cover a wider spectrum of issues, employing a large set of tools and
methods available, though in some cases (e.g. GLEAM) a specific policy issue is addressed. This need is

a natural outcome of the high complexity of the problems that policy makers have to tackle, and as
these call for multi-disciplinarity in research and development, it is clear that this can only be achieved

by combining different tools, practices and scientific disciplines.




At this point it has to be mentioned that the four cases analysed did not show any evidence of
technologies or methodologies that fall under the “Participatory Sensing” and “Identity Management”

research challenges of the CROSSOVER's Roadmap. The main reasons behind this fact are multiple and

some insights are presented in the following sections.

The analysis of the case studies has also revealed which research areas are met in each step of the

policy making cycle. The result of this exercise is presented in the following table, which combines
Tables 4 and 5.


Again, this table is derived from the results of the analysis of the four cases solely, and thus should not
be viewed as a generic perception of the overall domain, but rather reveals the information extracted
from the cases under investigation. However it could serve as a starting point for further research and

generalisation in order to effectively link the different research challenges with the policy making cycle.

5.2 Practical Recommendations for the CROSSOVER Roadmap

Based on the analyses performed during the in-depth investigation of case studies, a short list of high-
level recommendations to be used to further enhance the CROSSOVER Roadmap in its final version has

been developed.




Roadmap Recommendation 1. Think of the Roadmap’s Elements as Nodes in a Connected Graph

Highly complex environments have a unique characteristic: the elements they include are related and

linked to each other based on various types of relationships. The analysis presented in Table 5 has led
to the creation of a graph revealing the relations between the different research challenges as listed in

the draft CROSSOVER Roadmap on Policy Making 2.0 (Figure 5 below).

The graph contains in blue all the Research Challenges deriving from the 1 Grand Challenge “Policy
                                                       nd
Modelling”, while the orange ones come from the 2         Grand Challenge “Data-powered Collaborative
Governance”. The edges between the different nodes represent the relationships between the

different research challenges, as documented in the four cases under investigation, as a result of
finding the relations between the different columns of Table 5 that belong either to the 1 Grand  st
                                 nd
Challenge (rows 3-8) or to the 2 (rows 10-17). For example, in the case of GLEAM and when isolating
the sets of research challenges that belong to the different Grand Challenges, one could see that

“Collaborative Modelling” is connected to “Immersive Simulation”, and “Open Government Data” is
connected to “Visual Analytics”.


However, as practice has shown, the two Grand Challenges are not isolated sets of research elements,
as many connections between their elements exist. The green dotted edges reveal these relationships

between the research challenges of the two grand challenges. Having GLEAM as an example again, one
could see that it includes both “Open Government Data” and “Collaborative Modelling”, so the green

dotted edge represents the evidence of such a relationship.

The thickness of the edges reveals the number of relationships identified in the four cases (see

Roadmap Recommendation #2).

As figure 5 shows, there are many relations between the different research areas of Policy Making 2.0,

even when looking at a very small (but with a wide span) specimen, such as the 4 cases analysed in the
study. In fact, as it was already made evident in the previous sections, research and development

during each case analysed focused in more than one research challenge as it aimed to solve specific
problems which are by nature multi-disciplinary. Such a behaviour seems natural as Policy Making 2.0 is

a domain that contains diverse research fields that should however be combined and tackled in parallel
in order to deliver working and usable applications and methodologies that could support the policy

making process.




This is also a need that derives directly from the fact that such applications target many different


                                               Page 41 of 180
                                   0313F02_Case studies on specific applications of ICT solutions for policy modelling




stakeholder groups, with diverse backgrounds and thus it is necessary to combine different parts of the

identified research challenges in an effective manner.

































                     Figure 4: The Graph of Policy Making 2.0 Research Challenges



Looking at the graph, only the research challenges “Participatory Sensing” and “Identity Management”
have not been identified in the four cases and therefore are not connected to the graph in the same
manner as all other research challenges.


However, during discussion with experts and reviewers, it has been decided to link “Participatory
Sensing” to “Big Data” as it obviously sits on top of it and the two have very close relations. Thus this

edge is coloured black in order to show the difference with the relationships that have been extracted
from the analysis. On the other hand “Identity Management” remains disconnected, though this does

not mean it should be removed from the Roadmap or that it is a not important element of it (see
Roadmap Recommendation #2 for further comments on this).











                                                Page 42 of 180
                                  0313F02_Case studies on specific applications of ICT solutions for policy modelling




Roadmap Recommendation 2. Build Clusters of Research Challenges and Define Policy Making

“Enablers”

The graph presented in Figure 5 also reveals which specific areas have stronger bonds between each

other by observing the thickness of the edges that represent how many times the relation between two
nodes has been witnessed in the four cases analysed. For example, the link between “Big Data” and
“Visual Analytics” has been witnessed three times in the sample of the four representative cases, while

“Systems of Atomized Models” is present only once in a case which also included “Immersive
Simulation”.


Based on the findings of the four case studies, it seems that the research challenges “Collaborative
Modelling”, “Immersive Simulation”, “Output Analysis and Knowledge Synthesis”, “Open Government

Data”, “Big Data” and “Visual Analytics” are met more times than the rest. This could lead to the
creation of different clusters around them, as they seem to be quite dominant and present in most
cases.


As mentioned before, there exist numerous links between the various research challenges of the two
Grand Challenges (and they seem stronger between the research challenges “Immersive Simulation”-

“Big Data” and “Collaborative Modelling”-“Visual Analytics”-“Open Government Data”. This should be
considered alongside the Roadmap Recommendation #1 in order to construct clusters of research

challenges that could lead to more applied research in order to advance quicker from purely theoretical
investigation of specific issues to the development of real life applications and methodologies. In such a
context, the roadmap could point out clusters that not only include elements from one Grand

Challenge, but also combine multidisciplinary elements that are required towards developing successful
policy making applications and cases.


Based on the results of the analysis and on the number of edges observed in the graph of Figure 5, it
seems that a possible re-ordering of the research challenges could also be of benefit, especially in case

this graph is further populated by findings of other cases towards a more generic image of the relations
between the nodes. However, from the preliminary work that has been conducted based on the
analysis of the four cases, one might argue that some research challenges (like for example

“Collaborative Modelling”) sit on top of others and can be seen as supersets of other challenges.

Furthermore, as already mentioned above, the study also reveals that the Research Challenge “Identity

Management” seems disconnected from the other Research Challenges (and this has been also evident
in the long list of the cases analysed as part of this research: see Annexes). Thus it could seem at first

sight not finding a place amongst the other research challenges of the Roadmap. However, as this is a
very important area and a prerequisite for many eGovernment and Policy Making applications, it is
suggested to be treated as a “Policy Making” enabler. Thus, it is proposed to complement the Research

Roadmap with a set of Policy Making “Enablers”.

Policy Making “Enablers” can be seen as bits of supportive technologies and methodologies that can be

directly exported from neighbouring domains and could be used to support the creation of applications
and Policy Making 2.0 tools. These include elements from domains such as Identity Management, Cloud

Computing, Social Media, Mobile Technologies, Human Computer Interaction, etc. that are being

                                              Page 43 of 180
                                   0313F02_Case studies on specific applications of ICT solutions for policy modelling





thoroughly researched and have already delivered quite substantial results. In this context, Policy
Making 2.0 should identify the best-of-breed solutions coming from these domains and directly
introduce them to existing or under development cases in order to refrain from re-inventing the wheel,

but focusing on the research topics and themes that are more relevant to the policy making cycle and
to the decision procedures that need to be improved. To this extent, the cross-checking of the existing

research questions and issues underlying the various challenges identified by the Roadmap with a well-
defined and structured taxonomy documenting the current knowledge of the domain and of

neighbouring ones should take place.




Roadmap Recommendation 3. Promote Shift from Gov Labs to Open Apps

One of the fundamental characteristics of Policy Making 2.0 is the inclusion of citizens in the decision

making process through their interaction with the government facilitated by various tools. Of course,
the direct engagement of the whole of society on every aspect of policy making is not possible (and to

many also not desirable). Although many citizens have skills that allow them to utilise the various tools
and methods under investigation, most of these tools are too complicated to be used by many groups

of the population in most countries in the world. This is quite evident and it is one of the main issues
behind the lock-up situation of Policy Making 2.0 in a top-down approach, where a clearly bottom-up

(crowdsourced based) approach that is actively being exploited and used by policy makers is still
lacking.

                         49
As the “magic quadrant” developed building on the analysis of case studies and presented in Figure 6
shows, the current landscape of Policy Making 2.0 research challenges could be divided in four spaces:


       “Gov Labs” where applications are still highly experimental and they are only addressed (or can
        be used) by policy experts,
       “Gov Farms” where again policy experts are the users but applications and tools are already in

        a highly mature and operational state,
       “Open Labs” where direct engagement of citizens is quite high but applications are yet
        experimental, and finally
       “Open Apps” where there exist at the same time high engagement of citizens and maturity of

        applications to be used for policy making and other decision making purposes.

It should be mentioned that, differently from most 'magic quadrants' the Policy Making 2.0 magic

quadrant developed does not contain tools, but the research challenges as identified by the
CROSSOVER research roadmap. Its purpose is to act as a “sample” of the current Policy Making 2.0
landscape, and therefore the placement of the research challenges represents the “median” value of

the actual placement on this 2D area of the elements/tools/technologies/methodologies they include.

                   Figure 5: Magic Quadrant of Policy Making 2.0 Research Challenges


As Figure 6 shows, most of the research challenges that involve the direct engagement of citizens are
still considered as quite immature, and this also argues for their lower utilisation and verifies their

importance for the research roadmap. At the same time, the research challenges that at the moment
do not engage citizens in a direct manner, are considered more mature, however they have just passed

the infancy years and results of their utilisation and impact on the policy making process is still to be
proved or it is becoming evident only since the last few years.


Therefore, although these are considered as more “ready-to-use” applications, research is still required
in order to implement further and integrate them in the everyday activities of policy makers. Further
research is required also to enhance their social characteristics so that they could eventually engage

citizens in a more direct and fruitful way.

Roadmap Recommendation 4. Define the Timing Horizon for Research


A final practical recommendation for the CROSSOVER roadmap, which is generated as a consequence
of the analysis of the four case studies and as indirect implication of the previous roadmap
recommendations (e.g. CROSSROAD) is that all research challenges should be clearly accompanied by a

time horizon. Such a horizon shall focus research and policy efforts towards achieving measurable and
quantifiable results in a given time frame.

                                                                    50
Figure 7 below presents a conceptual hype curve (or hype cycle) regarding the research challenges
identified in the CROSSOVER roadmap. This hype curve is based on information that derives from:


       current ICT trends (in general) and of the Policy Modelling domain in particular
       views that have been recorded during the interviews that took place during the study. This was

        possible as the interviewed people elaborated their thoughts on the future research activities
        regarding their case, the desirable improvements and the potential extensions in terms of
        utilisation and exploitation of emerging or existing technologies and methodologies over an
        horizon of the upcoming 10 years.


One should consider that the placement of each research challenge on the curve has been performed
having in mind both the mature and the immature sub-areas it contains. In general, the position of the

different research challenges on the curve in Figure 7 is in accordance with their maturity level as
presented in 6. As a result, an indicative timeframe for research can be drawn, grouping research

challenges into those that are considered:

       more mature and could deliver concrete results in a short term horizon of no more than 3

        years,
       on the verge of maturity and could produce results within 3 to 5 years of research and

       still in infancy and require more intense and long-lasting research efforts, putting their major
        concrete contribution to the domain of Policy Making 2.0 in a timeframe that lies 5 to 10 years

        ahead from today.

                      Figure 6: Policy Making 2.0 Research Challenges Hype Curve



Based on the previous recommendations, it has to be noted that the timeline presented in Figure 7 is
neither fixed, nor it represents the complete image of the domain. It is based mainly on the findings of
the analysis of the four cases investigated in-depth and therefore further analysis, including the

opinions of experts in all these fields are required in order to adjust the placement of these research
challenges on the hype curve and so defining their degree of possible deployment and maturity.


Although the cases analysed are considered representative enough of the Policy Making 2.0 domain,
further investigation of other cases and exploration of the links between the various research

challenges is needed in order to optimise the time horizon for future research and policy proposals.
Moreover, a cross analysis of the proposed timelines, of the graph relationships of the research

challenges and of their position regarding their maturity and engagement of citizens is necessary in
order to derive more precise recommendations to be included into the final roadmap on Policy Making
2.0 so to possibly reveal well-coordinated mechanisms for exploiting the potential of the domain in the

most timely and efficient way.

6. Conclusions

As presented in the initial sections of this report, the research conducted has reviewed and analysed a
long list of existing cases in the domain of Policy Making 2.0 and after choosing a representative set of
4   cases    which    cover    a   wide    spectrum     of   policy-making    steps,   domains     and

methodologies/technologies/tools, proceeded to a deeper analysis that was able to shed light to
important dimensions that have been analysed for being considered to be integrated into the
CROSSOVER roadmap on Policy Making 2.0.


The recommendations set out in this report, which are the direct outcome of the activities of in-depth
analysis of case studies and the work of mapping and identification of promising cases, are aligned with

the nature of the Policy Making 2.0 domain, which calls for more open, collaborative and evidence-
based decisions. These needs are still not fully covered, as the analysis conducted reveals that many of

these prerequisites are still missing even after several years of research and deployment. Seamless
access to information and data, preferably following an open and cost effective approaches are still
lacking, while public agencies are over-protective and reluctant to the idea of sharing their data and

other datasets are too expensive to be used by research teams. At the same time, policy makers are
still treating emerging cases as “freeware” products and are not investing in their further development,

nor in the necessary staff which possess the required background to turn the potential of these tools to
digestible facts and figures for policy makers. Moreover, there is still confusion about which tools are of
direct interest for policy makers and which can be used by potentially all citizens, while almost all

research efforts follow a top-down approach, neglecting the fact that open innovation and
crowdsourcing is gaining a tremendous momentum in the current Web2.0 era.


This analysis ends up with two sets of recommendations addressed both to policy makers and to
practitioners/researchers active in the Policy Making 2.0 domain. The first set of recommendations that
have been generated by analysing and identifying these issues deals with the presentation of policy

implications as captured by the analysis and the interviews conducted with people involved in the
various cases identified. Those are summarised in the 'Decalogue of policy Making 2.0' as follows:


    P.R.#1.     Build your case in Policy Making 2.0 in an agile manner.
    P.R.#2.     Continuously embed high-quality (open) data into your policy models.
    P.R.#3.     Tap the power of visualization and social networks to effectively communicate policy
                outcomes.
    P.R.#4.     Invest on real-time simulation technologies.

    P.R.#5.     Create intuitive, yet diverse interfaces depending on the profile of the stakeholders.
    P.R.#6.     Bring together multi-disciplinary expertise.
    P.R.#7.     Engage stakeholders from the very beginning.
    P.R.#8.     Incubate your case into the interested public organization.

    P.R.#9.     Treat your case as a product/service to ensure sustainability and further development.
    P.R.#10.    Think out-of-the box for the deployment of your case in other settings and contexts.





The second set of recommendations aims to provide the necessary input in order to complement and

further enhance the CROSSOVER Roadmap on Policy making 2.0, based on the reflections of the

findings gathered and the in-depth analysis of the four cases on the emerging results of the
roadmapping exercise.


Those are the summarised by the following:

    R.R.#1.     Think of the Roadmap’s Elements as Nodes in a Connected Graph
    R.R.#2.     Build Clusters of Research Challenges and Define Policy Making “Enablers”

    R.R.#3.     Shift from Gov Labs to Open Apps
    R.R.#4.     Define the Timing Horizon for Research



These recommendations are the main conclusions of the in-depth analysis of selected case studies and
could be used (possibly upon further validation with other cases and by the community of experts,
practitioners, researchers and policy makers involved in the Policy Making 2.0 debate) for the

enrichment of the final version of the CROSSOVER Roadmap on Policy Making 2.0.

Despite the impact and the benefits for both researchers and policy makers that the roadmap will

bring, it is inarguable that even more than 5 years after the launch of this research priority as part of
the EC FP7 work programme, these communities are "not yet there" when it comes to fully exploiting

the benefits of ICT for governance and policy-making and interweaving ICT within the policy-making
processes and in support of various public policies.


In fact, one of the main reasons for designing a roadmap for research, policy and practice is to deal with
this reality. It is difficult to deny that there is an urgent need for better policy-making to drive Europe
out of its current crisis contributing towards the achievement of the objectives of the Europe 2020

strategy; at the same time there is still a considerable gap between the potential and the real impact of
ICT tools in support of governance and policy-making.


The CROSSOVER roadmap should put in perspective important missing pieces of the puzzle of the Policy
Making 2.0 domain. However, with a view to Horizon 2020, further coordination activities are needed
to help accelerate the transition of this important domain from its present and promising status, in

which it has been stuck for too long, to a really useful, impact-oriented and beneficial one, especially
for the younger generation which strives to engage into the decision making processes both at the

European and global level.

The UK Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) built the 2050 Calculator to help the public
engage in the debate, and for Government to ensure that its short- and medium-term planning was
consistent with achieving the long-term aim. More specifically, as the UK is committed to reducing its

greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% by 2050, relative to 1990 levels, a transformation of the UK
economy is needed while ensuring secure, low carbon energy supplies to 2050, and face major choices
about how to do this. In the Carbon Plan published in December 2011, the Calculator was used to

illustrate three 2050 futures that show some of the plausible routes towards meeting the target.

The 2050 Pathways Analysis features four resources:

    1. A web-based tool for the public to try their own ideas for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

    2. An in depth Excel-based tool and reporting system which includes the methodology/the models
       that are used for the analysis.
    3. A web-based presentation for younger audiences about greenhouse gas emissions.
    4. A toolkit for leading an energy debate in schools.



The 2050 Calculator is targeted at citizens, policy makers, senior officials and politicians as well as
technical experts through different interfaces.

The 2050 Pathways presents a framework through which it is possible to consider some of the choices

and trade-offs we will have to make over the next forty years. It is system-wide, covering all parts of the
economy and all greenhouse gases emissions released in the UK. It is rooted in scientific and

engineering realities, looking at what is thought to be physically and technically possible in each
sector.51


2050 pathways is a tool to help policy makers, the energy industry and the public understand these
choices. For each sector of the economy, four alternative trajectories have been developed, ranging

from little or no effort to reduce emissions or save energy (level 1) to extremely ambitious changes that

push towards the physical or technical limits of what can be achieved (level 4).

The 2050 Pathways Calculator – available on the DECC website - allows users to develop their own

combination of levels of change to achieve an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050,
while ensuring that energy supply meets demand.    52


The supportive tools of the initiative provide different ways of securing a low-carbon future for the UK

and they can be tried out:

       By creating each user’s own pathway using the 2050 Web Tool.

       By exploring what a low-carbon UK might look like in 2050 by playing the simplified My2050
        simulation.

       By taking the debate into the classroom in the schools toolkit.

The procedure that 2050 Pathways follows in order to perform the aforementioned analysis can be

found in the following figure:

A1.2 Case Motivation and Deployment


The 2050 Pathways project was initiated in the summer of 2009. At that time, the UK Department of

Energy and Climate Change (DECC) was newly formed and tried to formulate its first white paper. The
department had at that time to work towards some initially set targets (e.g. reduce greenhouse gas

emissions by at least 80% by 2050), without having concrete answers on whether this objective was
possible or the way this target could be achieved due to lack of data and appropriate models. This need

sparked the idea for a brand new initiative - the 2050 Calculator.
                                                                                    53
The DECC already had in hand various analytical models (such as MarkAl ) that could be used;

however, these models were really complicated and hard to use. In addition, decision makers were
doubtful on which model was the proper one to use, especially when two (or more) alternative models

gave different answers on the same questions. As a result of that, the department decided that a
different, new kind of model was needed in order to be fast, transparent, stable and effective. Thus,
                                                                                                 54
this was a fine opportunity for the 2050 Pathways project to start. The DECC White Paper had close
attention of various administrations (e.g. Secretary of State, Permanent Secretary, Director-Generals,

Director of Strategy). In addition, the chief scientific advisor of the department at that time, Professor

David MacKay, was really keen on this piece of work and was really found of an idea like the 2050

Calculator.



























                         Figure A-2: Playing the My2050 Game for the demand side

In a fully operational (with Excel model and user-friendly web tool) model, the project was available in
2010. The tool was updated twice in 2011, including launching the Game version My2050.

Concerning the deployment, there were lots of involved stakeholders. There was a core team (6-10

people) of the DECC (who were leading the work), people from other governmental departments (e.g.
transport, industry department) and probably hundreds of external stakeholders (from NGOs,

academia, industry, experts). All the needed development was based in collaboration with various
actors. Indicative categories of the actual effort included:

       6-10 persons for the first phase, about a year (designing and building the model)
       Searching and collecting the necessary information

       Call for evidence (6 people for 7 months)
       Adding costs analysis (4 people for 9 months)
       Maintaining and improving model (4 people)
       International and UK engagement work (4 people)

The various stakeholders were also involved in the deployment of the project, in two distinguished, yet

interdependent, phases:

       The building phase, which included modellers, peer reviewers of the numbers that were used
       The running phase

Regarding the funding sources, the project was initiated and initially funded by the DECC. Small parts of
extra funding were occasionally found from other sources (e.g. a public engagement organization

helped to fund the My2050 game (53.000 pounds)). More recently, two million pounds were provided

                                             Page 53 of 180
                                    0313F02_Case studies on specific applications of ICT solutions for policy modelling





by the International Climate Fund so as to help promote the 2050 Pathways initiative in 10 developing

countries (besides the UK).

As far as the CROSSOVER Policy Cycle is concerned, the project probably fits in the first step, this of

Agenda Setting. This is due to the fact that the concept is a high-level one (e.g. reduce gas emissions to
80% by 2050). As the data are currently being updated and a comparison between the projected and

the actual results will take place, probably the case could in the near future fit into the Monitor and
Evaluation Policy Cycle step as well.




A1.3 Implementation


The implementation of the project was itself a pretty challenging task. As a first step, an experienced/
lead modeller (using the most recent version of MS Excel) was engaged in order to fulfil the demanding
                                                                                                  56
task of modelling the necessary components. The overall 2050 Pathways Analysis model                was build

using MS Excel (so MS Excel was used as the modelling tool) which parsed different functions and
numbers in order to provide the final results of the model.

In addition, a project management team was needed in order to put all the stakeholders together and

coordinate the whole work. Moreover, experts were engaged in a role of a “team leader”, coordinating
the work in individual teams that dealt with specific issues. A partner with Web2.0 and programming

experience was also involved.

Other necessary intangible “components” of the project’s implementation were objectivity, diplomacy,

transparency, collaboration and understanding.

The main model of the case is based on a spreadsheet. The project uses mostly open source software,
which was a strategic decision of the project team. In addition, the platform provides the end user with

the ability to comment and make propositions for ameliorating the platform and the whole concept.
There is also integration with social media: the platform gives the end user the opportunity to share
his/ her Pathway to Facebook and Twitter.

In the course of the three years of the project’s life, various additional components have been added.

Compared to the initial implementation of 2009, the greatest addition was the My2050 serious game
(available in 2011). Secondly, a cost analysis notion was added. Moreover, some updates took place in

the model (including visualisation), in order to make it easier to understand and more user friendly.

It has to be noted that the end users of the platform have the ability to correct the data embedded in
the model. They can download and remove the initial data and upload their own, something that
actually happened in South Korea case. The aforementioned model has been specifically set up to

support the energy system and notion and it would probably be difficult to be implemented in other
policy areas. Nevertheless, following the same principles, the same work could be performed for any

other policy areas from scratch.

Regarding the data used in the project, they fall into the category of public/ open (e.g. official UK
population). They do not always exist in the format needed (as expected), but they are always open. It

still is one of the main challenges to look for the best and most reliable data sources. As mentioned
before, the tool itself gives the end user the opportunity to see the utilized data himself.

A1.4 Results Achieved and Impact

At the start of the project there were no specific KPIs set. However, the numbers of visitors and of

interactions with the tool have demonstrated the success and impact of the case. In the first three
months from the official project launch there were about 10.000 unique visitors in the platform.

Regarding My2050 there are over 16.000 pathways up to the date. Regarding the stakeholders, about
200 were involved in the initial (building) phase and after the launch about 500 stakeholders were

contacted. Moreover, a week-long online debate including 5-6 experts took place with lots of
comments from open public.

One of the project’s main purposes was (and still is) to inform policy makers in a documented manner;

from this point of view, it can be considered as successful. The most concrete example is the UK
“Carbon Plan 2011” government document (how will the UK look in 2050), published in late 2011 which
included as one of the main pieces of evidence and visualisation the 2050 Pathways Calculator. In

addition, the same tool was used in budget Annual Energy Statements. Moreover, the tool was used in
General Election briefing work.

It is important to note that there are Master’s programs, both in and outside of the UK, that engage the

2050 Pathways models and tools in their courses. In addition, the my2050 game is also communicated
to pupils of various schools in the UK; there is a “schools’ toolkit” available and downloadable from the

project’s website, as well as from other websites, including the department of Education website.

It has to be noted that due to the project’s open source nature, it is quite difficult to tell how many and
who exactly are using the platform.

In addition, a large number of presentations have been conducted in workshops, schools, conferences,

NGOs, international colleagues etc. A presentation was made to the European Commission too. Really
positive media coverage has also been noticed (around 15 key articles regarding the project     57,). Other

references to the case have also been made (e.g. cultural festivals).

The main pillar of the success of the project is definitely the innovations that it brings to life. One of
these core innovations is the radical transparency and the ease of use. The model aims to encompass

all technically possible futures and form a fruitful debate based on realistic scenarios (and not on
guesses). The model provides actually valuable feedback to high-level decision makers relative to

communicating and interrogating different scenarios (e.g. what citizens really want, which
conveniences they are willing to sacrifice etc.).




A1.5 Challenges Encountered and Lessons Learned


Complex and ambitious projects such as Pathways 2050 always face quite a number of challenges.
Effective collaboration and dialogue is always time consuming; this was the case for Pathways 2050

also. The identification of time limits to be spent in dialogue is of critical manner. Another challenge is
to try to keep the ethos of the project alive, despite changes in personnel. In addition, although tools

                                    0313F02_Case studies on specific applications of ICT solutions for policy modelling





and technologies may seem easy to use by experts, they might still be difficult for open public;
facilitators are always of use. Last but not least, keeping the interest towards the initiative alive for a
long time (especially after the initial success) is also a challenging task.

Based on the Pathways 2050 experience up to today, there are many lessons that have been learnt and

can be offered as recommendations. One of the core lessons learnt was that there is a need to involve
stakeholders as early as possible. In addition, being open and transparent is estimated by end users.

Collaborative working is also one of the main assets of every large scale project, provided that proper
people have been selected for each position. The 2050 Pathways team included members from

government, industry, NGOs, academia etc.

Moreover, actual innovation can really excite people and make them efficient. In addition, it was
concluded that if something is designed in a correct and efficient manner, it could find acceptance to

audiences that were not targeted at the beginning.

A dynamic, instead of a static approach is also more possible to find acceptance in the end users.
Additionally, “be simple” is another lesson learnt; simplifying things helps both stakeholders and end

users.

A1.6 Sustainability


As every on-going initiative, 2050 Pathways took specific actions in order to engage stakeholders from
the very beginning and sustain (or even increase) them up to today.

As also mentioned previously, the main plan for increasing the stakeholders’ engagement was

presenting them the whole initiative and involving them from the very beginning. The project team also
published regularly “Calls for Evidence” so anyone that may have been missed/ overseen would get to
feed in his/ her evidence. The development of new tools for different audiences (e.g. Excel, web tool,

My2050, school toolkit) has also proved to be a successful stakeholder engagement strategy.

Peaks were recorded when the project first went online and when an article was published in BBC
website . The project has not made the most out of social media, but it provides the user with the

capability to share his/ her Pathway on Facebook/ Twitter.

The project’s stakeholders’ engagement strategy also includes various organisations that work with
schools and promote the initiative, as well as periodic newsletters.

Looking towards the future, the 2050 Pathways team is currently updating all possible data. In addition,

a comparison between the (in the past) projected and the actual results will also take place, in order to
test the credibility of the model and its results.

Secondly, an international implementation of the project, aiming at 10 developing countries (including

China, Indonesia, South Africa, Bangladesh etc.), is under preparation (it will probably be running by the
end of 2014).

In addition, the inclusion of historical data (meaning data between the initiation of the project up until

today) in the model (in order to provide a more complete image) is also a future plan.

Last but not least, there is a constant will to make the tools more efficient and attractive.

To effectively limit the social and economic damage caused by infectious diseases, the public health
communities need to be in the position to anticipate the spatial and temporal evolution of epidemics

and evaluate the potential impact of available containment and prevention strategies.

The global epidemic and mobility model, GLEAM, combines real-world data on populations and human
mobility with elaborate stochastic models of disease transmission to deliver analytic and forecasting

power to address the challenges fac60 in developing intervention strategies that minimize the impact
of potentially devastating epidemics.

GLEAM is a discrete stochastic epidemic computational model based on a meta-population approach in
which the world is defined in geographical census areas connected in a network of interactions by

human travel fluxes corresponding to transportation infrastructures and mobility patterns. The GLEAM
2.0 simulation engine includes a multi-scale mobility model     61  integrating different layers of

transportation networks ranging from the long range airline connections to the short range daily
commuting pattern. 62

Elaborate stochastic infectious disease models to support a wide range of epidemiological studies are

used, covering different types of infections and intervention scenarios in order to respond to the
spread of a pandemic crisis in very short times.

Real-world data on population and mobility networks are used and integrate those in structured spatial

epidemic models to generate data driven simulations of the worldwide spread of infectious diseases.

GLEAM runs on high performance computers to create in-silico experiments that would be hardly
feasible in real systems and to guide our understanding of typical non-linear behaviour and tipping

points of epidemic phenomena.

A suite of computational tools is provided to help modelling the spread of a disease, understanding
observed epidemic patterns, and studying the effectiveness of different intervention strategies that
policy makers think to put forward to minimize the exposure of population and to neutralise the

disease spread. The tools are available to researchers, health-care professionals and policy makers
either as direct download from the GLEAM website (light version), or via communication with the

GLEAM team in order to get the full infrastructure. The tools allow end users to create their own
models and simulate them through the GLEAM platform, so anyone can construct his own model with

different parameters. Of course, relevant competences are needed, such as a background in modelling,
epidemiology, computer simulation, etc. As it is argued below, the use of such a model requires the

support of people or of groups that posses interdisciplinary skills, in order not only to construct a solid
and close to reality model, but also to interpret the results correctly.

The basic structure of GLEAM model consists of three distinct layers:

       The population layer
       The mobility layer

       The epidemic layer

A.2.2 Case Motivation and Deployment


The initial motivation for GLEAM was a research question of public health concern: “can we do
forecasting regarding the global spreading of diseases?”. Under forecast it is not meant to predict when

the next pandemic will strike (or what it will be), but, given the fact that the World Health Organisation
(WHO) or some other similar agencies provide some warnings about a cluster of cases of a small
outbreak of epidemics, to try to be in a position to create a forecasting infrastructure for the

geographical and time spreading of these infectious diseases. This concept is quite similar to creating a
weather forecast.

The main starting point was based on research to find the algorithms, the needed data etc. From 2003

till 2009, the GLEAM team was occupied with the creation of the basic computational model that
integrates all the available/ collected data. Categories and sources of data included: data from census
agencies, data regarding population at very high resolutions, data from a world map implemented by

NASA with the world population divided to 5x5 miles area boxes, the entire database of airlines, about
40 databases from different countries for local mobility, transfer, etc.

All this data has to be integrated into the model that simulates the spreading of the diseases. This is

just the engine of the GLEAM infrastructure and the motivation to develop the entire infrastructure
came in 2009 where the team was working with agencies and private companies for analysing the
H1N1 pandemic. It was realised that it was more than difficult to communicate large amounts of data

to stakeholders as nobody knows what people are really interested in and, at the same time,
modification questions are constantly popping up in order to calibrate the model for studying different

issues. Thus, it was decided to create a computational infrastructure that allowed the GLEAM team to
setup a basic model in case of an emergency and to do almost the same heavy calibration that is

performed in a supercomputer environment, and also to make this data available for exploration
through a visual interface to agencies and people who could try to change the model’s parameters, try
different containment measures, etc. without coming back to the GLEAM team for these needs of

support.

                                     0313F02_Case studies on specific applications of ICT solutions for policy modelling





In addition, it was decided as a main principle to have parts of the model public, in order to let them be
used for academic purposes and to empower students and people teaching about infectious diseases

spread and so the public version evolve which does not contain all features of the full platform.

The GLEAM research team started working on the project prior to looking for funding and projects

willing to sponsor the attempt. Initially the work performed in areas such as computational
epidemiology, network of diseases etc. was funded as part of scientific research, but not as part of the
                                                                                                              63
GLEAM project. Once the idea was more concrete, GLEAM got funding from various US agencies (NIH ,
Defence Agency) and from the EC through some research projects (EPIWORK IP project and EPIFOR ).             65

In the website the list of all funders is available. Also, funding is still coming from 2 major corporations

(their names cannot be disclosed).

At this time, the case is supported through funding for new features. EPIWORK project funding is used
to expand the functionality of the platform, to provide APIs to introduce specific agent based models

within the existing model and to integrate the platform with another epidemic data sharing platform

that is constructed in EPIWORK. There are many research areas that allow GLEAM to keep the platform
alive and still advance development. Another part of the funding comes from various research

contracts and from corporations that want to use the platform for their epidemic preparation plans
(e.g. to evaluate the number of workers within an area that could get infected).


As also mentioned before, there are many deployments of GLEAM, including the US Defense Agency,
agencies like the EC JRC ISPRA that uses and implements GLEAM in its Crisis Management Unit or the

INSERM institute (see section 3.2.8), and other undisclosed corporations.




A.2.3 Implementation

In an initiative such as GLEAM, the expertise required in the research team is very interdisciplinary. The

team includes people coming from physics, computer science, mathematical biology, public heath

institutes, graphic designers for the interface, HCI experts. Having such a multidisciplinary team and
creating a common vision and goal is quite difficult in terms of unifying languages, skills, understanding

of each other, and different way of work.

People from JRC have played a critical role in the course of implementation, as they have been

constantly providing feedback and can be considered the first link to policy making. The GLEAM team
has also been talking a lot with policy makers from agencies that work on public health and disease

prevention, aiming to receive additional feedback.
      st                                                                rd
The 1 release of the platform took place in 2010 (2012 was the 3 year of the fully operating release).

There have been 4 major releases up to today (current release: GLEAMViz 4.0) and the major changes
focused on improving visualisation and additional capabilities. Moreover, the last release has a

different updated engine for the simulation that is 10 times faster than the previous one. A number of

3-4 minor updates are also performed every year.

The GLEAM platform is an open nature. Commercial software has been used only for development, like
Adobe Air for the client (needs licensing for developers), but for the end user it still remains free.

However, the public release available to anyone does not include all the features of the software; the
full software is released only to specific agencies (like the JRC) that are then in a position to install and

maintain the software on their servers. For several reasons the full model cannot be offered to all users
(e.g. the GLEAM team cannot directly support 20 or 50 installations and therefore support is only
provided to important agencies that are running the full model). Moreover, the full release runs on HPC

that we provide to the community so we cannot allow every user to use all the features, as a super-
computing centre would be necessary; something that is not feasible at the moment.

The basic model is developed by the GLEAM research team and is considered as a unique model, as the

GLEAM team is the one of the very few groups with global capabilities at this time in terms of epidemic
modelling. Creation of specific APIs and collaboration with other 2 groups to create an integration of

the GLEAM model with localised agent based models which are much more detailed and will bring in
the platform other computational models too is currently being planned.

The data used for the tool is mostly public data, but when talking about specific implementations (like a
pandemic plan for a big corporation), then the tool integrates data from these organisations that are

not public and cannot be publicly shared. Moreover, the tool also integrates commercial data, like the
IAA data, the OEG database, data from various census bureaus etc. These, not open, data is only used

for computations and cannot be redistributed through the tool. Everything else can be accessed
through the tool (like world population data, etc.) and is publicly available in various sources.

The GLEAM website has also a library of models (4-5 models available) and this will be enlarged by a

future release (to 10-12 models). Last but not least, the GUI allows the end user design his/ her own
models on a drag and drop canvas.

A.2.4 Results Achieved and Impact

The main achievement of GLEAM so far was the production of the forecast for the H1N1 pandemic in

real-time which was a quite successful exercise and showed the power of the model. A validation
paper has been published in December 2012 showcasing that the GLEAM predictions were quite spot
on.

Many stakeholders are also using the software and support their policy-making procedures in terms of

designing measures to prevent or constrain the spread of diseases. Examples include the US Defence
Agency, the JRC, and other corporations that are using the software. It has to be noted that JRC is using

the tool in its long-term strategy for studying and responding to the spread of epidemics (through
communicating the simulation results to DG SANTO policy officers), based on the experience that has

been accumulated from using the GLEAM toolkit during the H1N1 disease.

The core innovation of GLEAM lies within the computational model which can integrate data from
various sources and provide a close to real time forecast (by combining various real-time data sources)

on the spread of epidemics on a global level, which was not possible before at that level of precision
and punctuality.

Moreover, through the visual interface users are in a position to create their own models and

investigate specific diseases and issues that they are interested in.



A.2.5 Challenges Encountered and Lessons Learned

The main challenge in the GLEAM case has to do with sustainability. The research effort so far has

sustained the tool, but at a certain point policy makers need to provide funding for maintaining such
ICT computational tools for actual policy making, as it is happening with other product categories. Only

few agencies have small crisis management units that can maintain such tools. Many big agencies do
not have a computational or modelling unit and this requires a change of culture from the institution

and the agencies.

The first lesson learnt is that the use of Web2.0 technologies for the policy-making domain is not an
easy task, as policy makers are not used to work with these tools. There is some scepticism or in some

other cases too much trust. These computational tools are quantitative and it can be taken for granted
that policy making cannot be done solely by looking at the numbers. What needs to happen is to
complement the policy making process with this quantitative information but neither to disregard nor

underestimate the value of such information. This is due to the fact that behind each model there are
assumptions, modelling compromises, incomplete/ missing data, etc.

Based on the above, more and more accurate data is always needed. Policy makers are used to work

with data not suited for quantitative use. This way the modeller might end up with very rough statistics
that are not proper for precise calculations. The same applies for forecasting; the better data you have,

the better and more accurate the forecast will be. With very poor data you might get a very disturbed

picture of the future. So one needs to deal with how we can improve and create a culture in the policy

making environment for real-time high quality data. It is also surprising that satellites are available for
weather, but there is no such map for human mobility (so in the case of GLEAM it had to be created

from scratch). The actual technology was there but it was not used to get this kind of data. People in
the policy making environment need to understand that those data can provide an edge to the decision
making process.

The major key success factor of GLEAM has definitely been the fact that the predictions regarding H1N1

pandemic were really accurate, while working in real time helped to build a dynamic dialogue with the
policy makers, starting to build a trust relationship.

Of course, success means amongst other things to provide something which is needed and that no one

else can provide. There are many groups working at different levels (local/ regional/ country). GLEAM
escalated to a global level, not reinventing the wheel but specialising and providing innovative things
and views.

Based on the GLEAM experience there are some recommendations that can be derived. A first

recommendation will be to build into the agencies’ units that can deploy, operate and further develop
such tools. Agencies should use people that work in this research projects and let them lead inter-

agency for moving the tools to the new level within these organisations and focus on the issues they
need to tackle.

Moreover, it can be taken for granted that such tools and Web2.0 technologies are being replicated
easily. One should aim at integrating different tools and methods in an effort to help to achieve better

policy making. It has been seen that with the US storm, where 20 models were used and one could see
different dimensions, but the models were converging in similar results. So it is a matter of creating

different models that converge to similar results.

Moreover, there is a real need for creating and sharing high quality data in real time.



A.2.6 Sustainability

In the initial steps of GLEAM there was no sustainability strategy, as the community of epidemic

modelling and computation tools is pretty small. The major stakeholders have been contacted during
conferences, workshops, etc. It was the H1N1 pandemic which brought many people to the platform

and then the tool has been disseminated by word of mouth based on its application on different
pandemic scenarios.

At this time, the GLEAM team is actively participating in conferences and meetings to present the tool.
Moreover, other material has been/ is being created, such as short movies, brochures, advertisement

events, while we have also a component called “Epidemic Planet” that is exhibited in museums to
attract audience. In this content, GLEAM tries to push the tool into the education environment to

facilitate students to learn more about epidemic spreading and global diseases, in order to make the
younger generation more familiar with the tool and the project.

In addition, future plans include several improvements and enrichments regarding the tool itself.
Another direction of work has been towards human infection diseases, and the creation of a model for

                                    0313F02_Case studies on specific applications of ICT solutions for policy modelling





vector born diseases (like malaria) that require the knowledge from other vectors such as mosquitos is
foreseen. In this context, the tool can be surely used for other issues as well.

Another direction is to move into other areas of contagion, so as to deal not only with infectious
diseases, but also work with knowledge information for other epidemiological concepts.

Moreover, the GLEAM team plans to include more data and models in the platform and, depending on

the resolution and the needs of the users, to create different ways to investigate the evolution of the
epidemic. In principle, the basic idea is to use social media like Twitter for such purposes, which will

bring the tool also cover early detection and not only forecasting, and also investigate how this can be
applied in other phenomena. This can be seen as a task for the next 5-10 years.

Launched by the U.S. Department of State in collaboration with Berkeley University which developed
it, "Opinion Space" bridges the worlds of politics and social media in an interactive visualization forum,

where users can engage in open dialog on foreign affairs and global policies. It invites users to share
their perspectives and ideas in an innovative visual "opinion map" that will illustrate which ideas result

in the most discussions and which ideas are judged most insightful by the community of participants.

Using an experimental gaming model, Opinion Space incorporates techniques from deliberative polling,
collaborative filtering, and multidimensional visualization. The result is a self-organizing system that
uses an intuitive graphical "map" that displays patterns, trends, and insights as they emerge and

employs the wisdom of crowds to identify and highlight the most insightful ideas.

                              Figure A-8: Expressing opinions in Opinion Space



Opinion Space exploits the power of connection technologies to ‘depolarize’ discussions by including all
participants on a level playing field and by encouraging communication between people who may not

agree with each other. In Opinion Space the layout is determined completely by the data entered by
participants: it is computed using statistical dimensionality reduction techniques. Using Principal

Component Analysis (PCA) from advanced mathematics, multiple opinions (more than two) can be
projected onto two dimensions and still approximate original distance relationships. So if the yellow
dot that represents a user is located on the left, that doesn’t mean you’re more liberal. Opinion Space

is designed to move beyond the usual left-right linear spectrum to display "constellations" of opinions.
Opinion Space also includes “landmarks” (blue dots) that represent the opinions of public figures based

on “educated extrapolation.”

Actually, rather than solidifying opinions into binary silos that are by nature oppositional, Opinion
Space gathers information from users on a range of topics and then places each user on a map in

relation to the opinions of others. The "geography" of the map changes as new users enter the system.
Clusters of orbs, resembling little solar systems, form around certain combinations of shared opinions.

In an illustrative example, the user once sign in the platform has to answer 5 questions that deal with
nuclear weapons, proactive diplomacy, climate change, investing in food and women empowerment.

The user selects whether he agrees with the statements presented (using an analogue slider to express
his agreement/disagreement) and his position (marked by a blue spot) gets placed in the 2D opinion

Space. Then the user is presented with more questions that he can answer using free text to state his
position. After that, the user is able to explore other user’s opinions, where he can state the degree he

agrees with these statements or not.

In summary, Opinion Space helps policy makers:

       Understand the diversity of their communities.

       Solicit feedback and creative suggestions on specific topics.
       Rapidly identify the most insightful ideas and suggestions.
       Increase satisfaction and engagement with their communities.

Opinion Space also helps citizens:

       Visualize their relationships to other people.
       Express thoughtful ideas and suggestions about emerging issues.
       Engage in friendly competition with other people.

       Learn and gain insights from other people.



A3.2 Case Motivation and Deployment

The initial concept behind Opinion Space was to bring the world of big data to brainstorming (the
process of generating ideas): how can the end user take advantage of the world of big data in the

process of generating ideas? Can algorithms and statistical techniques (that worked well in other areas,
such as robotics) operate towards this direction?

After the election of President Obama, the government had a social media orientation, which provided

fertile ground for the first trigger case.

Opinion Space was based on a few prior projects that dealt with:
       Recommending NPOs to people so as to donate,

       Recommending jobs (background recommendation systems in general).

The combination of recommendation systems and visualisation was the main trigger behind Opinion
Space. Policy makers need to know what the population they serve thinks; and this is definitely a
complicated problem. Surveys are not the solution; they can be communicated only to a certain

number of people and need processing. Policy makers need to be able to take a quick “snapshot” of
what people think. That’s the need that Opinion Space solves.

Opinion Space has been based on a mix of funding grants (e.g. NSF grants). In addition, every individual
project has also received some industry funding.

Typically the way that individual implementations work is through initial contacts that lead to

implementation; there are no contracts in the business sense. Organisations fund Opinion Space in
order to view the results of this kind of research in their domains (e.g. Fujitsu funded Opinion Space in

order to see the results of sentiment analysis on e-learning).
The first two projects of Opinion Space (in 2009) were with the US State Department. Then, by

generalising the system, Opinion Space worked with a US auto-maker (that requested to stay
anonymous), with an insurance company, an HR department in UniLever (what employees thought

about various policy decisions in the company), in various academia-oriented questions, in local state
measures (e.g. California) etc.

Opinion Space is fully operational in its current state. Nevertheless, as a research platform it still

remains experimental. The great amount of data is very structured and this helps towards continuing
research on text analysis, statistical modelling etc.


A.3.4 Implementation

Opinion Space uses a technique in order to project a five-dimension (up to eight-dimension) space in
the two-dimension space. This is used in order to visualise diversity, which is critical for the purposes of

Opinion Space. This technique was selected because it is established in other domains, such as robotics.
Visual analogue slider is also used in the frames of Opinion Space in order to give users the ability to

rate in a continuous manner and not in a binary one (like/ dislike).

Thus, mathematics, mathematical modelling, industrial and artificial intelligence background can be
found in the members of the Opinion Space team. Design groups and human-computers interaction
groups were/ are also consulted.

Policy makers are also directly involved. They make their questions but they always need our

assistance. The Opinion Space team involvement is not necessary, but it actually makes the system
operate in a better way. Policy makers are also involved in the course of the development: the

development is modular and they provide feedback in every step. In this way, they also provide initial
ideas and they get familiar with the whole system.

Opinion Space has been running since 2009. Besides 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 (current version), there were
various unnamed versions of the initiative (mostly based on the 3.0 code).

Version 1.0 basically just visualised diversity and it was not really an idea generation platform. In

version 2.0 the development tried to capture and visualise the user interaction and the main innovation
introduced was the ranking system; users could evaluate each other’s ideas. In version 3.0 the idea was

                                               Page 69 of 180
                                   0313F02_Case studies on specific applications of ICT solutions for policy modelling




to make the whole platform user centric. We incorporated ideas from human-computer interaction

into the platform. Another innovation was the introduction of more and more sophisticated statistical
tools. After that the main focus was on increasing traffic.

In addition, there is an additional moderator space for policy makers. It gives them a wrap-up of the top

ideas and allows them to change ideas etc.
Opinion Space primarily uses open source software. However, Opinion Space’s license is assigned to

the Berkeley University.

Specific technologies and tools include a web application that hooks up to a database analytic system (a
relational database to be more specific, as a lot of the available data is extremely structured) through

middleware. The UI is a flash-based interface and the statistical platform is Python-based. Opinion
Space also incorporates techniques from deliberative polling, collaborative filtering, statistical

inference, and dimensionality reduction. Opinion Space’s techniques can be easily applied to other sets
of existing open data.



A.3.5 Results Achieved and Impact


One of the first and main indicators was the participation rate; users that arrive in the platform for the
first time and those that become active participants. People that arrive in websites are always more
than those who actually participate (in some projects the rate was close to 50% and in others around

10%).

In the State Department instance (of Opinion Space 3.0), more than 2000 different ideas were collected
(about US foreign policy). In addition, more than 5000 individual responses were collected. It cannot be

said whether the final decisions were based on some of the ideas provided, but a detailed report was
provided to the policy makers. The project with a US auto-maker (targeted towards recognising ways of

improving their image) resulted to about 1000 ideas and about 100.000 ratings evaluating these ideas
(e.g. more specifically they talked about green vehicles).

Based on the previous paragraphs and to Opinion Space’s understanding, the results exceeded even
the optimistic expectations, taking into consideration that the target groups are specific and limited in

most of the implementations. If the cases targeted towards vast amounts of open public, the goal was
not met. But in terms of specific target groups, they exceeded expectations.

One of the core innovations and successes of Opinion Space is the very fast way to browse (and rate)
amongst a large number of ideas (even if this is a visualisation-oriented innovation). From the scientific

point of view, the greatest innovation was bringing statistical analysis in structured discussion/ data.

One of the best endorsements regarding Opinion Space was Hillary Clinton’s reference to the initiative.
Other endorsements include high level officers of collaborating companies as presented in the Opinion

Space website.

As far as the Opinion Space team is aware of, Opinion Space has not yet been incorporated in any
formal decision making procedures. The State Department, however, uses “informally” Opinion Space
in order to get ideas and opinions on specific policies.

A.3.6 Challenges Encountered and Lessons Learned


Challenges that the Opinion Space teams need to tackle with are of various natures. Firstly, the Opinion
Space platform performs a lot of actions so maybe a lighter version should be considered.

In terms of policy makers, many concerns on privacy have been raised; different regulations regarding
data make things even more complex.

In addition, when introducing a new concept/ technology, users might be reluctant in using it.

Last but not least, the choice to implement the platform on Flash has led to loss of all Apple-devices

users.

In terms of risks, two principal risks can be identified:
    (i)      implementation – the result might not be the desired or requested one,

    (ii)     not well structured ideas/ questions (e.g. what is the meaning of life) or inability to refer to
             the proper audience may result to failure in participation.

Regarding lessons learnt, above all is that the slightest effort needed by the user really affects
participation; everything needs to be easy and user friendly. For example, by increasing the start-
questions from 5 to 8, participation decreased almost 50%. In addition, the Opinion Space team learnt

more about machine learning techniques and algorithms and their capabilities and sensitivities.

From the policy makers point of view (State Department to be more specific), they learnt that ideas can
be very diverse and scattered; and many times this is neglected by media and press.

In addition, when someone applies social media systems in policy making procedures he always seeks

for the lightest application possible, which works across all platforms (operating systems, mobile
devices) and is easily set and operated.

Regarding the overall Opinion Space concept, one can say that the platform works particularly well
when you apply it to a specific use case or/ and a well-formulated idea.




A.3.7 Sustainability

First of all, Opinion Space can trigger/ invite users of other/ older Opinion Space cases to participate in
new ones. The “core” users of Opinion Space are about a couple of hundreds.

In addition, the Opinion Space team uses Google adwords, SEO and sends emails to relative emailing

lists.

The increase of users really depends on the timing, as well as on how interested are people about the
specific subject under consideration.

Opinion Space is technically capable of handling any kind of question. Any brainstorming/ idea
generation project in any kind of organization can be supported.

In addition, there is a continuous effort to make the platform easier and more user-friendly. Opinion

Space team is working on a lighter Opinion Space implementation, without the initial five questions; it

will just ask the user to comments and his/ her comments will be evaluated. In addition, work is
performed on a “global” version of Opinion Space based on HTML, which will work across any platform.

In terms of research, the team is working on machine learning techniques that can help dealing with

larger amounts of data. Moreover, amelioration of algorithms is also a continuous research theme.

There is also a plan of collaborating between Opinion Space and the State Department once again. Last
but not least, independent projects come up in the course of time.

UrbanSim is a software-based demographic and development modelling tool for integrated planning
and analysis of urban development, incorporating the interactions between land use, transportation,

environment, economy and public policy with demographic information. It simulates in a 3D
environment the choices of individual households, businesses, and parcel landowners and developers,

interacting in urban real estate markets and connected by a multi-modal transportation system. The 3D
output of the aforementioned process is presented using indicators, which are variables that convey

information on significant aspects of the simulation results.

This approach works with individual agents as done in agent-based modelling, and with very small cells
as in the cellular automata approach, or even at building and parcel levels. UrbanSim differs from
                                                       70
these approaches by drawing together choice theory , a simulation of real estate markets, and
statistical methods in order to achieve accurate estimation of the necessary model parameters (such as

land policies, infrastructure choices, etc.) in order to calibrate uncertainty in its system. As an example
of its use, one could refer to the project on Modelling Land Use Change in Chittenden County , where

the model parameters based on statistical analysis of historical data, the model then integrated market
behaviour, land policies, infrastructure choices in order to produce simulations on household,

employment and real estate development decisions (where the first two were based on an agent-based
approach while the latter on a grid-based approach).

In the case of Salt Lake City Utah, UrbanSim supports metropolitan planning and policy analysis in a
more scientifically rigorous manner than the land-use model previously used by the Wasatch Front
                 80
Regional Council , with land-use forecasts being influenced by the proposed transportation system. By
integrating UrbanSim with the regional travel models, a range of land use and transportation policy

interventions can be combined into policy scenarios and the systematic effects of these scenarios can
be explored on urban development outcomes and the quality of the transportation system.

                                 81                                  82
Three software tools (i.e. GIS , UrbanSim, and Travel Model ) are used concurrently and pass
information back and forth to each other - for example, modified GIS layers were provided to

UrbanSim, which in turn is able to modify the layer and port it back into the GIS as a new layer
depicting a specific urban scenario. This flexible technology package, while not unique to this planning

effort, allows planners to model future land use patterns and populations, create a travel model for the
future community, and depict the results in tables and maps. Thus, alternative solutions can be created

and evaluated.



A.4.2 Case Motivation and Deployment


UrbanSim as a software platform has been developed for the last 15 years now. The initial idea came
after an extensive literature review mostly on urban economics, micro-simulation and GISs. The

software platform itself was developed from scratch.

In the mid 1990’s (when UrbanSim was first conceived) the original motivation was to interact in the
policy analysis domain at the metropolitan scale, principally around the issues of transportation and

land use, as well as environmental planning. The context was initially limited to the U.S. including the
metropolitan planning organisations of each geographical area, which are the legally mandated

organisations to undertake regional transportation planning, and to funnel federal funds for
transportation projects.

The challenge that UrbanSim was initially trying to address was the shortcoming in analytical capacity

of Metropolitan Planning Organisations (MPOs), as they were unable to effectively analyse the
secondary or cumulative impacts of transportation investments (e.g. new highways, highway widening,

rail transit) on urban development (e.g. where new housing gets developed). The consequence of this
limitation was that there was a significant bias towards overestimating the benefits of new

construction and highway capacity expansion and this became the basis for legal challenges, mainly by
the environmental movement (they challenged legally decisions of implementing new construction

projects without considering the long-term impact).

Thus, the UrbanSim platform was designed and implemented as a way to analyse the effects of changes

in the transport system on urban development (travel patterns, effectiveness of transport projects).

Nevertheless, this original motivation has evolved over the years. It still maintains the core of allowing
analysis of secondary/ accumulated effects of transport-related investments, but now more broadly

encompasses the desire of many local and regional planning policy makers to assess the impacts of land

use policies (e.g. in California there is legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions not only by
changing types of fuels/ vehicles; the law calls also for MPOs to coordinate with local cities to change

land use patterns in ways that reduce the need to travel by car). So, based on this agenda, UrbanSim
now deals with evaluating packages of measures of specific planning or transportation policies that

include examining building codes, incentives, impact, different policies etc. At this time, UrbanSim has a
portfolio of transfer-related projects but also land use policies.

More recently, increased interest has been noted in analysing policies that relate to portable housing

(caravans), equity and economic development. In addition, increased interest has been shown towards
engaging open public in decision making processes/ policy design (e.g. recent project in San Francisco
area is aiming to develop a 3D visualisation system that would complement UrbanSim in providing

capacity for community residents and local planners to be able to visualize alternative scenarios and
have a stronger intuition around what these alternatives might look like in terms of their impact on
                                            83
urban development over the next 30 years ).

The initial funding came from a consulting project in order to design and develop and urban simulation
model of the Honolulu MPO. Subsequently, a National Science Foundation grant was obtained (for an

urban research initiative) which led to a substantial increase in the research on how to approach such a
complex simulation and policy analysis platform. The initial findings led to several more grants from
                                                                                                         84
NSF (probably 6 different – over $10,000,000 in total). In addition, the EU FP7 project “Sustain City”
has brought some additional funding to further support the development of the tools and to work on

introducing new characteristics.

Nevertheless, most of the real-world application growth has come from contracts with various MPOs
that have actually used the system. There have been quite a number of deployments including USA,

Europe and Africa.

It has to be noted that the experience in the US is very different than in Europe (and also other
international applications). The main difference is that UrbanSim has been actively involved in

developing the applications in close collaboration with NPOs in US and has moved from a research to
an applied context (they are actually being used in formal/ legal planning efforts – public

administrations fund and actually use the platform), while in Europe UrbanSim had a modest advisory
role.

The reason behind the different philosophies of deployment in the US and in the EU case is not clear,

yet it could be attributed to the following limitations in the EU endeavour:

       Since UrbanSim is a research project most of the work is being done by research teams
        scattered throughout Europe without any active involvement of government agencies. Much
        time has thus been devoted on doing research that the participating research teams were
        interested in, but with less engagement of the actual planning agencies.

       UrbanSim provided some innovations in terms of access to software/ algorithm/ models
        improvements. Yet there were difficulties caused by the new users of UrbanSim that had not
        interacted with the platform before and were not experienced in developing models,

        calibrating them, adding data etc. This is of course normal, as the tool has been available for
        more than 10 years in the US (but had never been deployed in the EU before), and as a result

         US practitioners have used it to develop related models and are in that way highly experienced
         in creating such models.




A.4.3 Implementation


In terms of methodologies, UrbanSim uses preliminary data analysis to organize an integrated
UrbanSim data system (data fusion or data integration methodology), behavioral models , metric         87
                                88                         89
models, regression models , free choice models                and equilibrating dynamics. Most recently
methodologies for community engagement have been implemented (through a visual environment in

which users can compare side by side two different propositions). In terms of technologies, free choice

modelling can be also considered as a technology, technologies for analysing uncertainty, techniques
for validating models, technologies for 3D urban modelling).

Due to its complex nature, UrbanSim requires a multidisciplinary development team: Ph.D. graduates in

computer science, computer graphics, urban planning, transportation planning and modelling, civil

engineering, urban real estate design and development and finance. The core team also closely
collaborates with experts in community engagement and participation.


Policy makers have been involved in the implementation, especially in the US cases. When applied
projects with planning organizations are implemented, the end-users are active participants in the

whole process (even from the research part). Planners and analysts from the PAs are actively involved
in what UrbanSim calls “agile modelling” which is actually a continuous iteration od modelling activities

in order to streamline and optimise the models that will be used for the tool. UrbanSim follows a very

modular approach that allows the team to reconfigure and add any required part of the model, due to
the fact that the model may alter dramatically amongst various application cases due to the different

characteristics of each area. Policy makers are also involved in monthly iterations where they use and
test the model under development and provide feedback. This helps not only in terms of feedback, but

also in terms of the policy makers getting familiar with the model and platform.

The first platform implementation was implemented in Java. In 2005 a decision was taken in order to

re-implement it in Python. Most recently (during the last year), a new extension of UrbanSim has been
                          90
developed, UrbanVision , which is a 3D urban visualisation and supports also editing scenario analysis,
where the user can edit parcels, building or zoning data and generate and visualise this alternative

scenarios.

Initially, UrbanSim was available as an open source license downloadable from the web for more than
10 years. UrbanVision and some additional extensions are implemented in a new platform in C++.

Those were decided to be distributed as closed source, with various pricing profiles (e.g. for public
agencies, private agencies, educational/ research institutes etc.). The decision was taken mostly due to

competition from commercial entities.

With the modularity followed in UrbanSim, different configurations for any models can be created and

the user (e.g. policy makers, expert consultants etc.) is taught how to change those configurations (e.g.
change a residential location model with another). However, users have very diverse interests and

technical background levels. The number of users that actually want to go deep into the models is
relatively small. Support is provided towards any UrbanSim-related activity.

As far as the data utilized in the frames of the whole UrbanSim approach are concerned, in the past,
the various involved agencies (e.g. public authorities) have typically been very protective of their data.

Some data (the minority of them) were indeed legally protected/ confidential/ proprietary (in various
senses), while the majority was open. Yet, authorities were protective with all of them and kept them

private after the completion of the project. What UrbanSim is beginning to do, both by working with a
university (University of California, Berkeley) and by developing the proper tool, is to create an online
platform in which it is requested from agencies to contribute their data in order to become publicly

available and create an API to access them. This could constitute a valuable offer towards enriching the
notion and actual quality of Open Data. This repository could be used both for research and for the

models (having access to an archive of data is a key factor towards successful models).



A.4.4 Results Achieved and Impact

As far as the impact is concerned, the European case is not at the same level as the US ones. In the US

there are quite a number of MPOs that actively utilize the UrbanSim platform. The most indicative
application, representing the approach common in the US, is probably the San Francisco Bay one. The

results of the aforementioned case have involved examining and analysing five alternative scenarios
that required articulating a set of assumptions about land use policies, transport policies and macro-
economic growth (the analysis in now complete – relevant publications will be available in the next few

months).

In one of them, analysing visibility of the proposed policy though reverse engineering was attempted,
that made the task much more challenging, both in terms of research and implementation. The agency

has now accepted the results, with documentation and visualization supporting them.

In the San Francisco case, the 3D visualization system (output shown in Figure 12) was created in order
to achieve higher visibility amongst citizens than the plain UrbanSim tool. The intention was to use this
system in a number of workshops held during January 2012. User engagement was intense even from

the development/testing phase. In addition, the public agencies used it in a series of meetings with
community organizations. Each of these meetings had from 15 up to 200 participants each. The point of

these meetings was to communicate the different scenarios to the public and to receive feedback on
the preferences of the citizens.

One of the most innovative elements of UrbanSim is the combination of various technological and
theoretical aspects, as well as the withdrawal of strong assumptions regarding urban planning and

adoption of less strong assumptions (than markets are an equilibrium). For example, the impacts of
transport projects on urban planning are far from being instantaneously realized (in fact they might

evolve over decades). In addition, the capacity of being able to support these less strong assumptions
can also be considered as a core innovation.


                                               Page 79 of 180
                                   0313F02_Case studies on specific applications of ICT solutions for policy modelling




The core innovation in the particular case of San Francisco can be found between the following two:

    (i)     the visualization, that resulted to higher community engagement (UrbanVision component)
            and

    (ii)    the creation of a new approach towards modelling real estate markets, based in pro forma
            analysis.

The case has been recognized by policy makers and incorporated in their formal procedures. Thus, it
can be said that it has been incorporated in the long-term policy making by policy makers of the San
Francisco area.




A.4.5 Challenges Encountered and Lessons Learned

One of the key lessons learnt from the UrbanSim case has been the fact that having a balance between
academic research (mostly funded by NSF but also others) and real-world applications towards

producing real working systems, is a really effective approach.

Moreover, when dealing with such applications, it is very important to engage people from the early
steps of the project, in order to get them familiar with the tool and acquire as much feedback data as
possible.

Another recommendation deals with early engagement; policy makers and end users (e.g. expert

consultants) in general need to be engaged in the project as soon as possible.

Adequate time for the development of the models and testing of the models is also necessary.

Additionally, finding out a new public engagement strategy, more capable on avoiding public disruption
movements is also advisable (probably through smaller meeting and interaction through the web), as
public disruption was eventually an unexpected challenge.

Some of the main challenges faced were the very short time frames of the project (regarding its

implementation) and having rather poor data available from agencies to begin the project.

Having too much software development at the same time was another (probably inevitable in such
projects) risk.



A.4.6 Sustainability


The agile modelling approach mentioned earlier is part of the stakeholders’ engagement strategy, as
well as early collaborative testing of the model and the visualisation tools. The stakeholders’

engagement strategy did increase the participation over some months, but participation spiked during
January 2012, when the public meetings took place. After this phase, more analytical modelling
followed, and another round of public engagement took place.

UrbanSim is already exploring transportation and land use domains, as well as urban design.

Environmental issues (e.g. greenhouse gas emissions) were motivation to some projects (such as

UrbanSim for Canada ); so environmental planning is also quite relevant. Energy consumption and/ or

water consumption constitutes issues of interest too. Modelling the impact of climate change (e.g. on
weather) is also a topic of interest. Finally, as also mentioned earlier, economic development/ policies

are also under consideration.

The UrbanSim team is currently thinking on how to organize communicating UrbanSim to European
public administrations (and establish an office in Europe as well) and other countries (e.g. Singapore,

Argentina). In addition, the expansion of the UrbanSim development team and the establishment of

more partnerships are on-going.

In addition, the online platform in which agencies are asked to contribute their data is still an on-going
effort. Moreover, further amelioration of the robustness and generalization of the model is also an on-

going piece of work. There is also collaboration with academia on big data, based on an NSF grant.

1. Rationale

Question 1.1 - What was the motivation/justification to design, develop and deploy the case? Which

needs of policy makers are you addressing? How is your case linked to the policy cycle? Was it based
on previous work/project or did you start it as a new initiative? Who were the initiators of the

initiative?

The project began in summer 2009 and the my2050 simulation was not part of the initial work (it came
a bit later). At that time, the Department of Energy and Climate Change was newly formed and tried to

formulate its first position/ strategy/ white paper. The department had at that time to work towards
some targets (e.g. reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% by 2050), without having the

answers on whether it was possible or how it could be done. This need sparked the idea for the 2050
Calculator – it was a new initiative.


The department already had various analytical models (such as MarkAl) that could be used, but these
models were really complicated and hard to use. In addition, decision makers were not sure which

model was the right one to use, especially when two (or more) models gave different answers on the
same questions. As a result of that, the department decided that a different kind of model was needed


                                            Page 82 of 180
                                  0313F02_Case studies on specific applications of ICT solutions for policy modelling




in order to be fast, transparent, stable and effective. Thus, this was a fine opportunity for the project to

start. The White Paper had close attention of the most senior people (e.g. Secretary of State,
Permanent Secretary, Director-Generals, Director of Strategy) In addition, the chief scientific advisor of

the department at that time, Professor David MacKay, was really keen on this piece of work and was
really fond of an idea like the 2050 calculator.
Concerning the implementation, there were lots of involved stakeholders. There was a core team (6-10

people) of the department of Energy and Climate Change (who were leading the work), people from
other governmental departments (e.g. transport, industry department) and probably hundreds of

external stakeholders (from NGOs, academia, industry, experts). All the needed development was
based in collaboration with various actors.

Regarding the Policy Cycle, the project probably fits in the first step, this of Agenda Setting. This is due
to the fact that the concept is a high-level one (e.g. reduce gas emissions to 80% by 2050). As the data
are currently being updated and a comparison between the projected and the actual results will take

place, probably the case could in the near future fit into the Monitor and Evaluation Policy Cycle step.



Question 1.2 - What was your funding source at the beginning? How did you manage to get this
funding? Which stakeholders have been involved? What is your case’s business model at the
moment?


The project was initiated by the Department of Energy and Climate Change, which was also the funding
source. Indicative categories of the actual effort included:

       6-10 persons for the first phase, about a year (designing and building the model)
       Searching and collecting the necessary information
       Call for evidence (6 people for 7 months)
       Adding costs analysis (4 people for 9 months)

       Maintaining and improving model (4 people)
       International and UK engagement work (4 people)
Small extra funding were found occasionally (e.g. a public engagement organization helped to fund the

My2050 game (53.000 pounds) and the so called “Deliberative Dialogue”, but still the main source of
funding is the leading department. More recently two million pounds were provided by the
International Climate Fund so as to help promote the initiative in 10 developing countries besides the

UK.



Question 1.3 – Describe the different deployments of your initiative/case. Where is it deployed?
What are the themes/topics of interest? Is it in experimental mode or fully operational? What is the

role of various stakeholders involved?

The project was launched in summer 2010, fully operational with Excel model and user-friendly web
tool. The tool was updated twice in 2011, including launching the Game version My2050. With

additions and ameliorations, the only completely operating deployment of the case is the one
described in the document at hand and it can definitely be considered as fully operational. An

international version of the project (existing in China, Belgium, South Korea and aiming at 10
developing countries) is in the making.


                                             Page 83 of 180
                                0313F02_Case studies on specific applications of ICT solutions for policy modelling




As far as the various stakeholders involved are concerned, two phases can be distinguished:

       The building phase, which included modellers, peer reviewers of the numbers that were used
       The running phase



2. Implementation

Question 2.1 - Which specific methodologies/approaches were used? How were they selected? What

is the expertise required of the research team involved and how is the interaction with users
addressed? Are policy makers involved in the implementation as users?


First of all an experienced/ lead modeler (using the most recent version of Excel) was necessary in
order to fulfill the demanding task of modeling the necessary components. In addition, a project
management team was needed in order to put all the stakeholders together and coordinate the whole

work. Moreover, experts were put as leaders in individual teams that dealt with specific issues. Of
course, a partner with Web2.0 and programming experience was also involved. Other necessary

“components” are objectivity, diplomacy, transparency, collaboration and understanding.
We have identified as potential challenges touched by 2050 Pathways Analysis the following:

    -   Policy Modelling
           o   Collaborative Modelling
           o   Immersive Simulation

           o   Output Analysis and Knowledge Synthesis
    -   Data-powered Collaborative Governance

           o   Open Government Data
           o   Serious Gaming for Behavioural Change
           o   Collaborative Governance



Question 2.2 - How long have you been running the platform/system? How many major updates

have you implemented and what was the reason for these, if any?What specific technologies/ tools
were used? Were they open source/ free/ commercial? Are there any other technologies you are
planning to deploy?


The project started in the summer of 2009. The greatest addition was the my2050 game that was not
available from the very beginning (available in 2011). Secondly, a cost analysis notion was added, which

was quite a challenging task. Moreover, some updates have taken place in the model (including
visualisation), making it easier to understand and more user friendly.
The my2050 is considered a serious game.

The main model of the case is based on Excel. The project uses open source software, which was a
strategic decision of the project team. In addition, the platform provides the end user the ability to

comment and make propositions for ameliorating the platform and the whole concept. There is also
integration with social media: the platform gives the end user the opportunity to share his/ her
pathway to Facebook and Twitter.





                                           Page 84 of 180
                                   0313F02_Case studies on specific applications of ICT solutions for policy modelling




Question 2.3 - Which are the policy/simulation/computational models you are using to support the

platform/system? Can other models replace them, or is the platform/system built entirely on their
operations/ input-outputs? What kind of data do you use for your cases (open data/big data/public

sector data/private date/etc.)? How are you handling them?

The end users have the ability to correct the data that is embedded in the model. They can download
and remove the initial data and upload their own (e.g. that happened in South Korea case).

The model has been specifically set up to support the energy system and notion and it would probably
be difficult to be implemented in other policy areas. In any case, following the same principles, the

same work could be done for any other policy areas from scratch.
All data used in the project are public/ open (e.g. official UK population). They do not always exist in the
format needed, but they are always open. The challenge is to look for the best and most reliable

possible source. The tool itself gives the end user the opportunity to see the utilized data himself. Of
course, one can find many different types of data in the model; from simple (like population) to

sophisticated (like data referring to engineering or physics).


3. Results Achieved and Impact


Question 3.1 - What are the main results achieved by the case/initiative? What are the key indicators
of the project/ initiative (either impact-oriented or operation/ technology-oriented)? How were they

selected/ developed? Were/ Are they met?

At the start of the project there was no specific set of KPIs set. In the first three months from the
official project launch there were about 10.000 unique visitors in the platform. Regarding the my2050

there are over 16.000 pathways up to the date.
Regarding the stakeholders, about 200 were involved in the initial (building) phase and after the launch

about 500 stakeholders were contacted. Moreover, a week-long online debate including 5-6 experts
took place with lots of comments from open public.
In addition, a large number of presentations have been conducted in workshops, schools, conferences,

NGOs, international colleagues etc. A presentation was made to the European Commission too. Really
positive media coverage has also been noticed (around 15 key articles regarding the project). Other

references to the case have also been made (e.g. cultural festivals).


Question 3.2 - What is the impact achieved (or expected) of the project/ initiative both overall and

per stakeholder group? Who were the stakeholders/ stakeholder groups involved / served? How (if)
is the case been used in practice to support policy making?


The project’s initial purpose was to inform in a documented manner policy makers; and it was very
successful. The most concrete example is the UK “Carbon Plan 2011” government document (how will
the UK look in 2050), published in late 2011 which included as one of the main pieces of evidence and

visualisation the 2050 Pathways calculator. In addition, the tool was used in budget statements and
Annual Energy Statements. Moreover, the tool was used in General Election briefing work.

It is important to note that there are Master’s programs, both in and outside of the UK, that engage the


                                              Page 85 of 180
                                   0313F02_Case studies on specific applications of ICT solutions for policy modelling




2050 Pathways models and tools in their courses. In addition, the my2050 game is also communicated

to pupils of various schools in the UK (there is a “schools’ toolkit” available and downloadable from the
project’s website, as well as from other websites – including the department of Education website).

There are also a few other organisations that use the project’s calculator.
NGOs are also utilizing the tool, in order to set their strategies and plans out.
It has to be noted that due to the project’s open source nature, it is quite difficult to tell how many and

who exactly are using the platform.



Question 3.3 - Which is the core innovation of your project / initiative? Has your case been
recognised by policy makers? If so, to what extent? How has it been incorporated in long/short term
policy making by decision makers?


One of the core innovations of the projects is the radical transparency and the ease of use. The model
aims to encompass all technically possible futures and form a fruitful debate based on realistic

scenarios (and not on guesses). The model provides actually valuable feedback to high-level decision
makers relative to communicating and interrogating different scenarios.
The 2050 Pathways is part of a long-term governmental strategy. As also stated before it is part of the

UK “Carbon Plan”document, published in late 2011.



4. Challenges encountered and lessons learned

Question 4.1 - What are the key lessons learned? Which were the key success factors and drivers that
enabled positive developments?


One of the core lessons learned was that there is a need to involve people as early as possible; the early
involvement of all kind of stakeholders was really helpful in the case. In addition, it helps to be open;

people appreciate openness and transparency. Collaborative working was also fruitful and constituted
a real benefit. Moreover, actual innovation can really excite people and make them efficient.
In addition, we learned that if you design something really well, it could find acceptance to audiences

you did not have in mind at the beginning. A dynamic, instead of a static approach is also more possible
to find acceptance in the end users. Additionally, “be simple” is another lesson learnt; simplifying things

helps both stakeholders and end users.
Of course, recruiting the right people for the right position is critical for the success of each project. The
team included members from government, industry, NGOs, academia etc.

As a high level conclusion also, without the internet, the project wouldn’t have meaning, wouldn’t have
been implemented at all. Last but not least, you have to keep reminding people why you are doing

what you are doing.



Question 4.2 - What are the main drawbacks of your case and the barriers you faced during
implementation?

Effective collaboration and dialogue is always time consuming. One has to draw the line and identify

the limits of the time that are needed to be spent in dialogue. Another challenge is to try to keep the

ethos of the project alive despite changes in personnel. In addition, although it may seem easy to use

to experts, it may still be difficult for open public; facilitators can be of use. Keeping the interest alive
for a long time (especially after the initial success) is also challenging.



Question 4.3 - Which recommendations would you provide based on the experience gained in your
case? Which risks have you identified and should be taken under consideration? How to overcome

the barriers faced?

Based on the up to today project’s experience, we could say that the main recommendations are:

       Plan carefully; take into consideration the timelines of all stakeholders
       Involve people as early as possible

       Be simple and create simple to use tools
       Hire the right people at key positions, especially after launch for the steady state phase of the
        project



5. Sustainability


Question 5.1 - Was there any specific stakeholder engagement strategy so as to gain visibility and
'buy-in'? Did you manage a steady increase of participating users, or was there a peak due to a
special event?


As before, the main plan increasing the stakeholders’ engagement was presenting them the whole
initiative and involving them from the very beginning; even from when we had a blank sheet of paper.

There is also a Delphi debate for expert discussion.
The project team also published “Calls for Evidence” so anyone that may have been missed/ overseen
would get to feed in his/ her evidence.

The development of new tools for different audiences (e.g. Excel, web tool, My2050, school toolkit)
was also a successful stakeholder engagement strategy.

Peaks were recorded when the project first went online and when an article was published in BBC
website. The project has not made the most out of social media, but it provides the capability to share
on Facebook/Twitter.

The project’s stakeholders’ engagement strategy also includes various organisations that work with
schools and promote the initiative. Newsletters also exist.



Question 5.2 - Do you think that your case/tools could be applied in other domains? If yes, please

name them and discuss the possible changes that would be required.

The model has been specifically set up to support the energy system and it would probably be difficult
to be deployed in other domains. In any case, following the same principles, the same work could be

done for other policy areas from scratch.


Question 5.3 - What are your future plans/ steps regarding the case/initiative?


                                              Page 87 of 180
                                    0313F02_Case studies on specific applications of ICT solutions for policy modelling





First of all, data is currently being updated and a comparison between the projected and the actual
results will take place. As such, the case could probably in the near future fit into the Monitor and

Evaluation Policy Cycle step. Secondly, an international implementation of the project, aiming at 10
developing countries (including China, Indonesia, South Africa, Bangladesh), is in the making (by the

end of 2014). In addition, the inclusion of historic (earlier) data is also a future plan.
At the moment there is no strong link among the three models of the project and that’s something the

team is currently working into.We will keep informing all the stakeholders about the project’s
advancements and keep aiding decision makers in using the platform is also a continuous effort.
In addition, there is a constant will to make the tools more efficient and attractive.




B4.2 Testimonials from end-users

Nick Pidgeon, Cardiff University

We have been using the 2050 Pathways Analysis tool (in fact the My2050 Calculators) in academic

research activities that are investigating how people would respond and whether they will be willing to
accept changes in energy planning. This research is part of a 20m GBP project titled “Public Acceptance
                            92
of Whole-Energy System”       and funded by the UK Energy Research Centre. At the beginning of the
project the research team needed a tool to generate future scenarios and has decided to adopt the

2050 tool as it was in place and has showed quite good results. The main decision taken was to utilise
the my2050 version of the toolkit, as it is more illustrative and user friendly and more appropriate for
                                                                       93
the general population. As stated in the briefing note of this project , the my2050 tool is a unique and
useful tool for engaging members of the public around energy futures and energy transitions. It offers a

positive basis for engagement focused on solutions, rather than problems, while the basis for it, the
pathways calculator, is found to be too technical for use with non- specialists within the field of energy

systems.

In the frame of the project, different workshops were held where the tool was used in order to
generate future scenarios in order to investigate then their acceptance by people. One key aspect that
was found as missing from the my2050 tool is “Cost”, although it is clearly a very important factor

when discussing energy futures. People want to know about cost and cost implications of various
choices. Following the workshops, a big survey has been carried out, with over 2.000 people taking

part. This was also based on the toolkit, however the project team worked heavily on the selection of
people in order to create a representative set of the society, which is not the actual case in the original

2050 Pathways Analysis, as it is open to the public and there is no evidence whether the people
participating are forming a representative set of the UK population. At the end of the studies, the

results will be presented to the UK regional and national governments, as policy makers are heavily
interested in the outcomes of this research.

Summing up, the model seems as a very interesting and quite accurate one regarding the realistic

generation of scenarios and is ideal for a number of studies.

1. Rationale

Question 1.1 - What was the motivation/justification to design, develop and deploy the case? Which

needs of policy makers are you addressing? How is your case linked to the policy cycle? Was it based
on previous work/project or did you start it as a new initiative? Who were the initiators of the
initiative?


The initial motivation for GLEAM was a research question of public health concern “can we do
forecasting regarding the global spreading of diseases”. With forecast we do not mean to predict when

the next pandemic will strike (or what it will be), but, given the fact that the World Health Organisation
(WHO) or some other agencies, raises some warnings about a cluster of cases of an infectious disease,
be able to provide a forecasting infrastructure for its geographical and time spreading. This concept is

quite similar to create a weather forecast.
The main starting point was based on research to develop the algorithms, collect the needed data, etc.,

and from 2003-4 till 2008-9 the team was occupied with the creation of the basic computational model
that integrates all the data. GLEAM integrates data from census agencies, data regarding where people
live at very high resolutions by the Socio-Economic Data and Application Center (SEDAC) that estimates

population with a granularity given by a lattice of cells covering the whole planet at a resolution of 5x5
miles, 99% of the global air travels, about 40 databases from different countries for local mobility,

commuting, transfer, etc.
All this data has to be integrated into the model that simulates the spreading of the diseases. This is



                                            Page 89 of 180
                                  0313F02_Case studies on specific applications of ICT solutions for policy modelling




just the engine of GLEAM. In 2009 the team was working with agencies and private companies for

analysing the H1N1 pandemic. We realised it was difficult to communicate large amount of data to
stakeholders as you don’t know what people are really interested in and at the same time modification

questions are constantly popping up in order to calibrate the model for studying different issues. So we
decided to create a computational infrastructure (GLEAMviz) that, using in the background GLEAM,
allowed us to setup any model in case of an emergency and to do almost the same heavy calibration

that we do in a supercomputer environment, and also to make this data available for exploration
through a visual interface to agencies and people who could try to change the model’s parameters, try

different containment measures, etc. without coming back to the GLEAM team for needs of support.
Also we decided to have something public that can be used for academic use to teach large-scale

infectious diseases spread modelling without being forced to implement the engine. The public version
does not contain all features of the full platform.
Regarding the Policy Cycle, GLEAM is targeting mostly the middle steps of this, namely policy design

and implementation phases, as it aims to forecast and identify how disease are spreading in order to
allow decision makers to design policies and deploy policy measures.



Question 1.2 - What was your funding source at the beginning? How did you manage to get this
funding? Which stakeholders have been involved? What is your case’s business model at the

moment?

The research team started at the beginning working on the project and then after some time it started

looking for funding and projects willing to sponsor the attempt. Initially the work performed in areas
such as computational epidemiology, disease spreading on networks etc. was funded as part of
scientific research, but not as part of the GLEAM project. Once the idea was more concrete, we got

funding from US agencies (NIH, Defense Threat Reduction Agency), the EC through some projects
(EPIWORK IP project and EPIFOR). In the website (www.gleamviz.org) there is the list of all funders.

Also funding is coming from 2 major corporations (cannot disclose name).
At this time, the case is supported through funding for new features. EPIWORK funding is used to
expand the functionality of the platform, to provide APIs to introduce specific agent based model

within the existing model, to integrate the platform with another epidemic data sharing platform that is
constructed in EPIWORK. There are many research areas that allow us to keep the platform alive and

still do development. Another part of the funding comes from research contracts, from corporations
that want to use the platform for their epidemic preparation plans (e.g. to evaluate the number of
workers within an area that could get infected).



Question 1.3 – Describe the different deployments of your initiative/case. Where is it deployed?

What are the themes/topics of interest? Is it in experimental mode or fully operational? What is the
role of various stakeholders involved?

There are many deployments, including the US Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), undisclosed

corporations and agencies like the EC JRC that uses GLEAM in its Crisis Management Unit. The
collaboration with JRC started during H1N1 pandemic and at that point the GLEAMviz tool was not

available but now the agency is getting the full computational infrastructure. Moreover there are also

                                0313F02_Case studies on specific applications of ICT solutions for policy modelling





contacts with other agencies, such as the CDC, ECDC, WHO, etc. on a collaborative side.


2. Implementation


Question 2.1 - Which specific methodologies/approaches were used? How were they selected? What
is the expertise required of the research team involved and how is the interaction with users

addressed? Are policy makers involved in the implementation as users?

The expertise required in the research team is very interdisciplinary, so we have people coming from
physics, computer science, mathematical biology, public health institutes, graphic designers for the

interface, and HCI experts. You have to have a multidisciplinary team and create a common vision and
goal, which is quite difficult in terms of unifying languages, skills, understanding of each other, and

different way of work.
People from JRC have been providing feedback and can be considered the first link to policy making

and we have been talking a lot with policy makers from agencies that are providing feedback. Now one
of the developers is working at INSERM (National Institute for Heath in France). So the end users have
been involved in the loop.

GLEAM touches the following Research Challenges of CROSSOVER:
       Policy Modelling

            o  Collaborative Modelling
            o  Model Validation

            o  Immersive Simulation
            o  Output Analysis and Knowledge Synthesis

       Data-powered Collaborative Governance
            o  Visual Analytics
            o  Open Governmental Data

            o  Big Data



Question 2.2 - How long have you been running the platform/system? How many major updates
have you implemented and what was the reason for these, if any? What specific technologies/ tools

were used? Were they open source/ free/ commercial? Are there any other technologies you are
planning to deploy?

The 1 release of the platform was in 2010 and now we are at the 3 year of the full release. There

have been 4 major releases (now we are in the GLEAMViz 4.0) and the major changes were on
improving visualisation and capabilities. Moreover, the last release has a different engine for the

simulation that is 10x faster and in total about dozen releases. 3-4 updates every year.
The platform is open and the software too. Commercial software has been used only for development

like Adobe Air for the client (needs licencing for developers), but for the end user it is free. However we
have a public release, which does not have all the features of the software, and the full software is
released only to specific agencies (like the JRC) that are in a position to install and maintain the

software on their server. For several reasons we cannot offer the full model to all users, as for example
we cannot directly support 20 or 50 installation and therefore support is only provided to major


                                            Page 91 of 180
                                  0313F02_Case studies on specific applications of ICT solutions for policy modelling




agencies that are running the full model. Moreover the full release runs on HPC that we provide to the

community so we cannot allow every user to use all the features, as we would need a super-computing
centre, which is not feasible at the moment.



Question 2.3 - Which are the policy/simulation/computational models you are using to support the
platform/system? Can other models replace them, or is the platform/system built entirely on their

operations/ input-outputs? What kind of data do you use for your cases (open data/big data/public
sector data/private date/etc.)? How are you handling them?


The GLEAM research team develops the model. The tool is a unique model. We are the only group with
global capabilities at this time in terms of epidemic modelling. We are planning to create APIs and
collaborate with other 2 groups to create an integration of the GLEAM model with localised agent

based models which are much more detailed and will bring in the platform other computational models
too.

The tool allows people to create their own models and simulate them through the GLEAM platform, so
anyone can construct his own model with different parameters.
The data used for the tool is mostly public data, but when talking about specific implementations like a

pandemic plan for a big corporation, then the tool integrates data from these organisations that are
not public and cannot be publicly shared. Moreover, the tool also integrates commercial data, like the

IATA data, the OAG database, and data from various census bureaus. This data is only used for
computations and cannot be redistributed through the tool. Everything else that can be accessed

through the tool (like world population data, etc.) is publicly available in various sources.
The website has also a library of models (4-5 models available) and this will be enlarged by a future
release (to 10-12 models) but the GUI allows to design your own models on a drag and drop canvas.



3. Results Achieved and Impact

Question 3.1 - What are the main results achieved by the case/initiative? What are the key indicators

of the project/ initiative (either impact-oriented or operation/ technology-oriented)? How were they
selected/ developed? Were/ Are they met?


The    number      of   active    users   is   above     100.    However     many     user    accounts
are      from      institutional    laboratories,     Universities.     Thus      they      correspond
to multiple individual users.



Question 3.2 - What is the impact achieved (or expected) of the project/ initiative both overall and

per stakeholder group? Who were the stakeholders/ stakeholder groups involved / served? How (if)
is the case been used in practice to support policy making?

Τhe main results of GLEAM so far were the production of the forecast for the H1N1 pandemic that was
                                                                            th
quite successful. A validation paper that will be published in December 13 , 2012 will showcase that
the GLEAM predictions were quite spot on.

The main stakeholders that are using the software and support their policy-making procedures are the

                                             Page 92 of 180
                                   0313F02_Case studies on specific applications of ICT solutions for policy modelling




DTRA, the JRC, and the corporations that are using the software.



Question 3.3 - Which is the core innovation of your project / initiative? Has your case been

recognised by policy makers? If so, to what extent? How has it been incorporated in long/short term
policy making by decision makers?

The core innovation of GLEAM lies within the computational model which can integrate data from

various sources and provide a forecast on the spread of epidemics on a global level, which was not
possible before.

Moreover, through the visual interface users are in a position to create their own models and
investigate specific diseases and issues that they are interested in.
JRC is using the tool in its long strategy, starting with the H1N1 disease.



4. Challenges encountered and lessons learned


Question 4.1 - What are the key lessons learned? Which were the key success factors and drivers that
enabled positive developments?

The first lesson learned is that the use of Web2.0 technologies for the policy-making domain is not an

easy task, as policy makers are not used to work with these tools. There is some scepticism or in some
other cases too much trust. These computational tools are quantitative but policy making cannot be

done solely by looking at the numbers. What needs to happen is to complement the policy making
process with this quantitative information but not to disregard neither to underestimate the value of
such information, because behind each model there are assumptions, modelling compromises, missing

data, etc.
Also more and accurate more data is needed. Policy making used to work with data not suited for

quantitative use. This way you might end up with very rough statistics that are not proper for precise
calculations. The same applies for forecasting; the better data you have, the better and more accurate
the forecast will be, while with very poor data you might get a very disturbed picture of the future. So

one needs to deal with how we can improve and create a culture in the policymaking environment for
real-time high quality data. It is also surprising that we have satellites for weather, but there is no map

for human mobility (so in the case of GLEAM we had to create it from scratch). The technology was
there but not used to get his data. People in the policy making environment need to learn that those
data can provide an edge to the decision making process.

The major key success factor has been the fact that we were good enough with the H1N1 pandemic
predictions, while working in real time, which helped to build a dialogue with the policy makers,

starting a trust relationship.
Of course success means providing something that no one else can provide. There are many groups

working in different levels (local/regional/country) and we went into a global level, not reinventing the
wheel but specialising and providing different things.






                                               Page 93 of 180
                                  0313F02_Case studies on specific applications of ICT solutions for policy modelling




Question 4.2 - What are the main drawbacks of your case and the barriers you faced during

implementation?

The main drawback in our case had to do with the sustainability problem. The research effort so far has

sustained the tool, but at a certain point policy makers shall understand that they should provide
funding for maintaining these ICT computational tools for policymakers, as it is happening with other
product. Only few agencies (from the big ones) have small crisis management units that can maintain

such tools. Big agencies do not have a computational or modelling unit and this requires a change of
culture from the institution and the agencies.



Question 4.3 - Which recommendations would you provide based on the experience gained in your
case? Which risks have you identified and should be taken under consideration? How to overcome

the barriers faced?

A first recommendation will be to build into the agencies units that can deploy, operate and further

develop such tools. Agencies should use people that work in this research projects and let them lead
inter-agency for moving the tools to the new level within these organisations and focus on the issues
they need to tackle.

Moreover, as we have watched that tools and Web2.0 technologies are being replicated easily, one
should aim at integrating different tools and methods in an effort to help to do a better policymaking.

We have seen that with the US storm Sandy, 20 models were on use and you could see different
dimensions, but the models were converging in similar results. So it is a matter of creating different
models that converge to similar results, so we can trust even more the results of the tools.

Moreover, there is a real need for creating and sharing high quality data in real time.



5. Sustainability

Question 5.1 - Was there any specific stakeholder engagement strategy so as to gain visibility and
'buy-in'? Did you manage a steady increase of participating users, or was there a peak due to a

special event?

Initially there was not such strategy as the community of epidemic modelling and computation tools is

pretty small. The major stakeholders have been contacted during conferences, workshops, etc. It was
the H1N1 pandemic which brought many people to the platform and then the tool has been
disseminated by word of mouth based on the other usage scenarios.

At this time we are actively participating in conferences and meetings to present the tools. Moreover
other material has been/is being created, such as short movies, brochures, and advertisement events.

We have also a component called “Epidemic Planet” that is exhibited in museums to attract audience.
In this context we try to push the tool into the education environment to facilitate students to learn
more about epidemic spreading and global diseases to make the younger generation more familiar with

the tool and the project.

                                   0313F02_Case studies on specific applications of ICT solutions for policy modelling




Question 5.2 - Do you think that your case/tools could be applied in other domains? If yes, please

name them and discuss the possible changes that would be required.



GLEAM has been developed to model disease spreading. The basic contagion process involved has clear

biological roots that allow simple modelization. Other types of contagion instead, as for example
knowledge diffusion, and adoption of a convention or a product, have a completely different nature

and are much more difficult to threat. One of the possible, ambitious, extensions of our framework is
its application in these different domains tackling a broad range of contagion processes



Question 5.3 - What are your future plans/ steps regarding the case/initiative?

Our future plans include improvements and enrichments regarding the tool.

Moreover, so far we have been working on human infection diseases. We hope to extend the model
considering also vector born diseases (like malaria) that require also the modeling of vectors such as
mosquitos. In this context the tool can be surely used for other issues as well.

Another direction is to move into other areas of contagion, so to deal not only with infectious diseases,
but also work with knowledge Information for other epidemiological concepts. Moreover we plan to

include more data and models in the platform and depending on the resolution and the needs of the
users to create different ways to investigate the evolution of the epidemic. The basic idea is to use

social media like Twitter, etc. to raise a flag when the signal of a potential disease is detected, and then
run the simulations to test its possible impact. This will allow using the tool also for early detection also
for different phenomena. But this is a task for the next 5-10 years.



B4.2 Testimonials from end-users


Nikolaos Stilianakis, JRC

GLEAMviz is a tool covering epidemics at a global level. It is pretty sophisticated and one of the best
tools around, however as it happens with most modelling tools the user has to understand what is
going on in the model in order to use it. Moreover, the tool is not a simulation tool for every kind of

disease but it is used specifically for fast spreading epidemics where the transportation plays a big role.
It can be used as a prevention tool for planning and preparing by running scenarios, but it has to be

noted that it is mainly used for global scope diseases, not small, local level outbreaks.

In this context, it is a good and valuable tool for a policy maker who understands how epidemics work
and has a scientific background on the field so he can interpret the results correctly. This is a fact for
almost all modelling tools, as they are all based on assumptions and one has to understand how these

underlying models work. So an administrator in a National Public Health Institution, at a EU level or in
the Commission has to have some scientists supporting him to use the tool in the proper manner.

The JRC has used the tool during various fast-spreading diseases (in collaboration with the GLEAM team

in Torino), and has communicated the results to the DG SANCO’s unit working the emerging public
heath threats, which took them under consideration.JRC has the full version of the tool installed (not

simulation if needed or upon request by DG SANCO for instance.

In France, several epidemiological models have been deployed, but these mostly targeted threads on a

national level (so within the country) and not on an international level. The GLEAM model has thus
been employed but in most cases, as various institutes are only stuffed by doctors, medical stuff,

epidemiologists or policy makers, there is a need for physicists and computer engineers to deploy the
model and operate the toolkit.

                                                                                        94
Based on this need, a new attempt has been initiated under the HarMS-flu project in order to be able
to adapt the GLEAM model on a country level and ease out the complexity of modelling so that it will
be utilised by policy makers and medical stuff directly. More specifically, quoting from its website, “the

HarMS-flue project brings together modellers, developers, medical doctors, epidemiologists, and public
health professionals in order to: (i) collect, analyse and understand hosts interactions and behaviours at

different scales and under different conditions (e.g. during an epidemic or in the absence of it), as well
as epidemiological data; (ii) formulate theoretical approaches and develop computational frameworks

for the harmonization of the different scales at play, informed by the data collected, and assess their
predictive power; and (iii) develop a data-driven multi-scale computational platform, integrating the

data and modelling knowledge acquired in the previous directions of the project, for the simulation of
an infectious disease spread and possible interventions”

Going back to GLEAM, what is quite difficult to achieve in order to operate such a model successfully is

the fact that the user needs to feed the model with a huge amount of accurate facts and data that need
to be estimated correctly. Moreover, once this is done, the next difficult task is to interpret the results

in a correct manner and to convey them in the most appropriate manner to high-level policy makers so
that they understand their importance. In order to overcome this difficulty, it is important to go step by

step and side by side with policy makers over the whole modelling cycle, so that they understand first-
hand the basic ingredients and philosophy of the model, what the model can produce ad which are the

limitations that the model has.

Moreover there is a need to bring on board also other modellers for collaboration and for sharing data
resources in order to further extend the model and its applicability and there is a need to construct
                                    95
emergency centres like the ECDC . Also empirical data should be compared to the GLEAM outputs in
order to see whether they converge and this will help researchers to study how to input specific data

that may improve the predictions. This could be also boosted by the creation of a data sharing platform
where people could upload datasets and share them with the community. This will help to develop a

more streamlined process to link the model with other real-time input data and will allow a more
dynamic validation mechanisms using also empirical data.

GLEAM is definitely one of the most developed software tools in its category; actually, for this kind of

product, there is actually not much competition.

One of the most interesting parts of GLEAM is the very detailed airline transportation model that they
have; something difficult and expensive. In addition, GLEAM is efficient and user friendly as a piece of

software itself (e.g. user interface, graphic design). Moreover, GLEAM as a product is better than others
in terms of outreach; the GLEAM team has performed effectively towards this direction.

GLEAM could apply to all kinds of diseases and epidemics. It is configurable and capable of doing so.

The model can be altered and/ or updated by the end user pretty easily. Although there is no personal
experience in using GLEAM with policy makers, there definitely exists utilization of GLEAM in terms of
European research (e.g. FP7 projects). Alternative uses of GLEAM would be teaching in universities;

even high school students can easily use it and learn from it.

As future steps, collaborations with public administrations and/ or NGOs could be envisioned, in order
to achieve great results in terms of public health and relative application. In addition, in case things are

not too tightly coupled, the visualisation component –GLEAMViz- could be a stand-alone piece of
software.

B.3 Opinion Space 3.0


B3.1 Interview with Case Project Team

The interview regarding the Opinion Space 3.0 case took place through teleconference infrastructure

(Skype) on Friday 30/11/2012 at 08:00 CET.

The attendees of the meeting were the following:

Opinion Space 3.0 Team


       Sanjay Krishnan - sanjaykrishn@gmail.com

CROSSOVER Team

       Gianluca Misuraca – gianluca.misuraca@ec.europa.eu

       Francesco Mureddu - francesco.mureddu@tech4i2.com

1. Rationale

Question 1.1 - What was the motivation/justification to design, develop and deploy the case? Which
needs of policy makers are you addressing? How is your case linked to the policy cycle? Was it based

on previous work/project or did you start it as a new initiative? Who were the initiators of the
initiative?

Initially, we wanted to bring the world of big data to brainstorming (the process of generating ideas):

how can we take advantage of the world of big data in the process of generating ideas. Can algorithms
and statistical techniques (that worked well in other areas, such as robotics) operate towards this

direction?
After the election of President Obama, the government had a social media orientation, which provided
fertile ground for the first trigger case.

Opinion Space was based on a few prior projects that dealt with: (i) recommending NPOs to people so
as to donate, (ii) a job recommendation system (background recommendation systems in general). The
combination of recommendation systems and visualisation was the main trigger behind Opinion Space.

Policy makers need to know what the population they serve thinks; and this is definitely a complicated
problem. Surveys are not the solution; they can be communicated to a certain number of people and

need processing. They need to be able to take a quick “snapshot” of what people think. That’s the need
that Opinion Space solves.
Opinion Space can be seen definitely as belonging to Agenda Setting phase of the Policy Making cycle.

Nevertheless, it can also be used in order to evaluate policies and actions. Therefore, it also fits in the
Monitor and Evaluate phase.

Question 1.2 - What was your funding source at the beginning? How did you manage to get this

funding? Which stakeholders have been involved? What is your case’s business model at the
moment?


Opinion Space has been based on a mix of funding grants (e.g. NSF grants). In addition, every individual
project has also received some industry funding.
Typically the way that individual implementations work is through initial contacts that lead to

implementation; there are no contracts in the business sense. It’s more like the fund Opinion Space in
order to view the results of this kind of research in their domains (e.g. Fujitsu funded Opinion Space in

order to see the results of sentiment analysis on e-learning).


Question 1.3 – Describe the different deployments of your initiative/case. Where is it deployed?

What are the themes/topics of interest? Is it in experimental mode or fully operational? What is the
role of various stakeholders involved?


The first two projects (in 2009) were with the US State Department. Then, by generalising the system,
we worked with the US auto-maker, with an insurance company, an HR department in UniLever (what
employees thought about various policy decisions in the company), in various academia-oriented

questions, in local state measures (e.g. California) etc.
Opinion Space is fully operational in its current state. Nevertheless, as a research platform it still

remains experimental. The great amount of data is very structured and this helps towards continuing
research on text analysis, statistical modelling etc.



2. Implementation

Question 2.1 - Which specific methodologies/approaches were used? How were they selected? What

is the expertise required of the research team involved and how is the interaction with users
addressed? Are policy makers involved in the implementation as users?

Opinion Space uses a technique in order to project a five-dimension (up to eight-dimension) space in

the two-dimension space. This is used in order to visualise diversity, which is critical for the purposes of
Opinion Space. This technique was selected because it is established in other domains, such as robotics.

Visual analogue slider is also used in the frames of Opinion Space in order to give users the ability to
rate in a continuous manner and not in a binary one (like / dislike).
Thus, mathematical, mathematical modelling, industrial and artificial intelligence background can be

found in the members of the Opinion Space team. Design groups and human-computers interaction
groups were also consulted.

Policy makers are directly involved. They make their questions but they always need our assistance.
The Opinion Space team involvement is not necessary, but it actually makes the system operate in a
better way. They are also involved in the course of the development: the development is modular and

they provide feedback in every step. In this way they also provide initial ideas and they get familiar with
the whole system.

We have identified as potential challenges touched by Opinion Space the following:


                                              Page 99 of 180

       Policy Modelling

o       Collaborative Modelling
o       Easy Access to Information and Knowledge Creation

o       Output Analysis and Knowledge Synthesis
       Data-powered Collaborative Governance

o       Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis
o       Visual Analytics
o       Open Governmental Data



Question 2.2 - How long have you been running the platform/system? How many major updates

have you implemented and what was the reason for these, if any? What specific technologies/ tools
were used? Were they open source/ free/ commercial? Are there any other technologies you are
planning to deploy?


Opinion Space has been running since 2009. Besides 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 (current version), there were
various unnamed versions of the initiative (mostly based on the 3.0 code).

Version 1.0 basically just visualised diversity and it was not really an idea generation platform. In
version 2.0 we tried to capture and visualise the user interaction and the main innovation introduced
was the ranking system; users could evaluate each other’s ideas. In version 3.0 the ideas was to make

the whole platform user centric. We incorporated ideas from human-computer interaction into the
platform. Another innovation was the introduction of more and more sophisticated statistical tools.

After that the main focus was on increasing traffic.
In addition, there is an additional moderator space for policy makers. It gives them a wrap-up of the top
ideas and allows them to change ideas etc.

Opinion Space primarily uses open source software. However, Opinion Space’s licence is assigned to
the university.

Specific technologies and tools include a web application that hooks up to a database analytic system (a
relational database to be more specific, as a lot of the available data is extremely structured) through

middleware. The UI is a flash-based interface and the statistical platform is Python-based. Opinion
Space also incorporates techniques from deliberative polling, collaborative filtering, statistical
inference, and dimensionality reduction.



Question 2.3 - Which are the policy/simulation/computational models you are using to support the

platform/system? Can other models replace them, or is the platform/system built entirely on their
operations/ input-outputs? What kind of data do you use for your cases (open data/big data/public
sector data/private date/etc.)? How are you handling them?


Opinion Space’s techniques can be easily applied to other sets of existing open data.

3. Results Achieved and Impact


Question 3.1 - What are the main results achieved by the case/initiative? What are the key indicators
of the project/ initiative (either impact-oriented or operation/ technology-oriented)? How were they
selected/ developed? Were/ Are they met?


One of the first and main indicators was the participation rate; users that arrive in the platform for the
first time and those that become active participants. People that arrive in websites are always more

than those who actually participate (in some projects the rate was close to 50% and in others around
10%).

In the State Department instance, more than 2000 different ideas were collected (about US foreign
policy). In addition, more than 5000 individual responses were collected. It cannot be said whether the
final decisions were based on some of the ideas provided, but a detailed report was provided to the

policy makers. The project with a US auto-maker (targeted towards recognising ways of improving their
image) resulted to about 1000 ideas and about 100.000 ratings evaluating these ideas (e.g. more

specifically they talked about green vehicles).


Question 3.2 - What is the impact achieved (or expected) of the project/ initiative both overall and

per stakeholder group? Who were the stakeholders/ stakeholder groups involved / served? How (if)
is the case been used in practice to support policy making?


To Opinion Space’s understanding, the results exceeded even the optimistic expectations, taking into
consideration that the target groups are specific and limited in most of the implementations. If the
cases targeted towards vast amounts of open public, the goal was not met. But in terms of specific

target groups, they exceeded expectations.



Question 3.3 - Which is the core innovation of your project / initiative? Has your case been
recognised by policy makers? If so, to what extent? How has it been incorporated in long/short term
policy making by decision makers?


One of the core innovations and successes of Opinion Space is the very fast way to browse (and rate)
amongst a large number of ideas (even if this is a visualisation-oriented innovation). From the scientific

point of view, the greatest innovation was bringing statistical analysis in structured discussion/ data.
One of the best endorsements was Hillary Clinton’s reference to Opinion Space. Other endorsements
include high level officers of collaborating companies.

As far as the Opinion Space team knows, Opinion Space has not yet been incorporated in any formal
decision making procedures. The State Department, however, uses “informally” Opinion Space in order

to get ideas and opinions on specific policies.

                                   0313F02_Case studies on specific applications of ICT solutions for policy modelling




4. Challenges encountered and lessons learned


Question 4.1 - What are the key lessons learned? Which were the key success factors and drivers that
enabled positive developments?

The first and main lesson learnt is that the slightest effort needed by the user really affects

participation; everything needs to be easy and user friendly. For example, by increasing the start-
questions from 5 to 8, participation decreased almost 50%. In addition, we learnt more about machine

learning techniques and algorithms and their capabilities and sensitivities.
From the policy makers point of view (State Department to be more specific) they learned that ideas

can be very diverse and scattered; and many times this is neglected by media and press.


Question 4.2 - What are the main drawbacks of your case and the barriers you faced during

implementation?



The Opinion Space platform performs a lot of actions so maybe a lighter version should be considered.

In terms of policy makers, many concerns on privacy have been raised; different regulations regarding
data make things complex. In addition, when introducing a new concept/ technology, users might be

reluctant in using it. Last but not least, the choice to implement the platform on Flash has led to loss of
all Apple-devices users.



Question 4.3 - Which recommendations would you provide based on the experience gained in your
case? Which risks have you identified and should be taken under consideration? How to overcome

the barriers faced?

First of all, when you apply social media systems in such procedures you always need the lightest
application possible, which works across all platforms (operating systems, mobile devices) and is easily

set and operated.
Regarding Opinion Space, the platform works particularly well when you apply it to a specific use case

or/ and a well formulated idea.
In terms of risks, two principal risks can be identified: (i) implementation – the result might not be the

desired or requested one, (ii) not well structured ideas/ questions (e.g. what is the meaning of life) may
wh or inability to refer to the proper audience may result to failure in participation.

5. Sustainability


Question 5.1 - Was there any specific stakeholder engagement strategy so as to gain visibility and
'buy-in'? Did you manage a steady increase of participating users, or was there a peak due to a
special event?


First of all, Opinion Space can trigger/ invite users of other/ older cases to participate in new ones. The
“core” users of Opinion Space are about a couple of hundreds.

In addition, the Opinion Space team uses Google adwords, SEO and sends emails to relative emailing
lists.

The increase of users really depends on the timing, as well as on how interested are people about the
specific subject under consideration.



Question 5.2 - Do you think that your case/tools could be applied in other domains? If yes, please
name them and discuss the possible changes that would be required.

Opinion Space is technically capable of handling any kind of question. Any brainstorming/ idea

generation project in any kind of organization can by supported.



Question 5.3 - What are your future plans/ steps regarding the case/initiative?

First of all, there is a continuous effort to make the platform easier and more user friendly. We are
working on a lighter Opinion Space without the initial five questions; it will just ask the user to

comments and his/ her comments will be evaluated. In addition, we are working on a “global” version
of Opinion Space based on HTML, which will work across any platform.

In terms of research, we are working on machine learning techniques that can help dealing with larger
amounts of data. Moreover, amelioration of algorithms is also a continuous research theme.

There is also a plan of collaborating with the State Department once again. In addition, independent
projects come up in the course of time.

B.4 UrbanSim


B4.1 Interview with Case Project Team

1. Rationale

Question 1.1 - What was the motivation/justification to design, develop and deploy the case? Which
needs of policy makers are you addressing? How is your case linked to the policy cycle? Was it based

on previous work/project or did you start it as a new initiative? Who were the initiators of the
initiative?

UrbanSim is a project based mostly on a software platform being developed quite a few years now. In

the mid 1990’s (when UrbanSim was first conceived) the original motivation was to interact in the
policy analysis domain at the metropolitan scale principally around the issues of transportation and

land use, but also environmental planning. The context was initially only USA with the metropolitan
planning organisations of each area, which are the legally mandated organisations to undertake
regional transportation planning and to funnel federal funds for transportation projects dealing with

this matter.
The challenge that UrbanSim was initially trying to address was the shortcoming in analytical capacity
of Metropolitan Planning Organisations (MPOs); they were unable to effectively analyse the secondary

or cumulative impacts of transportation investments (e.g. new highways, highway widening, rail transit)
on urban development (e.g. where new housing gets developed). The consequence of this limitation

was that there was a significant bias towards overestimating the benefits of new construction and
highway capacity expansion and this became the basis for a legal challenges, mainly by the
environmental movement (they challenged legally decisions of implementing new construction projects

without considering the long-term impact).
So we designed and implemented the UrbanSim platform as a way to analyse the effects of changes in



                                            Page 104 of 180
                                  0313F02_Case studies on specific applications of ICT solutions for policy modelling




the transport system on urban development (travel patterns, effectiveness of transport projects.

Regarding the Policy Cycle, the project probably fits in the Policy Design and Implementation phase
Nevertheless, motivation has evolved over the years. It still maintains the core of allowing analysis of

secondary/ accumulated effects of transport-related investments, but now more broadly encompasses
the desire of many local and regional planning policy makers to assess the impacts of land use policies
(e.g. in California there is legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions not only by changing types of

fuels/ vehicles; the law calls also for MPOs to coordinate with local cities to change land use patterns in
ways that reduce the need to travel by car). So, based on this agenda, UrbanSim now deals with

evaluating packages of measures of various policies that include examining building codes, incentives,
impact, different policies etc. At this time, UrbanSim has a portfolio of transfer-related projects but also

land use policies. Thus, the motivations have broadened in the course of time.
More recently, increased interest has been noted in analyzing policies that relate to portable housing,
equity and economic development. In addition, increased interest has been shown in public

engagement in decision making processes/ policy design (e.g. recent project in San Francisco area
aiming to develop a 3D visualisation system that would complement UrbanSim in providing capacity for

community residents and local planners to be able to visualize alternative scenarios and have a
stronger intuition around what these alternatives might look like in terms of their impact on urban
development over the next 30 years).

The initial idea came after a long literature review mostly on urban economics, micro-simulation and
GISs. The software platform itself was developed from scratch.



Question 1.2 - What was your funding source at the beginning? How did you manage to get this
funding? Which stakeholders have been involved? What is your case’s business model at the

moment?

The very initial funding was from a consulting project in order to design and develop and urban

simulation model of the Honolulu MPO, Subsequently, a National Science Foundation grant was
obtained (for an urban research initiative) which led to a substantial increase in the research on how to
approach such a complex simulation and policy analysis platform. The initial findings led to several

more grants from NSF (probably 6 different – over 10.000.000$ in total). In addition, an EU FP7 project
called “Sustain City” (www.sustaincity.eu) has brought some funding.

Nevertheless, most of the real-life application growth has come from contracts with various MPOs that
have actually used the system.



Question 1.3 – Describe the different deployments of your initiative/case. Where is it deployed?
What are the themes/topics of interest? Is it in experimental mode or fully operational? What is the

role of various stakeholders involved?

There have been a lot of deployments including USA, Europe and Africa. It has to be noted that the
experience in the US is very different than in Europe (and also other international applications).

The main difference is that UrbanSim has been actively involved in developing the applications in close
collaboration with NPOs in US and has moved from a research to an applied context (they are actually

platform), while in Europe we had a modest advisory role, we provided some innovations in terms of

access to software/ algorithm/ models improvements but most of the work is being done by research
teams scattered throughout Europe and the government agencies have not been active partners and

much time has been devoted on doing research that the participating research teams were interested
in, but with less engagement of the actual planning agencies.
The reason behind this lack of collaboration in the European case is not clear. Maybe due to the need

for immediate innovation relevant to EU context. The two main limitation of the project deployment in
the EU were: (i) not having active PA partners from the very beginning of the project and (ii) the

difficulties caused by the new users of UrbanSim that had not interacted with the platform before and
were not experienced in developing models, calibrating them, adding data etc.



2. Implementation

Question 2.1 - Which specific methodologies/approaches were used? How were they selected? What

is the expertise required of the research team involved and how is the interaction with users
addressed? Are policy makers involved in the implementation as users?

In terms of methodologies, UrbanSim uses preliminary data analysis to organize an integrated

UrbanSim data system (data fusion or data integration methodology), behavioral models, metric
models, regression models, free choice models and equilibrating dynamics. Most recently

methodologies for community engagement have been used (though a visual environment in which
users can compare side by side two different propositions. In terms of technologies, free choice
modeling can be also considered as a technology, technologies for analyzing uncertainty, techniques for

validating models, technologies for 3D urban modelling.
We have identified as potential challenges touched by URBASIM the following:

       Policy Modelling
o       Systems of Atomized Models

o       Immersive Simulation
       Data-powered Collaborative Governance
o       Big Data

o       Visual Analytics
UrbanSim has a quite multi-disciplinary team: PhD holders in computer science, computer graphics,

urban planning, transportation planning and modelling, civil engineering, urban real estate design and
development and finance. We are also collaborating with people that are experts in community

engagement and participation.
Policy makers are definitely involved in the implementation, especially in the US cases. When applied
projects with planning organizations are implemented, the users are active participants in the whole

process (even from the research part). Planners and analysts from the PAs are actively involved in what
UrbanSim calls “agile modeling”. UrbanSim follows a very modular approach that allows the team to

reconfigure and add any necessary part of the model, due to the fact that the model may alter
dramatically amongst various application cases. Policy makers are also involved in monthly iterations
where they use and test the model under development and provide feedback. This helps not only in

terms of feedback, but also in terms of the policy makers getting familiar with the model and platform.

                                  0313F02_Case studies on specific applications of ICT solutions for policy modelling




Question 2.2 - How long have you been running the platform/system? How many major updates

have you implemented and what was the reason for these, if any? What specific technologies/ tools
were used? Were they open source/ free/ commercial? Are there any other technologies you are

planning to deploy?

The first platform implementation was in Java. In 2005 a decision was taken in order to re-implement it
in Python. Most recently (in the last year), a new extension of UrbanSim has been developed,

UrbanVision, which is a 3D urban visualisation and supports also editing scenario analysis.
Initially, UrbanSim was available as an open source license downloadable from the web for more than

10 years. UrbanVision and some additional extensions are implemented in a new platform in C++.
Those were decided to be distributed as closed source, with very differential pricing for public agencies,
private agencies, educational/ research institutes etc. The decision was taken mostly due to

competition from commercial entities.



Question 2.3 - Which are the policy/simulation/computational models you are using to support the
platform/system? Can other models replace them, or is the platform/system built entirely on their
operations/ input-outputs? What kind of data do you use for your cases (open data/big data/public

sector data/private date/etc.)? How are you handling them?

With the modularity followed in UrbanSim, different configurations for any models can be created and

the used is taught how to change those configurations (e.g. change a residential location model with
another). However, the user community is very diverse in an interest and technical background level.
The number of users that actually want to go deep into the models is relatively small. We also provide

support towards any UrbanSim-related activity.
As far as the data as concerned: in the past, the agencies have typically been very protective of their

data. Some data (the minority of them) were indeed legally protected/ confidential/ proprietary (in
various senses), while the majority was open. Yet, authorities were protective with all of them and kept

them in their computers after the completion of the project. What UrbanSim is beginning to do is, both
by working with a university and by developing the proper tool, is to create an online platform in which
we ask from agencies to contribute their data in order to become publicly available and create an API

for access to them. This repository could be used both for research and for the models (having access
to an archive of data is a key factor towards successful models).



3. Results Achieved and Impact

Question 3.1 - What are the main results achieved by the case/initiative? What are the key indicators

of the project/ initiative (either impact-oriented or operation/ technology-oriented)? How were they
selected/ developed? Were/ Are they met?









                                              Page 107 of 180
                                  0313F02_Case studies on specific applications of ICT solutions for policy modelling




Regarding the European case, it can be said that it is not in the same level as the US ones. In the US

there are quite a number of MPOs that actively utilize the UrbanSim platform. The most indicative
application is probably the San Francisco Bay one. The results of the aforementioned case have

involved examining and analyzing five alternative scenarios that required articulating a set of
assumptions about land use policies, transport policies and macro-economic growth (the analysis in
now complete).

In one of them, analyzing visibility of the proposed policy though reverse engineering was attempted,
that made the task much more challenging. The agency has now accepted the results, with

documentation and visualization supporting them.


Question 3.2 - What is the impact achieved (or expected) of the project/ initiative both overall and

per stakeholder group? Who were the stakeholders/ stakeholder groups involved / served? How (if)
is the case been used in practice to support policy making?


In the San Francisco case the 3D visualization system was created in order to attract more citizens. The
intention was to use this system in a number of workshops held in January 2012. User engagement was
intense even from the development/ testing phase. In addition, the public agencies used it in a series of

meetings with community organizations. Each of these meetings had from 15 up to 200 participants
each. The point of these meetings was to communicate the different scenarios to open public and to

get feedback on the preferences of the citizens.
Unfortunately, the visualization was effectively used only in a couple of these meetings; they were

obstructed by the Tea Party movement.


Question 3.3 - Which is the core innovation of your project / initiative? Has your case been

recognised by policy makers? If so, to what extent? How has it been incorporated in long/short term
policy making by decision makers?


One of the most innovative and controversial elements of UrbanSim the combination of various aspects
(named in question 1.1) as well as the “move away” of strong assumptions regarding urban markets
and adopt less strong assumptions (than markets are an equilibrium). For example, the impacts of

transport projects on urban planning are far from being instantaneously realized (in fact they might
evolve over decades. In addition, the capacity of being able to support this less strong assumptions can

also be considered as a core innovation.
The core innovation in the particular case of San Francisco can be found between the following two: (i)
the visualization way of community engagement (UrbanVision component) and (ii) the creation of a

new approach towards modeling real estate development based in pro forma analysis (that enabled
the reverse engineering exercise described in Question 3.1.

The case has definitely been recognized by policy makers and incorporated in their formal procedures.
Thus, it can be said that it has been incorporated in the long term policy making by policy makers of the
San Francisco area.

4. Challenges encountered and lessons learned


Question 4.1 - What are the key lessons learned? Which were the key success factors and drivers that
enabled positive developments?

One of the main key lessons learned from the UrbanSim case has been the fact that there is always an

option to have a balance between academic research (mostly funded by NSF but also others) and real-
life applications towards producing real working systems.

Moreover, when dealing with such applications, it is very important to engage people from the early
steps of the project, in order to get familiar and acquire as much data as possible.



Question 4.2 - What are the main drawbacks of your case and the barriers you faced during
implementation?


Some of the main challenges faced were the very short time frames of the project and having rather
poor data available from agencies to begin the project. In addition, public disruption was another
challenge.

Moreover, having too much software development at the same time was another risk.



Question 4.3 - Which recommendations would you provide based on the experience gained in your
case? Which risks have you identified and should be taken under consideration? How to overcome

the barriers faced?

The first recommendation deals with early engagement; policy makers and end users in general need to
be engaged in the project as soon as possible.

Adequate time for the development of the models and testing of the models is also necessary.
Additionally, finding out a new public engagement strategy, more capable on avoiding public disruption

movements is also advisable (probably through smaller meeting and interaction through the web).


5. Sustainability


Question 5.1 - Was there any specific stakeholder engagement strategy so as to gain visibility and
'buy-in'? Did you manage a steady increase of participating users, or was there a peak due to a
special event?


The agile modeling approach described earlier is part of the stakeholders’ engagement strategy, as well
as early collaborative testing of the model and the visualisation tools.

The stakeholders’ engagement strategy did increase the participation over some months, but
participation spiked during January 2012, when the public meetings took place. After this phase, more
analytical modeling followed, and another round of public engagement took place.



Question 5.2 - Do you think that your case/tools could be applied in other domains? If yes, please

name them and discuss the possible changes that would be required.

                                              Page 109 of 180
                                   0313F02_Case studies on specific applications of ICT solutions for policy modelling





UrbanSim is already exploring transportation and land use domains, as well as urban design.
Environmental issues (e.g. greenhouse gas emissions) were motivation to some projects, so

environmental planning is also quite relevant. Energy consumption or water consumption constitute
interesting issues too. Modelling the impact of climate change (e.g. on weather) is also o topic of
interest. Finally, as also mentioned earlier, economic development/ policies are also under

consideration.



Question 5.3 - What are your future plans/ steps regarding the case/initiative?

The UrbanSim team is currently thinking on how to organize communicating UrbanSim to European

public administrations (and establish and office in Europe as well) and other countries (e.g. Singapore,
Argentina). In addition, we have recently begun expanding our development team and partnerships.

In addition, the online platform in which we ask from agencies to contribute their data if an on-going
effort. Moreover, ameliorating the robustness and generalization of the model is also an ongoing piece
of work. There is also collaboration with academia on big data, based on an NSF grant.






B4.2 Testimonials from end-users

Bilal Farooq, EPFL

Transportation is definitely not an independent entity; it is connected to land usage, energy usage etc.

Thus, it definitely makes sense to model it as a complex interconnected system. The application of this
approach was implemented in the context of the SustainCity research project that took place in Paris,

Brussels and Zurich. Already operating tools (MATSim for transportation and UrbanSim for land usage)
have been selected due to the fact that UrbanSim was heavily advanced on the land use side, but no so
much on the transportation side. UrbanSim was selected after an extensive state of the art desk

research, where it was deduced that it was the most easy to transfer platform.

The UrbanSim models urge for large amounts of data; especially in the Brussels case, the greatest
challenge was to locate, collect and transform in a useful form the necessary (statistic, demographic

etc.) data. In addition, real estate markets, but also transportation systems are rather different in
Europe than in the US. Thus, another challenge was to ascertain that the UrbanSim models were

flexible enough in order to fit the European cities’ needs.

The actual transfer was pretty difficult; the support from and collaboration with the UrbanSim team
was critical in order to achieve the (eventually) strongly positive outcome. Various project partners

performed updates, extensions and advancements in the platform too. The project is now in its final
phase (out of an 18 months initial duration): various simulations (e.g. alternative policy implementation

scenarios) are conducted.

Various stakeholders (e.g. public administrations, consulting companies) are already involved in the

procedure; however, the project is research-oriented. It is unclear whether it will be eventually used or
not.

In terms of lessons learned, the early involvement of decision makers (and all other stakeholders)

proved to be extremely fruitful (especially in the Zurich case). In addition, relevant to the
aforementioned, regular communication between the project team and end users should be

established. Moreover, UrbanSim provides the user with amazing data (large amounts of organised
data); in SustainCity we were not able to fully exploit all these data. In terms of platform, it has to be
supported (from a software point of view) and it also has to be flexible. As far as the 3D visualisations

are concerned, although the were not intensively used in SustainCity, they are considered as highly
useful, especially when dealing with non-experts, in order to help them understand the concept and

the envisioned outcomes.

Annex C – Description of 25 shortlisted cases

Following the first phase of mapping and identification of promising cases, an initial database of 335
practices has been constructed (see Annex D). The analysis of the initial; cases consisted in gathering

basic data and documentation from a number of sources, and examine their relevance to the specific
needs and requirements of ICT for Governance and Policy Modelling. This allowed defining a shortlist of
25 cases that has been further analysed in order to identify the four cases to be selected for in-depth

analysis. For each of the 25 practices identified, various data have been documented, such as the
context of each case, the objectives, the performed activities, the main results and other relevant and

useful material that could contribute or be aligned to the various research challenges defined in the
CROSSOVER draft Roadmap.

This annex includes a brief description of the 25 practices that have been shortlisted, analysed
according to the template developed in the first phase of Analysis (see Methodological section).

Innovative           policy ALERTS addresses land use challenges facing three types of decision-
elements of the case         makers: government officials who want an ‘instant snapshot’ of land
                             change at different scales; national governments and conservation

                             stakeholders who want to be alerted of recent land changes in their areas
                             of interest; and scientific and policy researchers who want to explore land
                             change dynamics over a long period in greater detail, preferably in a
                             geospatial environment.
Innovative   technological ALERTS has three technical components: a change detection system; a

elements of the case         geospatial analysis environment; and a web 2.0 portal that enables
                             customized alerts of land change.
                             Change detection system: ALERTS is based on geospatial data mining
                             algorithms, developed by the University of Minnesota, that leverage

                             MODIS time series data. These algorithms, which draw on ten years of
                             research in signal processing and data mining technology and have been
                             published in peer-reviewed journals, identify meaningful patterns in
                             vegetation signals. The ALERTS suite of algorithms can identify sudden
                             drops, gradual decreases, or gradual increases in vegetation, and are

                             robust to missing data, poor quality observations, and image registration
                             issues. Moreover, they can provide both a reconstructed historical spatial
                             record of deforestation and near real-time change detection services.
                             Geospatial visualization and analysis environment: ALERTS includes a
                             web-based geospatial environment with a number of important features,

                             including:
                                Selective visualization of disturbances at multiple scales
                                Direct access to vegetation reflectance time series for each
                                 disturbance to better understand the nature of land change

                                Ability to compare these time series to other environmental time
                                 series such as temperature and precipitation
                                Access to selected contextual layers, including protected areas, intact
                                 forests, and terrestrial carbon density, allowing pattern identification

                                 and prioritization
                                Analysis tools, such as polygon aggregation, animation of historical
                                 trends, layer transparency, and carbon calculation

                             Web 2.0 platform: A web-based portal also allows users (i.e.

                             governments, NGOs) to subscribe to alerts that send an automated notice
                             whenever land change events are detected in an area of interest. Areas of
                             interest can be defined based on contextual layers, including political
                             boundaries and protected area status.

                             of complex situations and how they evolve over time. The simulation

                             model is based on the biogeophysical and integrated assessment
                             literature and includes representations of the carbon cycle, other GHGs,
                             radiative forcing, global mean surface temperature, and sea level change.
                             C-ROADS has been calibrated against global climate models used by the

                             Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
                             The model can be readily revised and expanded based on user feedback
                             and new developments in climate science, and as new data become
                             available.
Innovative   technological C-ROADS is designed to capture the key insights from larger integrated

elements of the case         assessment models or detailed General Circulation Models (GCMs) and
                             make them available for rapid policy experimentation. The model has
                             been subjected to a suite of rigorous tests, documented in the C-ROADS
                             reference guide. Model output has been tested against the output of

                             large, disaggregated models such as MAGICC, BERN, ISAM, MiniCAM,
                             AIM, CETA and MERGE and the resulting temperature output of C-ROADS
                             has been found to align very closely under a range of emissions scenarios
                             including those in the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC.

                             C-ROADS emphasizes:
                                    Transparency: equations are available, easily auditable, and
                                     presented graphically.
                                    Understanding: model behavior can be traced through the model

                                     structure to determine the causal factors contributing to results;
                                     we don’t say “because the model says so.”
                                    Flexibility: the model supports a wide variety of user-specified
                                     scenarios at varying levels of complexity.

                                    Consistency: the simulator is consistent with historic data, the
                                     structure and insights from larger models, and the IPCC AR4.
                                    Accessibility: the model runs with a user-friendly graphical
                                     interface on a laptop computer in real time.

                                    Robustness: the model captures uncertainty around the climate
                                     outcomes associated with emissions decisions through Monte-
                                     Carlo simulations.

CASE IMPLEMENTATION
                             C-ROADS has been used in strategic planning sessions for decision-makers
                             from government, business and civil society and in interactive role-
                             playing policy exercises.

                             In 2009, C-ROADS made its debut in the policy world during a global-
                             warming war game in Washington DC, where participants — including
                             President Obama’s climate and energy czar, Carol Browner, and State

                             negotiators in the United States and Europe.
                             C-ROADS was developed by Ventana Systems, Sustainability Institute, and
                             the MIT System Dynamics Group, as part of Climate Interactive, a multi-

                            The City of Hamburg was the first to implement DEMOS-Plan and acted as

                            its pilot user. The Internet-based public participation platform DEMOS-
Description Abstract        Plan was designed to enable the whole formal participatory process to be
                            handled on the Internet and thus can offer optimum solutions, especially
                            for the coordinating body. It is intuitive and simple and can be easily

                            operated even by relatively inexperienced users. The software supports
                            the coordinator throughout, from the setting up of new public

                            consultations to the analysis and evaluation stage. Parallel processes,
                            such as changes to several planning tiers covering an area, can also be
                            handled clearly using one single platform.
                            The aim of DEMOS-Plan is to encourage standardisation of the land use

                            planning process and reduction in the amount of time and effort
                            involved. Documents can be made generally available on a central
                            participation platform. Those involved in the land use planning process
                            can consult the complete documentation online as and when they
                            require, or alternatively “collect it” electronically. In exceptional cases

                            documents can also be ordered in printed form. Any submissions can be
                            made electronically and can thus be further processed without media
                            discontinuity.
                            In addition, a direct link can be established between text-based and
                            geographical   planning  components.    The   combination of    digital

                            submissions and WebGIS functionality aims to go beyond what has
                            hitherto been available to public authorities.
                            For a coordinator like the City of Hamburg, the participation platform
                            facilitates the handling of the whole formal participatory process without

                            any media discontinuity, from the drawing up of plans, through the
                            evaluation stage, to tabling of the project before the decision-making
                            body.

CASE IMPLEMENTATION

                            The goal of the pilot process was to identify the requirements, wishes and
                            expectations which all involved parties have towards an internet based
                            participation process in land use planning. In close cooperation with the
Implementation Approach     city the participation platform was developed and tested using two real
- Deployment                world plans. 60 of 80 involved public agencies decided to use the online

                            process, which lead to a significant reduction in printing and personal
                            costs.

                           discussion. The discussions, suggestions and ideas flow directly into the
                           ongoing work of the Commission.

Implementation Approach    The results of the individual project groups are summarized in an interim
- Deployment               report. This also includes the first recommendations to the German
                           Bundestag. The first previously submitted interim report on media
                           literacy contains many suggestions of citizens that have been introduced

                             The GAINS model explores cost-effective emission control strategies
                             that simultaneously tackle local air quality and greenhouse gases so as
                             to maximize benefits at all scales.

                             The GAINS Model simultaneously addresses health and ecosystem
                             impacts of particulate pollution, acidification, eutrophication and
                             tropospheric ozone. Simultaneously, the model considers greenhouse

                             equivalence. Historic emissions of air pollutants and GHGs are
                             estimated for each country based on information collected by
                             available  international emission inventories and on national

Description Abstract
                             projections are specified in five year intervals through the year 2030.
                             Options and costs for controlling emissions are represented by several
                             emission reduction technologies. Atmospheric dispersion processes
                             are often modeled exogenously and integrated into the GAINS Model
                             framework. Critical load data and critical level data are often compiled

                             exogenously and incorporated into the GAINS modeling framework.
                             The model can be operated in the 'scenario analysis' mode, i.e.,
                             following the pathways of the emissions from their sources to their
                             impacts. In this case the model provides estimates of regional costs

                             and environmental benefits of alternative emission control strategies.
                             The Model can also operate in the 'optimization mode' which identifies
                             cost-optimal allocations of emission reductions in order to achieve
                             specified deposition levels, concentration targets, or GHG emissions
                             ceilings. The current version of the model can be used for viewing

                             activity levels and emission control strategies, as well as calculating
                             emissions and control costs for those strategies.

                                reduced most cost-effectively. The models identifies a balance of

CASE IMPLEMENTATION
                            GAINS estimates historic emissions of 10 air pollutants and 6 GHGs for
                            each country based on data from international energy and industrial
                            statistics, emission inventories and on data supplied by countries

                            themselves. It assesses emissions on a medium-term time horizon,
                            with projections being specified in five-year intervals through the year
                            2050.
                            GAINS estimates for each country/region the potential emission
                            reductions that are offered by about 2000 specific emission control

                            measures and their costs. For user-specified packages of measures,
                            GAINS calculates resulting effects on ambient air quality (fine particles,
                            ground-level ozone, deposition of sulfur and nitrogen), and the
                            subsequent impacts on human health and ecosystems (see figures

CASE IMPLEMENTATION
                            GLEAM is based on a multidisciplinary approach that combines
                            mathematical modeling and computational science with real-world

                            data and sophisticated interface design.

                            range of epidemiological studies are used, covering different types of
                            infections and intervention scenarios.

- Deployment                driven simulations of the worldwide spread of infectious diseases.
                            GLEAM runs on high performance computers to create in-silico
                            experiments that would be hardly feasible in real systems and to guide
                            our understanding of typical non-linear behavior and tipping points of

                            epidemic phenomena.
                            A suite of computational tools is provided to help modeling the spread
                            of a disease, understanding observed epidemic patterns, studying the
                            effectiveness of different intervention strategies. The tools are

                            The Madrid Participa project is a highly efficient instrument used to
                            increase citizen participation in the decision-making process in the city
                            of Madrid, offering a more dynamic and continuous dialogue between

                            political representatives and citizens. When compared to traditional
Description Abstract        citizen consultations, the Madrid Participa approach of using secure
                            eVoting technology in parallel with the paper channel enables Madrid
                            City Council to carry out more convenient and user-friendly
                            consultations while avoiding the costs of a traditional vote. To date,

                            the eConsultations platform implemented has been used regularly in
                            22 citizen consultations involving more than 3.5 million citizens.

                            The aim of the project is to construct a computer-based simulation
                            model as a decision-support tool for policy-making in the early life
                            course. This entails building a model with micro-level data derived
                            from existing longitudinal studies to quantify, for policy purposes, the
                            underlying drivers and determinants of progress in the early life

                            course. The application software will be available to policy makers and
                            researchers via a desktop and/or web-based interface, and will enable
                            end-users to ask “what if” questions across a range of social policy

                            and parameter inputs.
                            The project eveloped a model of early child development in New
                            Zealand. Predictors of important childhood transitions are derived by
                            analysing New Zealand child cohort studies to create a micro-
                            simulation model of the first thirteen years of children’s lives. The

                            MEL-C model involves simulation of various aspects of children’s lives
                            from birth to age 13.

                             To date the project has focussed on simulation of three outcomes:
                             health service use (general practitioner visits, hospital admissions and

                             hospital outpatient attendances from ages 0-10), early literacy
                             (reading ability from ages 8-13), and antisocial behaviour (conduct
                             problems from ages 6-10). Potential predictors of these outcomes that
                             have been modelled include: demographic characteristics (gender,

                             ethnicity), family characteristics (family structure, family size, parental
                             education, parental employment, parental socio-economic status,
                             parental smoking and drinking, home ownership and type, welfare
                             receipt, parental emotional responsiveness, parental punishment),
                             pre- and peri-natal influences (smoking and drinking in pregnancy,

                             birth weight, gestational age, breastfeeding), and early childcare
                             attendance.  To enable policy makers and other interested parties to
                             easily modify and test the impact of influential factors in the life-
                             course model, a software application has been developed that acts as
                             a ‘window’ into the micro-simulation model. This application was

                             programmed in JAVA and R with a graphical user interface called
                             JAMSIM. Using JAMSIM for the MEL-C model, users have the ability to:
                             (i) view parameter descriptives and distributions for ‘base’ scenarios
                             (i.e., where no parameters had been changed); (ii) change parameters
Implementation Approach
- Deployment                 in flexible ways, including: (a) changing the proportion of individuals in
                             categories of a discrete variable; (b) changing the values of a
                             continuous variable for individuals; and (c) changing a parameter at
                             one point in time or at many different points in time; and view the
                             results of scenarios and to compare the results of two or more

                             different scenarios. To ensure the usability of the MEL-C modelling
                             software for policy makers, both the micro-simulation model and the
                             software that supports it have been developed in collaboration with
                             policy makers. To this end four New Zealand government ministries –
                             Health, Education, Justice, and Social Development – have formed an

                             end-users group for the project. This group has four main roles: (i) to
                             provide input into the developmental work of the modelling tool to
                             ensure, once completed, the modelling tool will meet the needs of
                             potential end-users; (ii) to provide advice about social policies of
                             particular interest to the government agencies represented by the

                             policy reference group so that realistic and useful policy scenarios can
                             be modelled; (iii) to facilitate the testing of the modelling tool within
                             respective policy reference group members’ own government
                             agencies, to assist with optimisation and completion of the modelling

                             tool; and (iv) champion the modelling tool’s implementation and use in
                             government agencies.

                            taxes) and expenditure by category. The size of bubbles is proportional

                            to the size of budget items. This simple visual helps to compare the
Implementation Approach sums. One can click on a bubble to see cost articles within each budget

                            manipulating different sums results in the balance of the budget.

                            Ideally, every budget needs to be balanced, so the changes you make
                            on the spending sides should be balanced on the income side!

Description Abstract        UrbanSim is a large scale land use and transportation simulator that
                            models the possible long-term effects of different policies on urban
                            regions. The output is presented using indicators, which are variables
                            that convey information on significant aspects of the simulation

                            results. Currently an upgrade of the exiting UrbanSim model to a zone-
                            level OPUS model is under execution.

Innovative          policy UrbanSim is designed to support metropolitan planning and policy

elements of the case        analysis in a more scientifically rigorous manner than the land-use
                            model previously used by the Wasatch Front Regional Council, with
                            land-use forecasts being influenced by the proposed transportation
                            system. By integrating UrbanSim with the regional travel models, a
                            range of land use and transportation policy interventions can be

                            combined into policy scenarios and the systematic effects of these
                            scenarios can be explored on urban development outcomes and the
                            quality of the transportation system.
Innovative   technological Three software tools (GIS, UrbanSim, and Travel Model) are used

elements of the case        concurrently and pass information back and forth to each other - for
                            example, GIS layers as modified were provided to UrbanSim, which in
                            turn could modify the layer and port it back into the GIS as a new layer
                            depicting a specific urban scenario. This flexible technology package,
                            while not unique to this planning effort – it actually is fairly common –

                            allows planners the ability to model future land use patterns and
                            populations, create a travel model for the future community, and
                            depict the results in tables and maps. Thus, alternative solutions can
                            be created and evaluated during the selection process.

                            In particular, UrbanSim is a software-based demographic and
                            employment modeling tool for integrated planning and analysis of

                            urban development, incorporating the interactions between land use,
                            transportation, environment, economy and public policy with
                            demographic information. It simulates in a 3D environment the
                            choices of individual households, businesses, and parcel landowners

                            and developers, interacting in urban real estate markets and
                            connected by a multi-modal transportation system. This approach
                            works with individual agents as is done in agent-based modeling, and
                            with very small cells as in the cellular automata approach, or even
                            buildings and parcels. But it differs from these approaches by drawing

                            together choice theory, a simulation of real estate markets, and
                            statistical methods to estimate model parameters and to calibrate
                            uncertainty in the model system.

CASE IMPLEMENTATION
                            The Wasatch Front Regional Council has developed and tested the
                            UrbanSim land use modeling system for the Greater Salt Lake Region
                            of Utah. The UrbanSim model is integrated with the regional travel
                            models, and this integrated model system is an advanced analytical

                            framework used to help develop long-range land use forecasts and to
                            evaluate land-use and transportation scenarios in the Regional
                            Transportation Planning process. It was recently applied during the
                            Wasatch Choices 2040 Visioning effort. During the implementation,
                            several challenges were faced: Data needs, Model estimation,

                            Transportation accessibility feedback, and Model validation.
                            UrbanSim has generally become a standard tool for metropolitan land
                            use and transportation planning, and is currently used, or is in the
Implementation Approach     process of implementation, for the simulation of numerous

                            and Zurich.

                             It is intended for use by Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs),
                            cities, counties, non-governmental organizations, researchers and
                            students interested in exploring the effects of infrastructure and policy

Availability of Results / There were several unique innovations used in the process:
Impact Assessment Study            The high amount of public involvement, led to a tremendous
                                    amount of public comments, which were individually
                                    addressed throughout the process.

                                   The utilization of UrbanSim early in the process, was a unique
                                    feature that allowed consideration of land use principles
                                    before determination of transportation needs.
                                   The development and use of a scoring method to prioritize

                                    projects was a unique feature of the solutions screening
                                    process. The WFRC weighted the various metrics according to
                                    regional standards which when applied to the project
                                    solutions, generated the final list of prioritized projects.
                                   Finally, the sheer amount of data considered at this early stage

                                    of a project was a true innovation, compared to traditional
                                    planning studies. As shown in the metrics/measures section of
                                    this document, there were numerous detailed metrics for
                                    which the solutions were evaluated against. This level of detail

                                    in a regional planning effort is something unique to this
                                    process and generated solutions that were well supported
                                    with real data.

Description Abstract
                            the Prime Minister submitted a bill to the Parliament about an

                            without any input from the population, Iceland decided to crowd-
                            source its new constitution to its citizens through social media. In fact,

                            since from the beginning of the process, the Constitutional Council has
                            made possible for the public to send messages which are published on
                            the Council’s website in order to foster a lively discussion. Thereby,
                            every citizen had the opportunity to take part to the drafting of the

                            constitution. The work of the Constitutional Council is also publicly
                            available on social media such as Facebook, YouTube and Flickr.

                            and every Thursday at 13:00 there was live broadcast from the
                            Constitutional Council meetings on the webpage and on Facebook, so
                            that the public could keep track of the discussion and give feedback
                            and contributions. The new constitution has been drafted and awaits
                            ratification by Althingi, which is the supreme legislation body of the

                            nation. After the ratification the constitution is to be proposed to the
                            general population for approval by the mean of a binding referendum.
                            The new constitution will include checks and responsibilities for
                            parliament, strict separation of powers and many other rules intended

Implementation Approach     to prevent a repeat of the financial crisis, alongside changes in the
- Deployment                election and appointment systems of ministers of parliament are
                            elected and judges. The Constitutional Council, comprised of 25
                            delegates, had the task to discuss the Constitutional Committee Report
                            and to prepare a bill for the revised constitution, building on the

                            results of the National Forum 2010 and the former constitution. The
                            National Forum 2010 was an assembly of 950 random participants
                            organized in subcommisions, which presented a 700 page document
                            providing the basis for constitutional changes. The Council, whose
                            members were elected amongst 522 ordinary candidates (including

                            lawyers, political science professors, journalists, and many other
                            professions), had three to four months to decide which parts of the old
                            constitution to amend and which new provisions or chapters to add.

Innovative          policy In the 2050 Calculator, the UK has developed an interactive simple to
elements of the case        communicate tool that allows experts and non-experts alike to
                            develop their own combination of change in different technologies and
                            sectors of the economy to explore different energy and emissions
                            scenarios out to 2050.

                            The distinguishing features of the UK 2050 Calculator are that it is:
                               Simple and user friendly: the tool can be used by a wide range of
                                people, with no modelling expertise necessary. The 2050
                                Calculator is built in Excel, but there is a user friendly “web tool”

                                for pathway design. The web tool includes visualisations of the
                                implications of a pathway for energy supply, demand, landscape, a
                                “sankey” energy flow diagram, costs, and air quality. A “My2050
                                simulation” was also created for use as an educational tool in
                                schools.

                               User driven: the user determines the pathway by specifying how
                                much of each technology is in place by 2050.
                               Comprehensive: there is huge uncertainty about future technology
                                and behaviour. So every option in the Calculator has four effort

                                levels, representing the minimum and maximum that experts
                                believe possible.
                               Open: all assumptions, the Excel spreadsheet and documentation
                                are published.

Innovative   technological The 2050 Calculator has three levels of complexity:
elements of the case           My 2050 simulation – for the public: Visual internet simulation that
                                helps young people to imagine how the energy system will evolve,
                                and the secondary impacts this will have. Users can make decisions
                                about levels of effort in 14 simplified sectors, including both supply

                                and demand, to make decisions about their own version of how
                                their country will meet the energy and emissions challenge by
                                2050.
                               2050 Webtool – for policy makers: Internet based scenarios model.

                                By varying the level of ambition for change in over 44 technologies
                                and behaviours a policy maker is able to get instant results
                                showing information on energy output, demand and emissions out
                                to 2050. It enables a quick comparison of the consequences and
                                trade-offs of different scenarios.

                               Excel spreadsheets - for technicians: Detailed spreadsheets
                                outlining all the underlying data such as emissions baselines,
                                population and expected economic growth as well as the
                                assumptions used to calculate costs. They are freely available to

                            and assesses how they can be effectively combined to achieve these
Description Abstract        levels of emissions reduction. The intention is to assess whether such

                            ambitious target are feasible, identify the main problems (including the
                            transition costs), and the main decision points over the future time
                            horizons.
                            The objectives of this project are to develop the backcasting approach
                            to transport planning in London from now until 2050.

CASE IMPLEMENTATION

                            The VIBAT start with a proposition of policy packages that aim to
Implementation Approach achieve the desired goal. Then the users can use the TC-SIM which is an
- Deployment                interactive simulation tool that allows users to make choices about their
                            future lifestyles in order to reduce transport carbon emissions.

                            In the simulation the stakeholders are able to make decisions about the
                            packaging of low emission vehicles, alternative fuels, pricing regimes,

                            public transport, walking and cycling, urban planning (strategic and local
                            urban design), ICT developments, “smarter choices” (travel planning
                            and car sharing), ecological driving and lower speeds, freight transport
                            logistics use, long distance travel substitution (air to rail) and air

                            demand reduction.
                            The objective in playing the game is to package the options in a manner
                            that is acceptable to the user, yet reduces carbon emissions in the
                            transport sector. TC-SIM is calibrated to the London situation using data
                            from Transport for London (TfL) and the Greater London Authority

                            (GLA).
                            TC-SIM is web-based and offers an innovative, and potentially very
                            flexible, means of decision-making. It is a non-real-time collaborative
                            experience where several individual users can interact within the same
                            model and establish a dialogue about the decisions being made.

                            The simulation tool is easily adapted to different spatial locations by
                            loading different background material and baseline information,
                            without having to make changes to the rules set. It can be tuned or
                            “pitched” at audiences of different ages or make up. One key outcome

                            is an awareness of how, in particular circumstances, individual choice
                            may lead to community negative outcome, an extreme example of
                            which is the “tragedy of the commons”.

                            Your Voice in Europe has been set up in the context of the Interactive
                            Policy Making initiative. As part of the Commission’s Mini­mum
                            Standards on Consultation, it aims at improving Euro­pean gover­nance
                            and intro­ducing Better Regulation.

                            IPM is a multilingual online questionnaire management system that
                            handles all steps involved in a survey life cycle: design, test, translation,
                            launch, collection of replies, and analysis of results. It is available for
                            free as Open Source Software to administrations, businesses and

                            citizens within the European Union.
Description Abstract        The objective of the Interactive Policy Making (IPM) initiative is to use
                            modern technologies, particularly the Internet, to allow both Member
                            State administrations and EU institutions to understand the needs of
                            citizens and enterprises better. It is intended to assist policy

                            development by allowing more rapid and targeted responses to
                            emerging issues and problems, improving the assessment of the impact
                            of policies (or the absence of them) and providing greater accountability
                            to citizens. This system has been put in place to facilitate the
                            stakeholders' consultation process by the use of easy-to-use and

                            straightforward online questionnaires, making it easier both for
                            respondents to participate and for policy makers to analyse the results.

     The first phase of analysis has also revealed some interesting findings.
           It seems that there is a plethora of state-of-the art tools and platforms that might be able to

            support the different stages of the policy making cycle and assist decision makers. However,
            there is very little evidence of practical applications and real use cases which can prove the

            usability, impact and appropriateness of such tools in real-life settings.
           As Policy Making 2.0 is a very young field of research and application, many relevant tools and
            solutions have been developed quite recently, and therefore there is no sufficient evidence of

            their impact and applicability.
           Many cases retrieved in Policy Making 2.0 are based on old-fashioned eParticipation

            approaches (such as eVoting, ePetitions, eConsultations), which take advantage of obsolete
            technologies that have been developed (in the best case) at the beginning of the Web2.0 era.

           There are many research projects funded by the European Commission (under FP7, CIP or other
            regional, national or international instruments) which are focusing on quite specific aspects of
            policy making, yet their existence as “experiments” has excluded them from the analysis as

            their pilot operations do not guarantee sustainability or real use by policy makers.


     The outcome of the first phase of the analysis has resulted in the identification of a shortlist of 25
     cases, based on various criteria as mentioned in the Methodological section of this report. The

     following tables depict the relevance of the cases identified to the policy making cycle steps (Table C1)

     and to the CROSSOVER Research Challenges (Tables C2 and C3).
