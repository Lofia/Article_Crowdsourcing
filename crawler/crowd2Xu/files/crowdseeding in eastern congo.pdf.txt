Abstract
Poor-quality data about conflict events can hinder humanitarian responses and

bias academic research. There is increasing recognition of the role that new infor-
mation technologies can play in producing more reliable data faster. We piloted a
novel data-gathering system in the Democratic Republic of Congo in which villa-

gers in a set of randomly selected communities report on events in real time via
short message service. We first describe the data and assess its reliability. We
then examine the usefulness of such ‘‘cr owdseeded’’ data in two ways. First, we

implement a downstream experiment on aid and conflict and find evidence that
aid can lead to fewer conflict events. Se cond, we examine conflict diffusion in
Eastern Congo and find evidence that key dynamics operate at very micro levels.

Both applications highlight the benefit of c ollecting conflict data via cell phones in
real time.

Information technology is becoming increasingly visible as a means for gathering

data on social trends. Web-based social networks are used to organize, mobilize,
and coordinate activities—from riots in London to regime change in the Middle
East. Satellite imagery is used by the United Nations High Commissioner for

Refugees to track population movements during conflicts or droughts and by the
International Criminal Court to learn abou t the presence of mass graves in Bosnia.

And cell phones, combined with geo-mapping software, are used to create early
warning systems. Information technology is now also employed prominently in
research. Satellite imagery has been used to study economic growth (Henderson,

Storeygard, and Weil 2011, 2012), Twitter to learn about the Gaza Conflict
(Zeitzoff 2011), and geographic informa tionsystemdatatoassessmanyelements
of conflict (Lujala 2010; Raleigh and Heg re 2009; Lujala, Gleditsch, and Gilmore

2005; Weidmann, Rod, and Cederman 2010; Raleigh et al. 2010).
   Despite broad interest in understanding patterns of political violence, the devel-
opment of micro-level measures remains weak. There have been improvements in

data collection on violence, but these data are typically at a high level of aggrega-
tion. As Verwimp, Justino, and Bruck (2009) argue, ‘‘At a fundamental level, con-
flict originates from individuals’ behavio r and their repeated interactions with their

surroundings, in other words, from its micro-foundations’’ (p. 307). Recent work
by Autesserre in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) illustrates the point:
although the war officially came to an end in 2003, thousands of civilians still die

each week. A plausible reason is that international interventions have focused at
the regional and national levels; ignorin g the local level where conflicts over land
and political power became self-sustaining and autonomous from the national and

regional tracks (Autesserre 2009, 2010).
   Micro-level conflict data are normal ly collected by conducting surveys or
interviews. However, obtaining such data in real time using traditional approaches

is difficult because conflict events cluster in areas that have three characteristics.
First, they are insecure, wh ich limits the ability of resear chers to visit them. Sec-
ond, they are often physically hard to acce ss (indeed, difficult terrain is signifi-

cantly related to a higher incidence of c ivil war; Fearon and Laitin 2003). Third,
they may exhibit high levels of societal su spicion and distrust due to, for example,

recent conflict experiences or the influx of new, unknown people due to displacement.
These characteristics can create different types of biases that affect data quality.
   First are selection biases. If areas are off-limits while conflict events take place,

researchers often access an1 enlist the cooperation of only a (nonrandom) fraction of
the research populations. Such selection biases may arise in subtle ways—for
example, even if all areas are covered by a survey, security considerations may result

in scheduling adjustments, so that different regions are only visited when it is safe to
do so. Also, testimonies are only taken from the living.
   Second are risks of recall bias arising wh en data are gathered after the conclu-

sion of conflict. Coughlin (1990) provid es an overview of the literature. While
time cues might lessen this bias in some cases, De Nicola and Gine´ (2014) find

Van der Windt and Humphreys                                                           3



evidence that the use of time cues can so metimes exacerbate the problem. One
example is the problem of ‘‘telescoping,’’ where respondents run together several
events and lose track of when they actually happened. The importance of prompt

data collection then may depend on the dur ation of the conflict and the number of
events taking place.
   Third are risks of reporting bias that may arise when sensitive questions are

asked in settings characterized by distrust and suspicion. Trust has to be created
to obtain high-quality responses. However, this is es pecially difficult in conflict
areas where data collection is often a one-off activity.   2And, of course, reporting
                                                                                    3
mayalsobebiasedbecauseofdeliberate           attempts to manipulate information.
   We seek to investigate how information technology can overcome the problems

associated with the collection of conflict data. To do so, we piloted a ‘‘crowdseed-
ing’’ system that collected information via short message service (SMS) from pre-
identified informants in randomly sampled locations. The project, Voix des Kivus,

was implemented between 2009 and 2011 in the war-torn province of South Kivu
in Eastern DRC. Large parts of the province are hard to access and although there
is reasonable cell phone coverage, access to cell phone technology is limited.

   In using cell phone technology, we build off the ‘‘crowdsourcing’’ approach pio-
neered by groups such as Ushahidi. Under crowdsourcing, anyone can send an SMS
to a central platform in which messages are gathered, stored, and visualized on a

map. Though clearly a compelling system for ‘‘fire alarm’’ monitoring, there are rea-
sons to worry that the data generated through such systems are not representative.     4

Reporters might send incorrect information—for example, they might overreport
hardship hoping for humanitarian intervention. The data may also be unrepresenta-
tive for more innocent reasons: only people with access to a cell phone (and who

have heard about the project) can send messages. Furthermore, the system will only
receive messages from people who are willing to pay the cost of an SMS.       5
   The crowdseeding approach seeks to co mbine the strengths of crowdsourcing

technologies to generate detailed real-tim e data, with the strengths of traditional
approaches that rely on known sources and representative samples. Like crowd-

sourcing, crowdseeding can alleviate some of the concerns regarding selection
biases highlighted previously. Rather tha n relying on discrete retrospective data
gathering, these approaches rely on continuous information flows from individuals

in the conflict region. Indeed, even if an a rea is off-limits to a research team, SMS
can still be sent and received. Moreover, real-time data gathering removes con-
cerns related to recall. Crowdseeding offers additional advantages relative to

crowdsourcing. First, by working with a random set of villages, data from a crowd-
seeding system render data that are representative at the village level. Moreover, if
the reporters are preidentified and given the means to provide information, the risk

that bias will be introduced when reporters self-select into the system is reduced.
Even in the event of forced displacements , the reporter can continue providing

information. Finally, crowdseeding may a lleviate concerns associated with distrust
because, by working with preselected reporters over extended periods, the system

allows both for the generation of trust an d for a greater ability to verify received
information. Repeated interactions can r educe the incentive for reporters to send
incorrect information and allows for rea dy auditing and verification of data.

   In this article, we introduce data from the Voix des Kivus system and explore
its utility in practice. In th e second section, we describe the implementation and
feasibility of the system. We then present t he data in the third section, describing

the distribution of messages and assessin g the overall data quality. Specifically, to
assess data quality, we investigate wheth er time, reporter type, and event type
affect whether an event is reported and compare the coverage to two existing con-

flict data sets collected by traditiona l survey methods and by Armed Conflict
Location and Events Data Set (ACLED’s) primarily media-based system. The

fourth section provides two illustrations of the use of the data. In the ‘‘Application 1:
The Conflict Impact of Development Programs’’ subsection, we assess the effects of

tion by considering ethical and practical implications of scaling up this type of data
system.


The Voix des Kivus System

The Voix des Kivus (literally ‘‘Voice of the Kivu s’’) data collection system was

piloted in the province of South Kivu in the war-torn East of the DRC over an
eighteen-month period starting in Augus t 2009. The pilot ran in eighteen villages
                                                                                     6
spread over four territories: Kalehe (5), Mwenga (4), Uvira (3), and Walungu (6).
Villages 1 through 4 were selected pur posely to ensure some conflict and some
nonconflict areas; villages 5 through 1 8 were selected using stratified random

sampling from these territories. Specifically, villages were randomly selected
stratified by chiefdom and by the village ’s treatment status in a large develop-
ment project (we discuss the project in more detail in the ‘‘Application 1: The

Conflict Impact of Development Program s’’ subsection), taking village popula-
tion sizes into account. Figure 1 shows the approxim ateareaofoperation.        8 The
headquarters of Voix des Kivus was Bukavu—the capital city of South Kivu and

also the city where most of the provinc e’s nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs) are located.

   Within these villages, the Voix des Kivus system worked as follows. In each vil-
lage, we identified three reporters: one rep resenting the traditional leadership (the

   Reporters automatically received week ly phone credit that they could use freely
and were reimbursed for the number of messages sent. Remaining in the system

required sending at least one message a week, but this message could be blank.
Thus, sending messages to the system was free, but it was also voluntary—while

users did not have to pay for each message , they did not get any marginal financial

rewards for sending content either. On the receiving side was a standard cell phone
linked to a laptop computer. With freely a vailable software (FrontlineSMS and R),
messages received were automatically filtered, coded for content, cleaned to

remove duplicates, and merged into a database. Graphs and tables were generated
automatically and then mounted into bullet ins with different levels of source iden-

tifiability. Noncoded text messages (of ten from Swahili or one 11 the local lan-
guages into French and English ) were translated manually.
   Our first goal in implementing the pilot was to assess the feasibility of data

collection of this form. Establishing feasibility was important in light of a number
of obvious challenges.
   A first concern was that human capacity would be too weak for users to imple-

ment the project. Indeed, nineteen of our fifty-four reporters had only primary-
level education, and only two had receive d education beyond secondary school.
This concern is likely to be present in many hard-to-access areas where conflict

takes place. We mitigated this concern t hrough a (minimum) two-day training
by the field coordinator and the use of relatively simple codebooks with precoded
events. In fact, over the eighteen months of operation, Voix des Kivus received—in

addition to SMS with codes—1,144 text messages in Swahili or one of the local
languages; this suggests that the codebook , while useful, was not necessary for
many reporters.

   A second concern was technical capacity . On the receiving side, a cheap net-
book, a phone, and free software were sufficient. However, things were different
on the sending side. Phone coverage was n ot a problem—of the eighteen villages,

no village had to be replaced after selecti on due to lack of coverage. Electricity,
however, was a problem, with reporters sometimes walking up to three hours to
charge their phone. The problem was solved by purchasing US$25 solar chargers

and donating one to each Voix des Kivus village. Providing consistent access to
electricity through these low-cost solar ch argers was important in ensuring regular
information from the villages in our sample.

   A third concern, however, is specific to crowdseeding systems: Would parti-
cipation in the system produce security risks for reporters? Over the course of

eighteen months, Voix des Kivus received thousands of messages, many of which
were sensitive, including i nformation on various types of abuses perpetrated by
different actors. Because of the close conn ection between individual reporters and

theproject,wewereconcernedthattherec           ould be reprisals against reporters for
sharing information. Beyond regular monitoring, we used three strategies to
address this concern. First, we operated i n just four villages at first, and subsequent

villages were added only after one year of careful monitoring. Second, the weekly
bulletins were generated in two versions. On e version contained sensitive informa-
tion (with village identifiers); the other did not. The sensitive bulletins were only

disseminated to a very restricted set of orga nizations. Public versions contained no
village identifiers. Third, the system allo wed reporters to include a code (1–4) to a

[MONUSCO], and ‘‘1’’ everybody).         We found that at no point did any user indi-
cate any security concern of any form arisi ng from their participation in the proj-

ect. However, although no concerns arose in our case, there are still general
grounds for concerns for the security of the reporters in a crowdseeding system
because of the direct link between reporters and the project. We return to this

concern in the concluding section.


The Data

In this section, we describe the data and assess data quality.    13 Specifically, we

explore reporting over time (is there evidence of fatigue?), reporting across moni-
tors (do different reporters report differently? Are results robust to weights based
on the number of reporters reporting the event?), and reporting by type of event

(are conflict events more likely to be unde rreported when the potential for sanc-
tioning is higher?). Moreover, we compare the Voix des Kivus data to two existing

conflict data sets collected by traditiona l survey methods and by ACLED’s primar-
ily media-based system.
   Voix des Kivus was launched in August 2009 and operated during the first twelve

months in only four villages. Then from August 2010 onward, the pilot project was
expanded to eighteen villages. The expansion over time is illustrated in the top left
                  14
panel of Figure 2.   The regular system continued through to January 2011 (the ver-
tical line in Figure 2) but remained open for users to send messages—though without
incentives for reporters—through to July 2011.   15

   The top right panel of Figure 2 shows the distribution of total event reports
(dashed line) and conflict event reports (s olid line) over time, per village. Overall,
the system generated a relatively constant stream of messages over this period.

As shown in the lower left panel of Figure 2, reporters exhibited relatively little
fatigue—while different reporters reporte d at different rates, they nevertheless
                                                 16
reported at relatively constant rates over time.
   In this short period, the project received a total of 4,783 non-empty SMS mes-
sages. The reporters sent messages abou t a total of 5,081 events of which 4,623

were unique—many village events were th us reported by more than one reporter.
Of these non-empty SMS messages, 1,144 were text messages.        17 Table 1 provides

summary information per event (where the unit of analysis is the village-month).
Identical messages received from the sam e reporter within thirty minutes of each
other, and identical messages received from different representatives in the same

village within twenty-four hours of each o ther, are treated as single events. The
table also reports the total number of messages sent per event. We find a large
number of messages reporting the presence of troops (685). The most common

conflict events include looting (233), violence between villagers (167), and

Figure 2. Top left panel shows the number of villages enrolled in the system over time; top

right panel shows the average number of events per month by event type. Lower left panel
shows reporter stamina—the cumulative number of events sent per reporter; this panel also

indicates when reporters started and stopped sending messages. The lower right panel shows

that were also reported by other reporters.



kidnappings (135)—which in many cases i nvolved forcing villagers to transport

loads. We also find frequent reports of co nflict-related deaths (292). Reports of
sexual violence (99) indicate approximately equal numbers of men and women

victims. Other major categories include outbreaks of diseases (277) and deaths due

to disease (470), and crop failures (376).

    Tables 2 and 3 show conditional correlations between these reported events.
Specifically, each table shows the bivariate relationships between the column

event and the row event as estimated by or dinary least squares. We control for

village fixed effects to capture the corre lation of different types of events within

a village. Though we provide no causal inte rpretations, a number of patterns seen
in Table 2 are worth highlighting. First, we see the presence of troops is not itself a

good predictor of conflict-related deaths, th ough it is strongly related to other types

of violence (a category that includes lootin g and forced labor). Reports of attacks
are associated with all other conflict and violent events, especially conflict deaths

and displacement but are only weakly ass ociated with health events and social

events. Adverse health events are not directly associated with attacks, but they are

associated with displacement, disasters, and local violence. General development
actions are associated with al most all events; and social activities (such as visits
and meetings) are associated with all eve nts except attacks and conflict deaths.

Overall, there is a clear clustering of bad things going together over time.
   Table 3 focuses on the more disaggregated measures and reveals a number of
striking correlations. First, the presence of UN peacekeepers (MONUSCO) and gov-

ernment soldiers (Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo [FARDC])
tends to be highly correlated. Second, we see that rebel group presence is associated
with actions by MONUSCO and FARDC. Third, we see that presence in itself is

generally not strongly associated with civilian deaths—the exception being the cor-
relation between rebel presence and female deaths. Actions by FARDC are very

strongly associated with deaths, particularly women’s deaths. Actions by MON-
USCO are not associated with deaths and actions by rebels or unidentified groups
are strongly associated with women’s deaths only.



Data Quality

Voix des Kivus was implemented to assess the feasi bility of using crowdseeding to
gather high-quality data. In the absence of a gold standard for conflict event data, it
is difficult to formally validate the approach employed here. Nevertheless, five

considerations on data qua lity are worth emphasizing.
   First, in its first year, Voix des Kivus employed a field coordinator to visit each

of th18reporters at least once every two w eeks to assess the quality of the messages
sent.   The coordinator would assess whether r eporters interpreted codes in the
same way as the researchers, whether respondents employed the correct codes,

given the events they wished to report, and so on. Moreover, the field coordinator
would verify whether events had actually taken place and whether there were other
events that took place that were not reported. Throughout the pilot, the coordinator

found no instances of erroneous reports of major conflict events (incursions,
assaults, or killings) but did find numerous instances where events were not com-

municated by one or all reporters, sugges ting a vulnerability to type II errors.
   Second, because Voix des Kivus distributed phones to three people per village,
we have a measure of internal validation. The bottom right panel of Figure 2 shows

the share of events that were reported by at least two reporters out of all events
reported. We find that internal validation was around 30 percent at the outset
but increased after the project start until August 2010—the moment the project
                             19
expanded to more villages.
   Third, we have a limited ability to compare event information received from the
Voix des Kivus system with data received from a survey we conducted in the same

region in a similar period. In the latter, we asked each village chief, how many events
from a list of potential events had taken place in the village in the preceding month.

Our survey villages o20rlapped with just three  Voix des Kivus villages during the life
span of the project.    We consider three ways of assessing the congruence of the

surveyand the Voix des Kivusdata. First, we compare the average number ofeach type
of event across villages under each approach. On average, we find nearly twice as
many reported events according tothe survey. In particular, there were higher numbers

of children’s deaths due to conflict and citizen deaths due to natural causes, disease
outbreaks, and funerals reported in the survey. Second, despite the difference in
means, the correlation between these two measures of average incidence is 46 per-

cent which is substantively large and statis tically significant. This suggests that
similar types of events get reported to the same relative extent under the two sys-
tems. Third, we generate measures of the average incidence of conflict and non-

conflict events for each of the three villages using e ach of the two data sources,
yielding twelve data points. 21 The correlation between the Voix des Kivus and sur-

vey estimates is low largely because of one outlying observation in which a village
reported a much higher incidence of army visits under the Voix des Kivus system. If
this outlier is dropped, the correlation between the Voix des Kivus and the survey-

based measure is 95 percent. These corre lations are encouraging, although we note
that survey measures are also subject to measurement error and bias, and so on
their own, the correlations do not e stablish the reliability of the data. 22

   Fourth, a problem for any data collection method in conflict areas, including
surveys, is censorship. For example, informants might report fewer conflict events
precisely because of the presence of armed groups and high levels of conflict.

In practice, our reporters provided det aileddataoneventsevenwhentroopswere
present or in the vicinity. Messa ges such as ‘‘FARDC passed by [ Village Omitted]

and shot with guns at 5:30 am’’ and ‘‘A FARDC soldier shot a woman’’ are not
uncommon. And messages such as ‘‘FARDC kidnapped people who were then
forced to transport things’’ and ‘‘FARDC kidnapped people to build a shelter for

the soldiers’’ were received almost weekly by Voix des Kivus. In addition, we
observe many instances in which there is simultaneous reporting of the presence
of armed actors and adverse events of v arious kinds. Moreover, at no point did

reporters indicate to us that they felt a need to censor reports.
   Finally, we note a concern of uneven repor ter participation. The total quantity

of messages sent varies substantially across villages; from month 16 onward, total
reporting varies from a low of 14 from o ne village to a high of 522 for another.
Alongside this broad variation is a positive correlation between reports of events

of many types (as seen in Tables 2 and 3). T hese patterns may reflect true variation,23
but they are also consistent with variation in the overall activity of reporters.
As we demonstrate in the next section, we find mixed evidence on differential

behavior by reporter type. Nevertheless, we believe that heterogeneity in propen-
sities to report could be a fruitful focu s of scrutiny in future applications.



Source Dependence

A crowdsourcing system receives inform ation from an unidentified, anonymous
public. A crowdseeding system, in contr ast, makes use of identifiable users.

Although the system did not gather informa tion about the reporters themselves, the

ability to analyze the ‘‘crowd’’ in more detail and learn whether particular types of
reporters provide different information is a significant benefit.
   InthecaseofVoix des Kivus      , a reporter’s position (chief, women’s representa-

tive, or elected individual) is a natural star ting point to differentiate the crowd. We
find that village chiefs sent substant ially more messages than the women’s

representative or the elected reporte24 respectively, 11.62, 8.30, and 8.90 messages
perpersonpermonthonaverage.
   Subdividing the data by conflict and nonconflict events, we find that around

30 percent of the messages sen25concern conflict events—with elected reporters
sending relatively the most.     Regressing the number of conflict events reported
per month on the type of reporter and the number of nonconflict events reported

in that month—with the chief as baseline and standard errors clustered at the vil-
lage level—partially confirms this. We obtain estimates equal to 0.23 (0.63) and
1.49 (1.33) for the women’s representative and the elected reporter, respectively

(standard errors in parentheses). These di fferences in messaging by reporter posi-
tion are not statistically significant however.
   Reporters may nevertheless differ in the types of events they report. A major task

of the chief is to settle disputes among villagers, particularly those over land.
Another is to be the village’s first point of contact for visitors such as migrants, gov-
ernment officials, and so on. In contrast, the head of the women’s association may be

the go-to person for women who experience sexual violence or domestic violence.
On the other hand, our three reporters are likely to be similarly aware of events such
as funerals and weddings, and activities such as road repairs and construction of the

school, because Congolese villages are small. The table in the Online Appendix pre-
sents the average number of messages sent per village-month by reporter type, where
we also test the difference between them. On average, chiefs send more messages

regarding land conflict (code 44) than do women representatives, but fewer than
elected reporters do—only the first difference is slightly significant. Chiefs—com-
pared to elected reporters—are statistically more likely to report the arrival of refu-

gees and internally displaced persons (code 53) and visits or meetings organized by
the chiefdom or locality authorities (code 95) and by representative of a political

party (code 96). We do not find that the women representatives report more domestic
violence (code 45) or more sexual violence against women (code 64).
   The crowd is not a random subset of the total population and in general what one

learns likely depends on whom one asks. Overall, however, our analysis suggests
that in these data at least, differences in reporting across the three categories of
reporters in the Voix des Kivus villages are relatively muted.



Relation with ACLED Data

We close our discussion of data quality with a comparison of data from the system
and data from what we believe is the best available alternative: the Armed Conflict

Location and Events data set (ACLED), which gathers together data on the specific
dates and locations of conflict events, as well as ancillary information such as
the types of event and the groups involved (Raleigh et al. 2010).      26 The data set

is global in reach, and for the DRC, the data set contains 6,926 conflict events since
January 1, 1997.

   Because conflict clusters in isolated are as, one possible benefit of a crowdseed-
ing system is that it records conflict events that otherwise would have gone unno-
ticed. To test this idea, we compare the number of conflict events reported to Voix

des Kivus with the number of conflict events reported by ACLED for the same
region and time period.   27  The ACLED database reports twenty-seven conflict

events divided over the following event types: battle with no change of territory
control, battle with rebel con trol location, battle with government regaining terri-
tory, headquarters or base establishment, nonviolent activity by a conflict actor,

rioting/protesting, violence against civilians, and nonviolent transfer of location
control. During this same period, Voix des Kivus, on the other hand, received a
total of 1,439 conflict event messages, and this increases to 2,118 messages if
                                                                    28
events related to the presence of conflict actors are included.        This difference
in number of conflict events reported is particularly large considering that Voix des

Kivus reports events for only eighteen vi llages, while ACLED reports conflict
events for the whole area.
   Alongside these quantitativ e differences, there may b e qualitative differences

reflecting, for example, the differences in the sources upon which these data are
based. The ACLED data set derives info rmation from a variety of sources that
                                                                            29
include news reports, humanitarian agencies, and research publications.        Voix des
Kivus, on the other hand, relies on reporting by community-based reporters. To
examine differences, we focus on measures of who perpetrates violence against
          30
civilians.   This is a sensitive topic and different reports might under- or over-
report the importance of one ac tororanother.BothACLEDand              Voix des Kivus
separate out violence against civilians by perpetrator. The Voix des Kivus data

indicate that FARDC is an important perp etrator of violence against civilians,
being responsible for almost 50 percent of the attacks against civilians. ACLED, on

the other hand, indicates that most violence against civilians is perpetrated by rebel31
groups, and less than 20 percent of the violence is initiated by government soldiers.
This number drops to 10 percent when analyzing the ACLED data for the whole
                                                32
period (totaling 239 attacks against civilians).   The two data sets thus paint a very
different picture when it comes to who perpetrates conflict against civilians.



Research Applications

A system like Voix des Kivus provides rich data to learn about conflict areas.
Relationships between diffe rent event types can be analyzed as we did above. Par-
ticular use can be made of the data’s panel component to learn about the dynamics
                                33
of different events over time.     Another interesting application of a phone-based

system is to combine it with external da ta sources and use the data collected by
phone as an outcome measure. The local UN offices could provide historic infor-
mation about patrol routes which can then be used to learn whether these patrols

pacify a region or simply move violence by a rebel group from one area to
another. 34 The data could be combined with sa tellite information about weather
patterns to learn about the impact of, for example, rainfall on different types and

levels of conflict. To learn about electio n violence, data could be collected from
Congo’s National Election Committee on t he location of voting booths (in Novem-
ber 2011, the presidential elections took place in Congo and was in some areas

characterized by high levels of vio lence). Another possibility is to use a Voix des
Kivus-style system as a treatment in order t o examine the effects of transparency

on conflict outcomes of interest.
   In this section, we provide two applications, where Voix des Kivus data provide
outcome data, to illustrate the utility of this kind of data for research. First, we try

to assess the conflict impact of developm entaid.Second,weusethedatatolearn
about the temporal–spatial nature of con flict. In both cases, we highlight ways in
which the conclusions we draw might diffe r from conclusions that we might draw

using more traditional approaches.


Application 1: The Conflict Impact of Development Programs

There is broad recognition tha t development and conflict a re closely related. Major

development interventions focus on countries emerging from war and include
reintegration, reconstruction, capacity building, and o ther initiatives. It remains
unclear, however, if and how these investments are effective. It is expected that

by improving the level of development, t hese projects could reduce risks of vio-
lence. Miguel, Satyanath, a nd Sergenti (2004), for example, find that economic
growth is strongly negatively related to civil conflict. And De Ree and Nillesen

(2009) argue that foreign aid has a dire ct negative impact on the probability of
an ongoing civil conflict to continue.  35 On the other hand, the very introduction

of development actors, financing, and projects could also increase violence. Nunn
and Qian (2014), for example, suggest th at US food aid increases the incidence,
onset, and duration of civil conflicts in re cipient countries and related arguments

have been made by Anderson (1999), De Wa al (2009), and Polman (2011). There
are multiple reasons why th ese relations—or opposite relations—may obtain.
These include changing the resources avai lable for looting, changing the capacity

of local communities to respond, changi ng the incentives of local communities to
participate in violence, and increasing the extent to which communities are—or are
believed to be—monitored by external actors.

   Much of this development conflict literature is at the macro, often the national,
level. Conflict research at the micro-level, and in particular, the impact of develop-

ment aid on local levels of violence,36s sparse and what does exist has up to recently
been largely of a descriptive nature.  This is not surprising because attempts to find

out whether these aid programs actually have an impact on the level of violence face

major identification and measurement challenges (for recent studies that seek to
address the identification challenge at the micro level, see Berman, Shapiro, and
Felter 2011; Crost, Felter, and Johnston 2012; Beath, Christia, and Enikolopov 2011).

   This section shows how crowdseeded data can be coupled with a downstream
experiment to address these problems at the micro level. Between 2007 and 2011, a

randomized development intervention funded by the UK’s Department for Interna-
tional Development (DfID) was implemented by the International Rescue Committee
and CARE International throughout Eastern Congo—including the province of South

Kivu. The villages were selected into the development program by a public lottery—
thus inexpectation treatmentand control villages are alike in all respects except for the
intervention itself. The development project provided communities with financing of

up to US$70,000 to construct local projects such as schoolrooms or clinics—part of
this money was received and managed by the communities directly. The intervention
followed a ‘‘do no harm’’ approach—that is, the projects were implemented in a way

that sought to ensure that they did not spark local conflicts. During the selection of the
Voix des Kivus villages, we took account of the random assignment of this develop-
ment intervention, stratifying our sample upon the villages’ treatment status in order

to obtain balance between the number of Voix des Kivus villages that had the devel-
opment program and those that did not.
   Even with a small sample such as we have, random assignment ensures that

simple difference in means provides an unbiased estimate of the treatment effect.
Of course, with a small sample, our power is weak and we can expect our estimates
to be noisy, though this does not threaten unbiasedness (e.g., Mutz and Pemantle

2011; Imai, King, and Stuart 2008).
   The top line in top left panel of Figure 3 shows the estimated impact of devel-
opment aid on the incidence of conflict u sing simple differences in means. The

points are estimates calculated for eac h month based upon village-month data for
that month and the preceding two months. The gray area indicates the 95 percent
confidence interval, where the standard errors are clustered at the village level. The
                                                  37
bottom line shows the corresponding p values.        Conflict events are measured as
the message codes: 21 through 56, 64 through 65, and 99. Note that this construc-

tion separates the troop presence measures from the violent event measures. Two
results stand out. First, we see that the magnitudes vary over time, with strong esti-
mates of effects in early periods which t hen decline and reemerge, though never to

initial levels. Second, the data provide e vidence of a positive impact of develop-
ment aid: that is, villages with the deve lopment program have a lower level of con-
flict incidence. Not only are the point estimates of the development impact

consistently below the zero line, so are most of the 95 percent confidence intervals,
which is reflected in the fact that the majority of estimated p values (thirteen of the
twenty-two) are at or below .1.

   A set of robustness checks, presented in the other three panels in Figure 3, give
further confidence in these results. First, we provide results using a randomization

Figure 3. Conflict impact of development aid.

Note: The top left panel shows estimated effects (top black line) based on data for that month and the
preceding two months, including 95 percent confidence intervals (gray area) and the corresponding p

values (line in lower subpanel). The top right panel presents results of the randomization inference for the
full sample and the restricted sample (short, thin lines). The restricted sample drops the initial four vil-

lages. The bottom left panel presents results where conflict events reported by one or two individuals are
weighted one-third, or one half as much, respectively, as those reports reported by three individuals.

Based on accumulated data over time, the bottom right panel shows results of randomization inference
for the full sample and the restricted sample.

inference procedure (Fisher 1935).            We repeatedly randomly reassigned our eigh-
teen villages to the treatment and for each of these new reassignments to treatment,

we calculated the distribution of possible estimated effect under the null of no effect.

We then estimated how likely we would have obtained results as strong or stronger

than we did under this null. These results are presented in the top right panel of

Figure 3. Using this approach, we find seven of the twenty-two of the estimated

p values at or below .1, and five of the twenty-two below .05. Note that in the early
periods in which there are only four villages, the p values from randomization infer-
ence can never drop below .25, correctly reflecting the severely restricted set of per-

mutations that are possible with this small set of cases. In later periods, where it is
technically possible to have lower p values, these values drop to below standard
thresholds.

   In this figure, we also include shorter, thin lines that are estimated when we
restrict our analysis to exclude the first four purposefully selected villages that
entered the system.  39 We find that excluding the first four Voix des Kivus villages

makes little difference to our estimates. The estimates, confidence intervals, and
p values are almost identical.

   In a second robustness check, we leverage the possibility for internal validation
of crowdseeded data. Recall that each event can be reported by one, two, or all
three of our reporters. Because we are more confident that events reported by three

individuals have taken place (or have be en substantially important), we regard
those conflict events reported by one or tw o individuals one-third (one-half) as
much as those events reported by three in dividuals. Results are presented in the

bottom left panel in Figure 3. The overall results are very similar to those from the
main analysis although the magnitudes ( p values) are generally somewhat lower
(higher). Finally, the lower right panel o f the figure shows comparable results for

the cumulative effects; here again p values fall as the sample expands; using the
full sample, the effects are strongest though this in part reflects the effects induced

by the first set of villages. As shown by th e thinner lines on the graph, however, the
results are not very sensitive to dropping these units.
   Figure 3 reports results for each month. Given this collection of findings, can we

conclude that the project led to less conflict overall? That is, while in most periods
the estimates are negative and statistically significant, there are periods in which the
estimate is not significantly different from zero. This gives rise to a multiple com-
                                                                                       40
parisons problem. We again use randomization inference to address this problem.
Specifically, we repeatedly randomly reassigned our eighteen villages to the treat-

ment to generate a distribution of est41ated effects for the entire period under the
sharp null of no effect for any unit.    We then assess the likelihood that we would
have obtained results as strong or stronger than we did. We calculate a p value of

.02 for the full period and .04 for the restricted period. This cumulative evidence sug-
gests that the positive effect we estimate for the development project is unlikely due
to chance even for this small sample.   42

   This analysis has been implemented using a very small number of cases from a
relatively small part of Congo, and we therefore do not pretend to make a general
claim here for the relation between development aid and conflict. Our goal here is

to illustrate the promise of a real-time system such as Voix des Kivus. Our analysis
points, we think, to an important advantage of real-time data for the assessment of

causal effects. Existing studies of the effects of development interventions often pro-
duce contradictory results. Yet, these studies differ on many dimensions of design,

including the temporal lag between intervention and measurement. An analysis using
real-time data allows one to measure the extent to which the variance in estimated
effects depends on the timing of measurement. For example, measures of conflict

events that took place in the month prior to data collection might yield an estimated
effect with low variance. However, while this within-period variance is low, the
across-period variance might be high: very different estimates might have been pro-

duced if data were gathered a month earlier or a month later. The top left panel in Fig-
ure 3 suggests the timing of measurement contributes a large share of the true variance
in estimates of treatment effects.3 For example, a researcher collecting data in Octo-

ber 2010 (for that month and the preceding two months) would conclude that there is
no impact of development aid (b ¼▯ .9 and p ¼ .74). On the other hand, if that same

researcher had conducted her study three months earlier or three months later, she
would have concluded that there is strong evidence for a positive effect of develop-
ment aid (b ¼▯ 8.7, p ¼ .02, and b ¼▯ 8.8, p ¼ .07, respectively).



Application 2: Spatial Clustering and Diffusion of Conflict

Conflict is often geographically cluste red. One reason might be that geographi-
cally proximate units are similar to each oth er; another is that conflict might ‘‘spill
over’’ from one location to the next. Population flows may be one driver for diffu-

sion by facilitating the spread of arms, com batants, and ideologies conducive to
conflict (Kuran 1998), altering an area’s ethnic composition (Buhaug 2008) or

exacerbating economic competition (Salehyan and Gleditsch 2006; Van Acker
2005; Claessens, Mudinga, and Ansoms 2013; Vlassenroot and Huggins 2005;
Autesserre 2009, 2010).   44

   While initially limited to rese arch on international c onflict (Starr and Most
1983; O’Loughlin 1986), diffusion-based explanations have since permeated
cross-national studies of civil war (B raithwaite 2010; Buhaug 2008). Disaggre-

gated research on the local dynamics of conflict, however, is more sparse. One rea-
son for this is the difficulty of obtaining h igh-quality, dynamic data on conflict at

the micro level. This is unfortunate becau se there is reason to believe that conflict
diffusion can operate at a very micro level. For example, in Eastern Congo, most
population movements take place withi n chiefdoms, with migrants moving to

nearby villages often only several kilometers away. I n this second application,
we illustrate the usefulness of crowdseed ing data to learn about conflict diffusion
at this level. Moreover, we will also illust rate the usefulness of temporal fine grain

by showing how data collected following a survey-based approach can bias con-
clusions about conflict diffusion.
   Diffusion has been an important force in the spread and duration of conflict in

Congo’s South Kivu province. The First Congo War (1996–1997) and the Second
Congo War (1998–2003) were plausibly a direct result of the 1994 Rwandan geno-
                                                                 45
cide, with an estimated influx of nearly 1.5 million Rwandans.      Internal migration
rates are also high in the region. A survey conducted in 2007 in over 600 randomly

selected villages throughout Eastern Congo finds that a full 71 percent of individuals
in South Kivu had fled at least once at some point during the 1996–2007 period due
                                                          46
to armed activities by organized armed groups or militias.  Table 1 corroborates the
presence of forced movements also for our Voix des Kivus villages (codes 53, 54, and

56).
   Does conflict diffuse in the South Kivu province? We investigate the question
by analyzing whether conflict in a village in a given period is more likely if con-

flict was higher in the previous period i n neighboring villages. To estimate the
magnitude and scope of such spillover eff ects, we pool our village-period data and

model the diffusion process with a simple spatial autoregressive model:
                                    X

                       y ita þ r         yj;t▯1 by i;t▯1þ eit                    ð1Þ
                                   j2NðiÞ

where  P       y    is the spatial lag, which can be interpreted as a sum of the num-
         j2NðiÞ j;t▯1
ber of conflict events in villages in i’s neighborhood, N(i), in the preceding
period.47 The term y      is the lagged dependent variable for village i,and    e is
                      i,t▯1                                             48       it
an error term—assumed to be independent and identically distributed.       Note that
this equation does not include village f ixed effects, though these are examined
              49
subsequently.
   Equation (1) requires a choice about how a neighbor is defined. Are only villages

less than ten kilometers away neighbors or are villages forty kilometers away also
neighbors? This decision can exert a significant influence on the magnitude and
scope of estimated diffusion effects (Anselin 2002; Zhukov and Stewart 2012).

   In South Kivu, those individuals who m igrate due to conflict often only move a
few kilometers from their village of origin—moving to the nearest safe village or

to those villages with family. In 2012, one of the authors collected information
about the migration histories of 8,199 adults in the Buhavu chiefdom—one of
                                                          50
the two chiefdoms in South Ki vu’s territory of Kalehe.      The data show that 92
percent of all movements that originate d in the Buhavu chiefdom and were caused
by conflict—which totaled 4,431 movements—ended in a different village, but in

the same chiefdom. Conflict-induced migration is thus very local in South Kivu,
and we might expect that conflict diffusion is as well. As a result, to test whether

conflict diffusion operates at such a fine-grained level, we estimate the spatial
autoregressive model multiple times, each time with a different definition of
neighbor. Specifically, equation (1) is estimated with a neighbor consecutively

defined as those villages inside the intervals 0 to f6–50g kilometers.
   We also test directly the benefit of a cro wdseeding system to collect very pre-

cise data on the timing of conflict events. To do so, we estimate equation (1) twice:
once where we do not leverage the temporal variation of the data and once where

we do. Specifically, to learn about conflict diffusion, a researcher might conduct a
survey twice in our Voix des Kivus villages, collecting in each survey the number
of conflict events that took place in the p revious period. With both surveys taking

place at different points of time, the conf lict events recorded in the first survey
would constitute the baseline levels on the outcome variable for the subsequent
                                 51
period (y  i,t–1in equation 1).     In contrast to such survey-style data, which collect
data for two periods only, a crowdseeded d ata set is more fine-grained with infor-

mation about the exact timing of events. To leverage this information, we under-
                                                                                     52
take the same analysis but using the village-week as the unit of analysis.              We now
compare the results based upon these different data sets.

   The first two panels in Figure 4 present t he results for each type of analysis. The
black, solid line indicates the estimated impact of conflict in neighboring villages

in the previous period on a village’s incid ence of conflict in this period, for a given
definition of neighbor; the gray areas indicate the 90 percent confidence interval.

   The left panel presents results from estimating equation (1) based on the ‘‘sur-
vey-style’’ data—that is, data without the temporal fine grain, clustering the error

at the village level. Two results stand out. F irst, conflict in neighboring villages in
the previous period is associated with fewer conflict events in this period. Second,

conflict diffusion appears to operate at the micro level. An additional conflict

event in a village less than twenty-five k ilometers away decreases the number of
conflict events by 0.2; a result that is not only statistically but also substantially

significant. As we broaden t he definition of neighbor, and thus include more vil-
lages, the estimated magnitu des decrease. Given these results, a researcher might

conclude that migrant spillovers have a p ositive impact on neighboring villages.
Perhaps in anticipation of responses by peacekeepers or other armed groups, rebel

groups shun an area after attacking a village during the previous period.

   Results are very different, however, when the temporal variation provided by

crowdseeded data is taken into account. The center panel presents results from esti-
mating exactly the same model but on the more fine-grained data. We now find evi-
dence for conflict diffusion: that is, the point estimates are consistently above the

zero line. We again find that previous conflict in villages nearby have a larger impact
than those villages further away. An additional conflict event in a village less than

ten kilometers away increases the number of conflict events by 0.05. The figure
illustrates clearly how this impact decreases as we broaden the definition of neigh-
bor. The point estimate for villages within fifty kilometers is zero.

   A weakness of both of these analyses is that they fail to distinguish between true
diffusion and common causes of conflict among neighbors. While we assumed e           it
to be independent and identically distri buted, variables such as the presence of a

rebel group or a bad harvest might cluster and this might drive our results. Hegre
et al. (2001), for example, find that the apparent clustering of civil war is fully
explained by the clustering of domestic factors (mainly gross domestic product per

capita and regime type). We do not have in formation about such factors for our
Voix des Kivus villages. However, a major benefit of data that has variation over
time is that it allows the researcher to estim ate equation (1) controlling for village-
                     53
level fixed effects.    Results from doing so are re ported in the right panel of
Figure 4. We find that our point estimates almost double and that the confidence
interval hits the zero bound only at 25 kilometers.

   This application illustrates two points. First, it highlights the importance of get-
ting the geographic level right. Conflict dynamics might operate at the very micro
level geographically (see also Schutte and Weidmann 2011). Diffusion that can be

observed at a very fine resolution may be invisible at a lower resolution. For this,
crowdseeding data share strengths with data sets such as ACLED that provide fine
geographic detail (a.o. Raleigh et al. 2010; Hegre, Ostby, and Raleigh 2009; Buhaug

et al. 2011; Weidmann and Ward 2010), though it benefits from a greater density of
reported events. Second, the analysis illustrates the importance of temporal fine
grain. It illustrated how conclusions based on temporally coarse data can produce

conclusions diametrically opposed to what is found with more fine-grained data.
It is possible that effects work at different registers—a more sophisticated model

than that provided in equation (1) might find, for example, that in the short run, there
is local diffusion, but in the longer run, conflict moves farther afield. Assessing such
dynamics, however, requires exactly the fine grain illustrated previously.



Conclusion

The past decade has seen much effort to better understand the causes and conse-
quences of violent conflict. Much of the empirical analysis, however, makes use
of data at high levels of aggregation (of ten the country and year level). It is

therefore not surprising that in their survey of the civil war literature, Blattman and
Miguel (2010, 46) argue that ‘‘a major goa l of civil war researchers within both

economics and political science in the co ming years should be the collection

of new data, especially extended panel micro -data sets.’’ Original micro-level data
are normally collected by conducting sur veys or interviews. The collection of
conflict data in particular faces a set of challenges because of the nature of the

areas in which conflict events take place. These events take place in insecure areas
and are therefore often off-limits to researchers, and if data are gathered long after

the fact, it may suffer from various forms of recall and selection bias.
   In this article, we investigated whether an SMS-based ‘‘crowdseeding’’ system can
be used to obtain high-quality, micro-level panel data on conflict. To address the ques-

tion,wepilotedtheVoixdesKivussystembetween2009and2011inthewar-tornSouth
KivuprovinceoftheDRC.Reporterswereselectedfromrandomlysampledareas,pro-
vided cell phones and credit, and invited to provide regular reports to the system. This

approach holds out the promise of multiple benefits for data quality, which includes a
claim to representativeness and the possibility of collecting conflict event data in real
time.Byimplementingsuchacrowdseedingsystem,wehopetoovercometheproblems

that come with current methods to collect data on conflict.
   A first objective in this research was to probe the feasibility of employing a
crowdseeding approach to gathering high-quality data on conflict events in real time.

We found that users had the capacity and willingness to engage at high levels, the
technical implementation both at the village level and the processing level were
smooth. Also the costs required to collect data—especially compared to more tradi-

tional approaches—were relatively modest.
   A second goal was to illustrate the use and benefits of crowdseeding data. In a
first application, we took advantage of exogenous variation resulting from the ran-

dom implementation of a development project to assess whether aid is associated
with increased or reduced levels of violence. We implemented Voix des Kivus in
such a way that some Voix des Kivus villages received the development project and

others did not. Despite the small sample, we find evidence for a negative relationship
between aid and conflict. In a second application, we exploit the fine grain of the
data to examine conflict diffusion patterns. We find evidence that conflict events

shift from site to site but find that evidence for diffusion disappears at a resolution
of about fifty kilometers. Critically, by exploiting the continuous nature of our data,

both applications highlight the sensitivity of estimates to the timing of measurement
in a way that cannot be assessed from traditional cross-sectional data.
   Ultimately, however, the value of the system depends on the quality of the data

that it generates. Our initial probes, using validation by our agent in the field,
through comparison of reports across reporters, and through comparison with
survey data, suggest that the data are capturing major trends faithfully. However, the

data differ both qualitatively and quantitatively from that from other sources. Com-
parisons with ACLED data, for example, suggest a greater volume of events and a
higher attribution of conflict events to C ongolese government troops. Moreover,

high correlations in the reporting of different types of events as well as large var-
iation in the number of events reported by different areas suggest that accuracy may

be affected by uneven reporter engagement with the system. Given the promise of
the system, we believe that there is need now for more formal validation of data from

crowdseeding, perhaps in conjunction with a validation of crowdsourced data, that
would seek to assess rates of type I and type II errors relative to data systematically

collected through intensive application of traditional methods.
   We close with reflections on the ethical implications of taking a project like this
to scale. During the pilot project, we faced no incidents that threatened the safety of

the reporters. However, things might be different if a project of this form was scaled
up and attracted the interest of armed groups. For both humanitarian and research

purposes, a project such as Voix des Kivus becomes truly useful only when it is taken
to scale, but those are precisely the conditions that might create the greatest risks.

We did not assess these risks because we could not bear them ourselves. But given
the importance and utility of the data, these are risks that local and international
groups operating in these regions might be prepared to bear.

Notes

 1. Cohen and Arieli (2011) discuss how the populations in conflict areas are hidden from
    and hard to reach for researchers and argue how the ‘‘snowball surveying’’ method works

    to access such populations.
 2. Various approaches to get at sensitive information in these environments have recently

    been developed. See, for example, Corstange (2008).

 3. Luyendijk (2009), for example, discusses how in the Middle East the actors provide neatly

    packaged story lines to media reporters. A more subtle way to influence the data is for gov-
    ernmentorrebelgroupstograntaresearcheraccesstoonlycertainareasanddenyittoothers.

 4. Berinsky, Huber, and Lenz (2012), for example, find that information collected via
    Amazon’s Mechanical Turk—a particularly popular crowdsourcing system to collect data

    for experimental researchinpolitical science—isnot representative ofthe wider population.
 5. A Ushahidi-based crowdsourcing platform was introduced in Congo in 2008 to provide a

    platform to report on conflict events. The system fell out of use with only a handful of
    messages being received, despite many ongoing events, thus illustrating the risks of a sys-

    tem that depends on possibly weak supply incentives.
 6. The territory is the administrative unit below the province and above the chiefdom.

 7. The sampling frame and the code used to select the villages are available upon request.
 8. Note that to safeguard the safety of the reporters, the village names are omitted. More-

    over, locations within chiefdoms have been scrambled and so the actual location of
    participating villages cannot be inferred from the location of points on this map. We pro-

    vided information about village location only to precleared organizations. We thank
    United Nations Office of Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs for the shapefiles used

    to construct this map.
 9. The idea behind these three reporters is that the chief is the go-to person for many affairs

    in a village ranging from land conflict to marital disputes. The head of the women’s asso-
    ciation, on the other hand, is often the go-to person for issues such as domestic violence.

    Finally, one person is elected to decrease concerns of capture. These reporters can also be
    selected randomly to obtain a representative sample within the village.

10. All documents can be found on the project’s website: www.cu-csds.org/projects/event-
    mapping-in-congo/. This also includes the computer code to create bulletins and a ‘‘Voix

    des Kivus Implementation Guide’’ for organizations that want to set up a similar system.
11. While Voix des Kivus started as an academic exercise, such a system also has the potential

    to empower participating communities and provide a basis for response to practitioners
    and policy advocates (Van der Windt 2013). As a result, we set up a system in which each

    Monday a bulletin with event information was produced and disseminated to organiza-
    tions that had received clearance from Voix des Kivus and its reporters. Many of these

    organizations are based in Bukavu and have the means to respond.

     2010, December 8, 2010, and December 10, 2010. The village that started on August
     17, 2009, started later than expected because not enough people were present at the first

     general assembly. We had as rule that at least 40 percent of the village had to be present,
     be informed of the pilot project, and give their consent.

15. In fact, in January 2011, we sent a onetime US$20 of phone credit to the reporters with the
     message thatthisphone creditwasforthemtouse inanywaytheywant,thattheywouldstill

     be reimbursed for their messages, and that we would continue to collect short message ser-
     vice (SMS) messages and distribute the bulletins. However, we alsotold them that from that

     moment onward, they would no longer receive the weekly US$1.5, nor would they receive
     anyfeedbackfromthe system. Ascanbeseenfromthe toppanelinFigure 2, the resultwas a

     gradual decline in the messages sent from January 2011 onward reaching zero by July 2011.
16. Reporting by one reporter (the upper line) is anomalous. We noticed after one month

     that messages by this reporter had been sent to the wrong phone number. The reporter
     had recorded his messages in a notebook however and subsequently uploaded them to

     the system (resulting in the steep slope in October 2009).
17. This is based on the Frontline SMS export of August 1, 2011.

18. To do so, Voix des Kivus would prepare a sheet with the messages sent by that reporter in
     the preceding two weeks. For security reasons, these were decoded in such a way that the

     information only made sense to our field coordinator.
19. Theimprovementsand subsequentdecline invalidationmay inpartresultfromourcommu-

     nicationswithreporters.Consultingreporterssuggestedthatthelowinternalvalidationearly
     on was in part due to reporters informally adopting a division of labor where one would not

     send a message if they knew another had. In the early months with the first villages, we
     encouraged reporters not to do this and to report whether or not they thought others did also.

     This same messaging was not employed to the same extent with the later villages as they
     came online, and we see a subsequent drop in the level of internal validation.

20. And we note that even for these three Voix des Kivus villages, the survey took place
     during the final ‘‘voluntary’’ phase in which payments were no longer being made to

     reporters (see the third section).
21. This yields data of the form: f1,34,9,10 g, f1, 5, 2, 27g,and f0, 9, 7, 33g, denoting, respec-

     tively, the number of conflict events and nonconflict events measured by Voix des Kivus
     and the number of conflict and nonconflict events measured by the survey, by village.

22. We also note that in this case since the chief was also involved with Voix des Kivus, the
     comparison of systems involves comparing reports from the same actor, which may give

     rise to concerns that the two reports would be more similar than they would be if recorded
     from different subjects.

23. While positive correlations may be expected across many pairs of event types, we
     would expect a negative correlation at least for the incidence of flooding and of

     droughts. For this pair, we do indeed find a negative correlation, though it is small in
     magnitude (▯.02) and there are three village-months in which both events were reported.

24. There is also a large variation over time for these three types of reporters, with standard
     deviations of, respectively, 14.10, 7.54, and 13.44.

25. The share of conflict events reported over total events reported is 0.28 (0.30), 0.32 (0.33),

    0.34 (0.33), respectively, for the chief, the women’s representative, and the elected
    reporter (standard deviation in parentheses). On average, they sent, respectively, 2.81

    of Kalehe, Walungu, Mwenga, and Uvira.
28. The column ‘‘Total’’ in Table 1 presents this result disaggregated by event type.

29. The twenty-seven events were sourced from Africa Research Bulletin, Agence France
    Presse, All Africa, Associated Press Newswires, Associated Press Newswires, British

    Broadcasting Corporation, and Reuters.
30. ACLED collect information on the dyad characteristics of conflict events subdividing the

    twenty-seven events into sole military action (1▯), military versus rebels (8▯), military
    versus political militia (1▯), military versus civilians (2▯), military versus other (1▯),

    sole rebel action (2▯), rebels versus political militia (2▯), rebels versus civilians (5▯),
    political militia versus civilians (4▯), and political militia versus others (1▯). Violence

    against civilians corresponds closely to our definition of attack on the villages (codes
    21–24). ACLED has a total of eleven such events, while Voix des Kivus has 103.

31. Voix desKivus:UnitedNationsOrganizationStabilizationMissionintheDRCongo(MON-
    USCO; 8, 6 percent), Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo (FARDC; 58, 46

    percent), rebel (43, 34 percent), and unknown (18, 14 percent). ACLED: MONUSCO (0, 0
    percent), FARDC (2, 18 percent), rebel (6, 55 percent), and unknown (3, 27 percent).

32. Specifically, this is the period February , 12, 1997, to December, 12, 2012. The break-
    down by perpetrator is as follows: FARDC (25, 10 percent), Rebel (190, 80 percent),

    and unknown (24, 10 percent).
33. See, for example, Zeitzoff (2011) who draws data on hourly conflict intensity from

    Twitter and other social media to learn about the Gaza Conflict (2008–2009).
34. This is an important question that we should also ask in the ‘‘Application 1: The Conflict

    Impact of Development Programs’’ section where we analyze the conflict impact of a
    development program. Does this program decrease the level of violence or is violence

    simply moved to another area? We do not answer this question in the article. In the
    ‘‘Application 2: Spatial Clustering and Diffusion of Conflict’’ subsection, we do investi-

    gate the use of crowdseeding data to learn about conflict diffusion in more general.
35. See also Collier (2003) and Bates (2009).

36. In addition, little work exists that ties both levels together. See for a particular strong
    illustration of the disconnect between the micro and macro levels in the Democratic

    Republic of Congo: Autesserre (2010).
37. All p values in the analyses in this subsection are based upon two-tailed tests, given the

    uncertain expectations over the direction of the average effects of aid.
38. See also Barrios et al. (2012); Small, Have, and Rosenbaum (2008); and Ho and Imai

    (2006). The analyses take into account that not each village had the same probability
    to be selected into the Tuungane program.

39. These lines start at November 2010 for two reasons. first, as the bottom panel of Figure 2

    illustrates, Voix des Kivus’ expansion was only gradual: three villages were added in
    August 2010, four during October 2010, and so on. Second, the monthly estimates are

    based upon data from that month and the preceding two months.
40. Other approaches to deal with the multiple comparisons problem include using an index

    of measures (e.g., the approach adopted by Kling, Liebman, and Katz (2007)), statistical
    adjustments, such as the Bonferroni or S ida ˇ  ´k corrections (see also Benjamini and

    Hochberg [1995], for methods to control the false discovery rate) or multilevel
    approaches (Gelman, Hill, and Yajima 2009).

41. Each regression is thus for the whole period under study.
42. We highlight that this test assesses the sharp null of no effect for any unit. The effects we

    observe are consistent with a spillover effect in which conflict shifted from treated units
    to control units and we cannot rule out this possibility in the current analysis.

43. Analyzing both sources of variance directly, we find that the variance in estimated
    effects depends strongly on the timing of m easurement. Starting from month 4, the

    variance in estimates of the treatment effect over months 4 through 24 is 194; the
    average variance within each period, however, is just 12. Things settle down after

    month 6, but even still the variance in estimates over time (months 7–24) is 12 while
    the average variance is 11.

44. Another channel found to be important is the negative impact of conflict on regional
    economic growth, which lowers the opportunity costs of rebellion in neighboring areas

    (Murdoch and Sandler 2002).
45. For historical roots, see Prunier (1997, 2009).

46. See Humphreys (2008). Such conflict-induced migration has also been characteristic for
    the region in more recent years due to sustained rebel activity and military operations by

    the government such as the 2009 joint Congo-Rwanda military offensive Umoja Wetu
    against the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, followed by Kimia II and

    Amani Leo.
47. Note that including this summation term means the results are sensitive to the number of

    villages in the data set and thus controlling for temporal fixed effects is important. This is
    not an issue in our analysis below because the number of villages is fixed for the period

    chosen for analysis.
48. The interpretation is that there is the own-village lag effect and also the ‘‘neighbor’’ lag

    effect, and we are looking at the latter conditional on the former.
49. Note that there are biases from estimating fixed effects with lagged dependent variables

    that disappear when the number of time periods is large (Nickell 1981).
50. This area includes five of our Voix des Kivus villages: the upper five villages in Figure 1.

    The migration data can be found online: www.petervanderwindt.com/research.
51. Specifically, to simulate this setup in our data, we group six months for which we have

    information from all villages (November–April, 2011) into two periods each consisting of
    those conflict events that took place over three months.

52. Crowdseeded data can also be analyzed at a more fine-grained level such as by day or—if
    the data allow it—hour. We do not do so in this article.

53. Fixed effects in the presence of a lagged dependent variable runs a risk of bias, especially

    for short panels (Arellano and Bond 1991). An advantage of real-time data however is
    that panels can quickly become longer than wide.
