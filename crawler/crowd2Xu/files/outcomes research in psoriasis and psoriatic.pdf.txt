Using Large Databases and Research Networks:

A Report from the GRAPPA 2013 Annual Meeting

April W. Armstrong, Joel M. Gelfand, and Amit Garg


     ABSTRACT. Advances in healthcare informatics have increased the ability to address real-world, clinically
                 relevant questions using large databases. When examining data sources, researchers and clinicians
                 need to consider data validity, potential sources of misclassification, whether the source is suffi-
                 ciently powered to detect clinically relevant differences, ability to obtain longitudinal data,
                 containment of patients within a database, and ability to obtain structured point-of-care data.
                 Population-based databases create opportunities for characterizing natural history of psoriatic
                 diseases, conducting comparative effectiveness research, determining comorbidities, and providing
                 epidemiology-based rational approaches to mechanistic investigations. Herein, we discuss the major

                 data sources for clinical research in psoriasis, including electronic medical records, research
                 networks, disease registries, and others. (J Rheumatol 2014;41:1233–6; doi:10.3899/jrheum.140178)
