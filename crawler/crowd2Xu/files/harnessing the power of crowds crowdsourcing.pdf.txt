AbStrOCt                 Background: Crowdsourcing is a novel process of data collection that can provide insight into the effec-
                         tiveness of acne treatments in real-world settings. Little isknown regarding the feasibility of crowdsourcing
                         as a means of collecting dermatology research data, thequality of collected data, and how the data compare

                         to the published literature.
                         Objective: The objective of this analysis is to compare acnedata collected from a medical crowdsourcing site
                         with high-quality controlled studies from peer-reviewed medical literature.
                         Methods:Crowdsourced data wascollected from 662online acnepatients. Online patients reported data ina

                         Likert-type format to characterize their symptom severity (740 total responses) and their treatment out-
                         comes (958total responses). Thecrowdsourced data werecompared with meta-analyses and reviewson acne
                         treatment from August 20, 2010 to August 20, 2011.
                         Results: We compared topical, oral systemic, alternative, phototherapy, and physical acne treatments of
                         crowdsourced data to published literature. We focused on topical tretinoin due to the large number of online

                         patient responses. While approximately 80% of tretinoin users observed clinical improvement after a
                          12-week treatment period in clinical trials,46% of online users reported improvement in an unspecified time
                         period. For most topical treatments, medication with high effieacy in clinical trials did not produce high
                         effectiveness ratings based on the crowdsourced online data.

                         Conclusion: While limitations exist with the current methods of crowdsourced data collection, with stand-
                         ardization ofdata collection and useof validated instruments, crowdsoureing willprovide an important and
                         valuable platform for collecting high-volume patient data in real-world settings.
