Abstract


           Morbidity and mortality associated with an infectious disease outbreak can be mitigated by early
           detection followed by swift action. Modelling, tracking and predicting disease outbreaks are

           therefore priorities for public health agencies. New media data sources, including social media
           platforms, the internet and mobile phone applications, now aid in detecting outbreaks earlier than

           would have been possible using traditional surveillance methods alone. I review the literature on
           uses of new media methods for detecting disease outbreaks in humans and animals, with a focus on
           veterinary diseases and the difference in challenges compared with human disease surveillance.

           I then discuss the complex issue of evaluation of new media-based surveillance systems. The
           proliferation of new media methods for disease surveillance has not included published evaluation

           of each method or of the challenges faced, which limits the potential for a particular method to be
           applied outside its original context.


Keywords: Surveillance, Infectious disease outbreaks, Telemedicine, Veterinary, Internet,
Social media, Mobile

Review Methodology: I searched the following databases: Google Scholar, CAB Direct, ScienceDirect/Scopus and Web of Knowledge

(keyword search terms used: disease surveillance, novel method, mobile, new media, internet and outbreak prediction). Articles were
considered relevant for inclusion if the title and/or abstract referred to the use of new media methods (such as mobile, internet) for
infectious disease surveillance or outbreak modelling in any species. All abstracts from three conferences, the 2011 International
Meeting on Emerging Diseases and Surveillance, the 2011 International Conference on Animal Health Surveillance and the 2012
International Symposium on Veterinary Epidemiology and Economics were screened for inclusion. References from articles obtained by
the above method were checked for additional relevant material, and in some cases speciﬁc searches were conducted for follow-up

information on a particular item. Recommendations by colleagues of relevant papers were also considered.
