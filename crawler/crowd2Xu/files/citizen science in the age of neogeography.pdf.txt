                      The interface between neogeography and citizen science has great potential for environmental monitoring, but
                      this nexus has been explored less often than each subject individually. In this article we review the emerging
                      role of volunteered geographic information in citizen science and present a case study of an integrated tool set

                      that engages multiple types of users (from targeted citizen-based observation networks, expert-driven focused
                      monitoring, and opportunistic crowdsourcing efforts) in monitoring a forest disease in the western United States.
                      We ﬁrst introduce the overall challenge of data collection in environmental monitoring projects and then discuss

                      the literature surrounding an emergent integration of citizen science and volunteered geographical information.
                      We next explore how these methods characterize and underpin knowledge discovery and how multimodal
                      interaction is supported so that a large spectrum of contributors can be included. These concepts are summarized
                      in a conceptual model that articulates the important gradients of Web-based environmental monitoring: the

                      users, the interaction between users and data, and the types of information generated. Using this model, we
                      critically examine OakMapper.org, a Web site created by the authors to collect and distribute spatial information
                      related to the spread of a forest disease, and discuss many of the core issues and new challenges presented by

                      the intersection of citizen science and volunteered geographic information in the context of environmental
                      monitoring. We argue that environmental monitoring can beneﬁt from this synergy: The increased emphasis on
