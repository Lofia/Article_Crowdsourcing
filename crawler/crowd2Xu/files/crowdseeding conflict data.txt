         Poor quality data about conict events can hinder humanitarian responses and
      bias academic research. There is increasing recognition for the role new information

      technologies can play in producing more reliable data faster. We piloted a novel data-
      gathering system in the Democratic Republic of Congo in which villagers in a set
      of randomly selected communities report on events in real time via SMS. We ▯rst

      describe the data and assess its reliability. We then examine the usefulness of such
      \crowdseeded" data in two ways. First, we implement a downstream experiment on
      aid and conict and ▯nd evidence that aid can lead to fewer conict events. Second,

      we examine conict di▯usion in Eastern Congo and ▯nd evidence that key dynamics
      operate at very micro levels.  Both applications highlight the bene▯t of collecting
      conict data via cell phones in real time.

1    Introduction

Information technology is becoming increasingly visible as a means for gathering data on

social trends. Web-based social networks are used to organize, mobilize and coordinate
activities|from riots in London to regime change in the Middle East. Satellite imagery
is used by the UNHCR to track population movements during conicts or droughts, and

by the ICC to learn about the presence of mass-graves in Bosnia. And cell phones, com-
bined with geo-mapping software, are used to create early-warning systems. Information

technology is now also employed prominently in research. Satellite imagery has been used
to study economic growth (Henderson et al., 2011, 2012), Twitter to learn about the Gaza
Conict (Zeitzo▯ (2011)), and GIS data to assess many elements of conicts (Lujala, 2010;

Raleigh and Hegre, 2009; Lujala et al., 2005; Weidmann et al., 2010; Raleigh et al., 2010).
    Despite broad interest in understanding patterns of political violence, the development

of micro-level measures remains weak. There have been improvements in data collection on
violence but this data is typically at a high a level of aggregation. As Verwimp et al. (2009)
argue: \At a fundamental level, conict originates from individuals’ behavior and their re-

peated interactions with their surroundings, in other words, from its micro-foundations
(p.307)." Recent work by Autesserre in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) illus-

trates the point: Although the war o▯cially came to an end in 2003, thousands of civilians
still die each week. A plausible reason is that international interventions have focused at the
regional and national levels; ignoring the local level where conicts over land and political
                                                                                       1
power became self-sustaining and autonomous from the national and regional tracks.
    Micro-level conict data is normally collected by conducting surveys or interviews.
However, obtaining such data in real-time using traditional approaches is di▯cult because

conict events cluster in areas that have three characteristics. First, they are insecure,
which limits the ability of researchers to visit them. Second, they are often physically

hard-to-access (indeed di▯cult terrain is signi▯cantly related to a higher incidence of civil
war (Fearon and Laitin, 2003)). Third, they may exhibit high levels of societal suspicion
and distrust due to, for example, recent conict experiences or the inux of new, unknown

people due to displacement. These characteristics can create di▯erent types of biases that
a▯ect data quality.

    First are selection biases. If areas are o▯-limits while conict events take place, re-
searchers often access and enlist the cooperation of only a (non-random) fraction of the
research populations. 2 Such selection biases may arise in subtle ways|for example, even

if all areas are covered by a survey, security considerations may result in scheduling ad-
justments so that di▯erent regions are only visited when it is safe to do so. Other biases
obtain with recall data since testimonies are only taken from the living.

    Second are risks of recall bias arising from the gathering of data after the conclusion
   1
    Autesserre (2009) and Autesserre (2010).
   2Cohen and Arieli (2011) discuss how the populations in conict areas are hidden from and hard to
reach for researchers, and argue how the \snowball surveying"-method works to access such populations.


                                              2
of conict. Coughlin (1990) provides an overview of the literature. While time cues might
lessen this bias in some cases, De Nicola and Gin▯     e (2014) ▯nd evidence that the use of

time cues can sometimes exacerbate the problem. One example is the problem of ‘telescop-
ing’ where respondents run together several events and lose track of when they actually

happened. The importance of prompt data collection then may depend on the number of
events taking place.

    Third are risks of reporting bias that may arise when sensitive questions are asked in
settings characterized by distrust and suspicion. Trust has to be created to obtain high-

quality responses. However, this is especially di▯cult in conict areas where data-collection
is a one-o▯ activity. 3 And of course, reporting may also be biased because of deliberate
                                        4
attempts to manipulate information.
    We seek to investigate how information technology can overcome the problems asso-

ciated with the collection of conict data. To do so we piloted a \crowdseeding" system
that collected information via SMS from pre-identi▯ed informants in randomly sampled

locations. The project, Voix des Kivus, was implemented between 2009 and 2011 in the
war-torn province of South Kivu in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Large parts

of the province are hard-to-access and although there is reasonable cell phone coverage,
access to cell phone technology is limited.

    In using cell phone technology we build o▯ the \crowdsourcing" approach pioneered
by groups such as Ushahidi. Under crowdsourcing, anyone can send an SMS-message to a

central platform in which messages are gathered, stored and visualized on a map. Though
clearly a compelling system for \▯re alarm" monitoring, there are reasons to worry that
                                                                      5
the data generated through such systems is not representative.           Reporters might send
incorrect information|for example they might over-report hardship|hoping for human-

itarian intervention. The data may also be unrepresentative for more innocent reasons;
only people with access to a cell phone (and who have heard about the project) can send

messages. Furthermore, the system will only receive messages from people that are willing
to pay the cost of an SMS.   6

    The crowdseeding approach seeks to combine the strengths of crowdsourcing technolo-
gies to generate detailed real time data, with the strengths of traditional approaches that

   3
    Various approaches to get at sensitive information in these environments have recently been developed.
See for example Corstange (2008).
   4Luyendijk (2009), for example, discusses how in the Middle East the actors provide neatly packaged
story lines to media reporters. A more subtle way to inuence the data is for government or rebel groups

to 5rant a researcher access to only certain areas, and deny it to others.
    Berinsky et al. (2012), for example, ▯nd that information collected via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk|a
particularly popular crowdsourcing system to collect data for experimental research in political science|is
not representative of the wider population.
   6A Ushahidi-based crowdsourcing platform was introduced in Congo in 2008 onwards to provide a

platform to report on conict events. The system fell out of use with only a handful of messages being
received, despite many ongoing events, thus illustrating the risks of a system that depends on possibly weak
supply incentives.



                                                3
rely on known sources and representative samples. Like crowdsourcing, crowdseeding can
alleviate some of the concerns regarding selection biases highlighted above. Rather than
relying on discrete retrospective data gathering, these approaches rely on continuous in-

formation ows from individuals in the conict region. Indeed even if an area is o▯-limits
to a research team, SMS-messages can still be sent and received. Moreover, real-time data
gathering removes concerns related to recall. Crowdseeding o▯ers additional advantages

relative to crowdsourcing. First, by working with a random set of villages, data from a
crowdseeding system renders data representative at the village level. Moreover, if the re-
porters are pre-identi▯ed and given the means to provide information, risks of self-selection

at the reporter level are reduced. And even in the event of (forced) displacements, the re-
porter can continue providing information. Finally, crowdseeding may alleviate concerns
associated with distrust since, by working with preselected reporters over extended peri-

ods, the system allows both for the generation of trust and for a greater ability to verify
received information. Repeated interactions can reduce the incentive for phone holders to
send incorrect information and allows for ready auditing and veri▯cation of data.

    In this paper we introduce data from the Voix des Kivus system and explore its utility
in practice. In Section 2 we describe the set up and feasibility of the system. We then

present the data in Section 3, describing the distribution of messages, and assessing the
overall data quality (Section 3.1). In assessing data quality we also seek to unpack the
\crowd," discussing how the data received depends on the identity of the senders (Sec-

tion 3.2). Moreover, we compare the system’s data with the best available alternative: the
ACLED dataset (Section 3.3). Section 4 provides two illustrations of the use of the data. In
Section 4.1 we assess the e▯ects of a downstream experiment on aid and conict, exploiting

additional data on the presence of a randomized development intervention in the region.
Despite the small sample, we ▯nd evidence for a negative relationship between aid and
conict in this set of villages. In Section 4.2 we use the data to assess the spatio-temporal

distribution of violence events. Though identi▯cation is weaker for this analysis, the evi-
dence is consistent with large local spillover e▯ects that decay at distances of around 50
km. Both applications suggests that the assessments are highly sensitive to the timing of

measurement in a way that often cannot be assessed from traditional conict data sources.
We conclude in Section 5 by considering ethical and practical implications of a scaling up
of this type of data system.



2    The Voix des Kivus System

The Voix des Kivus (literally \Voice of the Kivus") data collection system was piloted in

the province of South Kivu in the war-torn East of the Democratic Republic of Congo over
an 18 month period starting in August 2009. The pilot ran in eighteen villages spread over
four territories: Kalehe (5), Mwenga (4), Uvira (3), and Walungu (6).   7 Villages 1-4 were

   7The territory is the administrative unit below the province and above the chiefdom.



                                             4
selected purposely to ensure some conict and some non conict areas; villages 5-18 were
selected using strati▯ed random sampling from these territories. Speci▯cally, villages were

randomly selected strati▯ed by chiefdom and by the village’s treatment status of a large
development project (we will discuss the latter in more detail in Section 4.1), taking village
                                 8                                                         9
population sizes into account.     Figure 1 shows the approximate area of operation.          The
headquarters of Voix des Kivus was Bukavu|the capital city of South Kivu and also the

city where most of the province’s NGOs are located.
    Within these villages the Voix des Kivus system worked as follows. In each village we

identi▯ed three reporters (\phone holders"): one representing the traditional leadership
(the chief of the village or his appointee), one representing women’s groups (the head of
                                                                                      10
the women’s association or her appointee), and one elected by the community.
    Holders were given a phone and trained on how to send messages to the system. They

were provided with a codesheet that lists possible events that can take place in the village,
organized in ten categories: (1) presence of military forces, (2) attacks on the village, (3)

deaths related to armed combat, (4) local violence and property loss, (5) displacement, (6)
health events, (7) natural disasters, (8) development and NGO activities, (9) social events
                                                                             11
and (10) special codes. An overview of these codes is given in Table 1.         Users could send
a simple message containing one of these codes or they could send a standard \full text"

message giving more particulars.
    Phone holders automatically received weekly phonecredit that they could use freely,

and were reimbursed for the number of messages sent. Remaining in the system required
sending at least one message a week but this message could be blank.               Thus sending

messages to the system was free but it was also voluntary|while users did not have to pay
for each message, they did not get any marginal ▯nancial rewards for sending content either.

On the receiving side was a standard cell phone linked to a laptop computer. With freely
available software (FrontlineSMS and R), messages received were automatically ▯ltered,

coded for content, cleaned to remove duplicates, and merged into a database. Graphs and
tables were generated automatically and then mounted into bulletins with di▯erent levels

of source identi▯ability. Translations of non-coded text messages (often from Swahili or

   9Note that to safeguard the safety of the phone holders the village names are omitted.Moreover,

locations within chiefdoms have been scrambled and so the actual location of participating villages can not
be inferred from the location of points on this map. We provided information about village location only
to precleared organizations. We thank UNOCHA for the shape▯les used to construct this map.
  10The idea behind these three reporters is that the chief is the go-to person for many a▯airs in a village
ranging from land conict to marital disputes. The head of the women’s association, on the other hand,

is often the go-to person for issues such as domestic violence. Finally, one person is elected to decrease
concerns of capture. These reporters can also be selected randomly to obtain a representative sample within
the village.

Guide" for organizations that want to set up a similar system.

one of the local languages into French and English) were undertaken manually.       12

    Our ▯rst goal in implementing the pilot was to assess the feasibility of data collection of
this form. Establishing feasibility was important in light of a number of obvious challenges.

    A ▯rst concern was that capacity would be too weak for users to implement the project.
Indeed, 19 of our 54 reporters had only primary level education and only two had received
education beyond secondary school. This concern is likely to be present in many hard-to-

access areas where conict takes place. We mitigated this concern through a (minimum)
two-day training by the ▯eld coordinator and the use of relatively simple code books with

pre-coded events. In fact, over the eighteen months of operation Voix des Kivus received|
in addition to SMS-messages with codes|1,144 text-messages in Swahili or one of the

local languages; this suggests that the code book, while useful, was not necessary for many
holders.
    A second concern was technical capacity. On the receiving side a cheap netbook, a

phone and free software was su▯cient. However, things were di▯erent on the sending side.
Phone-coverage was not a problem|of the eighteen villages no village had to be replaced

after selection for lack of coverage. Electricity, however, was a problem with phone holders
sometimes walking up to three hours to charge their phone. The problem was solved by

purchasing $25 solar chargers and donating one to each Voix des Kivus village. These
concerns exist for many phone-based projects that operate in a hard-to-access area, but in

this case at least, turned out not to be important.
    A third concern, however, is speci▯c to crowdseeding systems: would participation in
the system produce security risks for phone holders? Over the course of eighteen months

Voix des Kivus received thousands of messages many of which were sensitive, including in-
formation on various types of abuses perpetrated by di▯erent actors. Because of the close

connection between individual holders and the project, we were concerned that there could
be reprisals against phone holders for sharing information. Beyond regular monitoring we

used three strategies to address this concern. First, we operated in just four villages at
▯rst and subsequent villages were added only after one year of careful monitoring. Sec-
ond, the weekly bulletins were generated in two versions. One version contained sensitive

information (with village identi▯ers), the other did not. The sensitive bulletins were only
disseminated to a very restricted set of organizations. Public versions contained no village

identi▯ers. Third, the system allowed phone holders to include a code (1-4) to a message
to indicate the event’s level of sensitivity, and with whom the information was to be shared

(\4" only with Voix des Kivus, \3" also with close partners, \2" also with MONUSCO, and
\1" everybody).  13  We found that at no point did any user indicate any security concern

  12While Voix des Kivus started as an academic exercise, such a system also has the potential to empower
participating communities, and provide a basis for response to practitioners and policy advocates (Van der

Windt (2013)). As a result, we set up a system in which each Monday a bulletin with event-information
was produced and disseminated to organizations that had received clearance from Voix des Kivus and its
phone holders. Many of these organizations are based in Bukavu and have the means to respond.
  13From the introduction of these codes in August 2010 onwards the project received 3,214 event-messages.



                                               7
of any form arising from their participation in the project. However, although no concerns
arose in our case, there are still general grounds for concerns for the security of the phone

holders in a crowdseeding system because of the direct link between phone holders and the
project. We return to this concern in the concluding section.



3     The Data


Voix des Kivus was launched in August 2009 and operated during the ▯rst twelve months

in only four villages. Then from August 2010 onwards the pilot project was expanded to
eighteen villages. The expansion over time is illustrated in the top left panel of Figure
  14
2.   The regular system continued through to January 2011 (the vertical line in Figure 2)
but remained open for users to send messages|though without incentives for reporters|
                        15
through to July 2011.
    The top right panel of Figure 2 shows the distribution of total event reports (dashed

line) and conict event reports (solid line) over time, per village. Overall the system
generated a relatively constant stream of messages over this period. As shown in the lower

left panel of Figure 2, reporters exhibited relatively little fatigue | while di▯erent phone
holders reported at di▯erent rates, they nevertheless reported at relatively constant rates
           16
over time.
    In this short period the project received a total of 4,783 non-empty SMS messages. The

phone holders sent messages about a total of 5,491 events of which 4,623 were unique|
many village events were thus reported by more than one phone holder. Of these non-


A total of 1,449 had a code that indicated the sensitivity of the message. Phone holders were willing to
distribute the data widely, with 1,076 messages (or 74% of those messages that included a code) being
designated for distribution to \everybody." Codes 2, 3 and 4 were used, respectively, 106, 92 and 175
times. The majority of event-messages (1,765 or 55% of all event-messages), however, did not have a

security code. Users suggested that this was not driven by a lack of understanding of the system, but by
their preference to leave the decision with whom to share what data with the project.
  14Dates that Voix des Kivus started: 1-Aug-09 (3x), 17-Aug-09, 10-Aug-10, 13-Aug-10 (2x), 9-Oct-10
(2x), 26-Oct-10, 30-Oct-10, 1-Nov-10, 2-Nov-10 (2x), 4-Nov-10, 6-Dec-10, 8-Dec-10, 10-Dec-10. The village
that started on 17-Aug-09 started later than expected because not enough people were present at the ▯rst

general assembly. We had as rule that at least 40% of the village had to be present, be informed of the
pilot project and give their consent.
  15In fact, in January 2011 we sent a one-time $20 of phonecredit to the phone holders with the message
that this phonecredit was for them to use in any way they want, that they would still be reimbursed for

their messages and that we would continue to collect SMS messages and distribute the bulletins. However,
we also told them that from that moment onwards they would no longer receive the weekly $1.5 nor would
they receive any feedback from the system. As can be seen from the top panel in Figure 2, the result was
a gradual decline in the messages sent from January 2011 onwards reaching zero by July 2011.
  16
    Reporting by one phone holder (the upper-line) is anomalous. We noticed after one month that messages
by this reporter had been sent to the wrong phonenumber. The reporter had recorded his messages in a
notebook however and subsequently uploaded them to the system (resulting in the steep slope in October
2009).

empty SMS messages 1,144 were text-messages.        Table 1 provides summary information
per event (where the unit of analysis is the village-month). Identical messages received

from the same reporter within 30 minutes of each other, and identical messages received
from di▯erent representatives in the same village within 24 hours of each other, are treated
as single events. The table also reports the total number of messages sent per event. We

▯nd a large concentration of messages reporting the presence of troops (685); the most
common conict events include looting (233), within village conict (196) and kidnappings

(134) | which in many cases involved forcing villagers to transport loads, in addition
to frequent reports of conict-related deaths (274) and violence between villagers (126).
Reports of sexual violence (99) indicate approximately equal numbers of men and women

victims. Other major categories include outbreaks of diseases (275) and deaths due to
disease (469), as well as crop failures (376).
    Tables 2 and 3 show conditional correlations between these reported events. Speci▯cally,

each table shows the bivariate relationships between the column event and the row event
as estimated by OLS, accounting for village ▯xed e▯ects. In accounting for ▯xed e▯ects

these numbers capture the \within village" correlation. Though we provide no causal
interpretations, a number of patterns seen in Table 2 are worth highlighting. First, we
see that the presence of troops is not itself a good predictor of conict related deaths

though it is strongly related to other types of violence (a category that includes looting
and forced labor). Reports of attacks are associated with all other conict and violent

events, especially displacement, but are only weakly associated with health events and
social events. Adverse health events are not directly associated with attacks, but they are
associated with displacement, disasters and local violence. General development actions

are associated with almost all events; and social activities (such as visits and meetings)
are associated with all events except troop presence, attacks, and conict deaths. Overall,
there is a clear clustering of bad things going together over time.

    Table 3 focuses on the more disaggregated measures and reveals a number of striking
correlations. First, presence by UN peacekeepers (MONUSCO) and government soldiers

(FARDC) tends to be highly correlated; but while FARDC presence is also correlated
with the presence of rebel or other identi▯ed groups, MONUSCO presence is not. This
pattern could reect either a greater propensity of FARDC to engage with or to collaborate

with rebel groups although it may also reect a greater di▯culty for reporters to positively
identify FARDC troops. Second, we see that while presence by MONUSCO or rebel groups

is generally associated with actions or attacks, this is not the case with FARDC whose
presence is more common in the villages without necessarily being associated with actions.
Third, we see that presence in itself is generally not strongly associated with civilian deaths

| the exception being the correlation between rebel presence and male deaths. Actions
by FARDC are very strongly associated with deaths, particularly women’s deaths. Actions
by MONUSCO are not associated with deaths and actions by rebels or unidenti▯ed groups

Table 1:     Voix des Kivus Code book & Summary Information. Mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum

are by village-month: a total of 213 observations. Events in the column \Total" add up to 5,491. When a text
message could not be hand-coded to an event (e.g. \33"), it would be assigned to a category (e.g. \30"). Codes

84-89 and 91-97 were introduced only during the expansion in August 2010. Before the expansion codes 98 and 99

were 83 and 84, respectively.

3.1      Data Quality


Voix des Kivus was implemented to assess the feasibility of using crowdseeding to gather


high-quality data. In the absence of a gold standard for conict event data it is di▯cult

to formally validate the approach employed here. Nevertheless ▯ve considerations on data

quality bear emphasis.


     First, in its ▯rst year Voix des Kivus employed a ▯eld coordinator to visit each of the
                                                                                                                              18
phone holders at least once every two weeks to assess the quality of the messages sent.


The coordinator would assess whether holders interpreted codes in the same way as the

researchers, whether respondents employed the correct codes given the events they wished

to report, and so on. Moreover, the ▯eld coordinator would verify whether events had


actually taken place and whether there were other events that took place that were not

reported. Throughout the pilot the coordinator found no instances of erroneous reports

of major conict events (incursions, assaults or killings) but did ▯nd numerous instances


where events were not communicated by one or all reporters, suggesting a vulnerability to

Type II errors.


   18
     To do so Voix des Kivus would prepare a sheet with the messages sent by that phone holder in the

preceding two weeks. For security reasons these were decoded in such a way that the information only

made sense to our ▯eld coordinator.

Unit is the village-month; numbers are estimated \marginal e▯ects" of column reports on


row reports given village ▯xed e▯ect; p values in parentheses. Data from month 16 to end

of period.





     Second, because Voix des Kivus distributed phones to three people per village we have


a measure of internal validation. The bottom right panel of Figure 2 shows the share of

events that were reported by at least two phone holders out of all events reported. We ▯nd


that internal validation was around 30% at the outset but increased after the project start
                                                                                                      19
until August 2010|the moment the project expanded to more villages.

     Third, we have a limited ability to compare event information received from the Voix


des Kivus system with that from data from a survey we implemented in the same region in

a similar period. In the latter we asked each village chief, how many events from a list of


potential events had taken place in the village in the preceding month. Our survey villages
                                                                                                                             20
overlapped with just three Voix des Kivus villages during the lifespan of the project.

We consider three ways of assessing the congruence of the survey and the Voix des Kivus


data. First, we compare the average number of each type of event across villages under each

approach. On average we ▯nd nearly twice as many reported events according to the survey.

In particular, there were higher numbers of children’s deaths due to conict, citizen deaths


due to natural causes, disease outbreaks, and funerals reported in the survey. Second,


   19The improvements and subsequent decline in validation may in part result from our communications

with phone holders. Consulting phone holders suggested that the low internal validation early on was in

part due to phone holders informally adopting a division of labor where one would not send a message if

they knew another had. In the early months with the ▯rst villages we encouraged holders not to do this

and to report whether or not they thought others did also. This same messaging was not employed to the

same extent with the later villages as they came online and we see a subsequent drop in the level of internal

validation.
   20
     And we note that even for these three the survey took place during the ▯nal ‘voluntary’ phase in which

payments were no longer being made to reporters (see Section 3).





                                                              13
despite the di▯erence in means, the correlation between these two measures of average
incidence is 46% which is substantively large and statistically signi▯cant. This suggests

that similar types of events get reported to the same relative extent under the two systems.
Third, we generate measures of the average incidence of conict and nonconict events for
                                                                                               21
each of the three villages using each of the two data sources, yielding 12 data points.
The correlation between the Voix des Kivus and survey estimates is low largely because of

one outlying observation in which a village reported a much higher incidence of army visits
under the Voix des Kivus system. If this outlier is dropped the correlation between the

Voix des Kivus and the survey based measure is 95%. These correlations are encouraging
although we note that survey measures are also subject to measurement error and bias,
                                                                                      22
and so on their own the correlations do not establish the reliability of the data.
    Fourth, a problem for any data-collection method in conict areas, including surveys, is

censorship. For example, informants might report fewer conict events precisely because of
the presence of armed groups and high levels of conict. In practice our reporters provided
detailed data on events even when troops were present or in the vicinity. Messages such

as \FARDC passed by [Village Omitted] and shot with guns at 5:30 am" and \A FARDC
soldier shot a woman" are not uncommon. And messages such as \FARDC kidnapped

people who were then forced to transport things" and \FARDC kidnapped people to build
a shelter for the soldiers" were received almost weekly by Voix des Kivus. In addition,

we observe many instances in which there is simultaneous reporting of the presence of
armed actors and adverse events of various kinds. Moreover, at no point did phone holders

indicate to us that they felt a need to censor reports.
    Finally, we note a concern of uneven reporter participation. The total quantity of

messages sent varies substantially across villages; from month 16 onwards, total reporting
varies from a low of 14 from one village to a high of 522 for another. Alongside this

broad variation is a positive correlation between reports of events of many types (as seen
in Tables 2 and 3). These patterns may reect true variation but they are also consistent
                                                     23
with variation in the overall activity of reporters.    As we demonstrate in the next section
we ▯nd mixed evidence on di▯erential behavior by reporter type. Nevertheless, we believe

that heterogeneity in propensities to report could be a fruitful focus of scrutiny in future
applications.

  21This yields data of the form: f1, 34, 9, 10g, f1, 5, 2, 27g and f0, 9, 7, 33g, denoting respectively the

number of conict events and nonconict events measured by Voix des Kivus and the number of conict
and nonconict events measured by the survey, by village.
  22We also note that in this case since the chief was also involved with Voix des Kivus the comparison
of systems involves comparing reports from the same actor, which may give rise to concerns that the two
reports would be more similar than they would be if recorded from di▯erent subjects.
  23
    While positive correlations may be expected across many pairs of event types, we would expect a
negative correlation at least for the incidence of ooding and of droughts. For this pair we do indeed ▯nd a
negative correlation, though it is small in magnitude (▯0:02) and there are three village-months in which
both events were reported.

3.2    Source Dependence

A crowdsourcing system receives information from an unidenti▯ed, anonymous public. A

crowdseeding system, in contrast, makes use of identi▯able users. The ability to analyze
the \crowd" in more detail and learn whether particular types of reporters provide di▯erent

information is a signi▯cant bene▯t.
    In the case of Voix des Kivus, a reporter’s position (chief, women’s representative or
elected individual) is a natural starting point to di▯erentiate the crowd. We ▯nd that village

chiefs sent substantially more messages than the women’s representative or the elected
holder: respectively 11.71, 8.34 and 9.05 messages per person per month on average.       24

    Subdividing the data by conict and non-conict events we ▯nd that around 30% of the
messages sent concern conict events|with elected holders sending relatively the most.       25
Regressing the number of conict events reported per month on the type of phone holder

and the number of nonconict events reported in that month|with the chief as baseline and
standard errors clustered at the village level|partially con▯rms this. We obtain estimates

equal to 0.28 (0.62) and 1.56 (1.36) for the women’s representative and the elected holder
respectively (standard errors in parentheses). These di▯erences in messaging by reporter-

position are not statistically signi▯cant however.
    Reporters may nevertheless di▯er in the types of events they report. A major task of
the chief is to settle disputes among villagers (in particular those over land). Another is to

be the village’s ▯rst point of contact for visitors such as migrants, government o▯cials, etc.
In contrast, the head of the women’s association may be the go-to person for women that

experience sexual violence or domestic violence. On the other hand, our three reporters
are likely to be similarly aware of such events as funerals and weddings, and activities such

as road repairs and construction of the school, because Congolese villages are small and
these events are public. Table 4 in the Appendix presents the average number of messages
sent per village-month by reporter type, where we also tests the di▯erence between them.

On average, chiefs send more messages regarding land conict (code 44) than women rep-
resentatives, but fewer than elected holders|only the ▯rst di▯erence is slightly signi▯cant.

Chiefs|compared to elected phone holders|are statistically more likely to report the ar-
rival of refugees and IDPs (53), and visits or meetings organized by the chiefdom or locality
authorities (95) and by representative of a political party (96). We do not ▯nd that the

women representatives report more domestic violence (45) or more sexual violence against
women (64).

    The crowd is not a random subset of the total population and in general what one
learns likely depends on who one asks. Overall, however, our analysis suggests that in this

  24There is also a large variation over time for these three types of phone holders, with standard deviations
of respectively 14.14, 7.54, and 13.56.
  25The share of conict events reported over total events reported is 0.27 (0.29), 0.32 (0.32), 0.34 (0.33)

respectively for the chief, the women’s representative, and the elected phone holder (standard deviation in
parentheses). On average they sent respectively 2.84 (5.94), 2.19 (2.50), 3.20 (7.45) messages concerning
conict per month.


                                              15
data at least di▯erences in reporting across the three categories of reporters in the Voix
des Kivus villages is relatively muted.



3.3    Relation with ACLED data

We close our discussion of data quality with a comparison of data from the system and data

from what we believe is the best available alternative: the Armed Conict Location and
Events (ACLED) dataset, which gathers together data on the speci▯c dates and locations

of conict events, as well as ancillary information such as the types of event and the groups
involved (Raleigh et al. (2010)).  26  The dataset is global in reach, and for the DRC the

dataset contains 6,926 conict events since January 1, 1997.
    Because conict clusters in isolated areas one bene▯t of a crowdseeding system is that

it records conict events that otherwise would have gone unnoticed. To test this idea we
compare the number of conict events reported to Voix des Kivus with the number of
                                                                               27
conict events reported by ACLED for the same region and time period.              The ACLED
database reports 27 conict events divided over the following event types: battle with

no change of territory control, battle with rebel control location, battle with government
regaining territory, headquarters or base establishment, non-violent activity by a conict

actor, rioting/protesting, violence against civilians, and non-violent transfer of location
control. During this same period Voix des Kivus, on the other hand, reports a total of

1,240 unique conict events, and this increases to 1,813 conict events if the presence
of conict actors is included.  28  This di▯erence in number of conict events reported is

particularly large considering that Voix des Kivus reports events for only 18 villages, while
ACLED reports conict events for the whole area.

    Alongside these quantitative di▯erences there may be qualitative di▯erences reecting,
for example, the di▯erences in the sources upon which these data are based. The ACLED

dataset derives information from a variety of sources, which include news reports, human-
                                               29
itarian agencies, and research publications.       Voix des Kivus, on the other hand, relies
on reporting by individual reporters. To examine di▯erences, we focus on measures of
                                             30
who perpetrates violence against civilians.     This is a sensitive topic and di▯erent reports
  26
    ACLED data can be download freely at: http://www.acleddata.com/data/. The ▯le used has been
last updated on January 1. 2013.
  27That is, the period August 1, 2009 to December 31, 2010, and South Kivu’s territories of Kalehe,
Walungu, Mwenga, and Uvira.
  28
    The column \Total" in Table 1 presents this result disaggregated by event type.
  29The 27 events were sourced from Africa Research Bulletin, AFP, All Africa, Associated Press Newswires,
Associated Press Newswires, BBC, and Reuters.
  30ACLED collects information on the dyad characteristics of conict events subdividing the 27 events into:

sole military action (1▯), military versus rebels (8▯), military versus political militia (1▯), military versus
civilians (2▯), military versus other (1▯), sole rebel action (2▯), rebels versus political militia (2▯), rebels
versus civilians (5▯), political militia versus civilians (4▯), political militia versus others (1▯). Violence
against civilians corresponds closely to our de▯nition of attack on the villages (codes 21-24). ACLED has

a total of eleven such events, while Voix des Kivus has 103.


                                               16
might under or over-report the importance of one actor or another. Both ACLED and
Voix des Kivus separate out violence against civilians by perpetrator. The Voix des Kivus
data indicates that FARDC is an important perpetrator of violence against civilians, being

responsible for almost 50% of the attacks against civilians. ACLED, on the other hand,
indicates that most violence against civilians is perpetrated by rebel groups, and less than
                                                         31
20% of the violence is initiated by government soldiers.    This number drops to 10% when
analyzing the ACLED data for the whole period (totaling 239 attacks against civilians).      32

The two datasets thus paint a very di▯erent picture when it comes to who perpetrates
conict against civilians.



4    Research Applications


A system like Voix des Kivus provides rich data to learn about conict areas. Relationships
between di▯erent event types can be analyzed as we did in Section 3. Particular use can

be made of the data’s panel-component to learn about the dynamics of di▯erent events
over time.33 Another interesting application of a phone-based system is to combine it with

external data-sources, and use the data collected by phone as an outcome measure. The
local United Nations o▯ces could provide historic information about patrol routes which
can then be used to learn whether these patrols pacify a region or simply move violence

by a rebel group from one area to another.    34 The data could be combined with satellite
information about weather patterns to learn about the impact of, for example, rainfall

on di▯erent types and levels of conict.      To learn about election violence, data could
be collected from Congo’s National Election Committee on the location of voting booths

(in November 2011 the presidential elections took place in Congo and was in some areas
characterized by high levels of violence). Another possibility is to use a Voix des Kivus

style system as a treatment in order to examine the e▯ects of transparency on conict
outcomes of interest.

    In this section we provide two applications, where Voix des Kivus data provides outcome
data, to illustrate the utility of this kind of data for research. First, we try to assess the

conict impact of development aid. Second, we use the data to learn about the temporal-
spatial nature of conict. In both cases we highlight ways in which the conclusions we

draw might di▯er from conclusions that we might draw using more traditional approaches.

    Voix des Kivus: MONUSCO (6, 6%), FARDC (49, 48%), rebel (32, 31%), unknown (16, 15%). ACLED:
MONUSCO (0, 0%), FARDC (2, 18%), rebel (6, 55%), unknown (3, 27%).
  32Speci▯cally, this is the period February, 12, 1997 to December, 12, 2012. The breakdown by perpetrator
is as follows: FARDC (25, 10%), Rebel (190, 80%), unknown (24, 10%).
  33
    See, for example, Zeitzo▯ (2011) who draws data on hourly conict intensity from Twitter and other
so34al media to learn about the Gaza Conict (2008|2009).
    This is an important question that we should also ask in Section 4.1 where we analyze the conict
impact of a development program. Does this program decrease the level of violence, or is violence simply
moved to another area? We do not answer this question in the paper. In Section 4.2 we do investigate the
use of crowdseeding data to learn about conict di▯usion in more general.

4.1    Application 1: The Conict Impact of Development Programs

There is broad recognition that development and conict are closely related. Major de-

velopment interventions focus on countries emerging from war and include reintegration,
reconstruction, capacity building and other initiatives. It remains unclear however if and
how these investments are e▯ective. It is expected that by improving the level of devel-

opment, these projects could reduce risks of violence. Miguel et al. (2004), for example,
▯nd that economic growth is strongly negatively related to civil conict. And De Ree

and Nillesen (2009) argue that foreign aid is found to have a direct negative impact on
the probability of an ongoing civil conict to continue.   35 On the other hand, the very
introduction of development actors, ▯nancing, and projects could also increase violence.

Nunn and Qian (2013), for example, suggest that U.S. food aid increases the incidence,
onset and duration of civil conicts in recipient countries and related arguments have been

made by Anderson (1999), De Waal (2009), and Polman (2011). There are multiple rea-
sons why these relations|or opposite relations|may obtain. These include changing the
resource(s) available for looting, changing the capacity of local communities to respond,

changing the incentives of local communities to participate in violence, and increasing the
extent to which communities are|or are believed to be|monitored by external actors.

    Much of this development-conict literature is at the macro, often the national, level.
Conict research at the micro-level, and in particular the impact of development aid on
local levels of violence, is sparse and what does exist has up to recently been largely of
                     36
a descriptive nature.    This is not surprising because attempts to ▯nd out whether these
aid programs actually have an impact on the level of violence face major identi▯cation and

measurement challenges (for recent studies that seek to address the identi▯cation challenge
at the micro level see Berman et al. (2011); Crost et al. (2012); Beath et al. (2011)).
    This section shows how crowdseeded data can be coupled with a downstream exper-

iment to address these problems at the micro level. Between 2007-2011 a DFID-funded
randomized development intervention was implemented by the International Rescue Com-

mittee and CARE International throughout Eastern Congo|including the province of
South Kivu. The villages were selected into the development program by a public lottery|
thus in expectation treatment and control villages are alike in all respects except for the

intervention itself. The development project provided communities with ▯nancing of up to
$70,000 to construct local projects such as school rooms or clinics|part of this money was

received and managed by the communities directly. The intervention followed a \do no
harm" approach | that is, the projects were implemented in a way that sought to ensure
that they did not spark local conicts. During the selection of the Voix des Kivus villages

we took account of the random assignment of this development intervention, stratifying our
sample upon the villages’ treatment status in order to obtain balance between the number

  35See also Collier (2003) and Bates (2009).
  36In addition, little work exists that ties both levels together. See for a particular strong illustration of

the disconnect between the micro and macro levels in the DRC: Autesserre (2010).


                                             18
of Voix des Kivus villages that had the development program and those that did not.

    Even with a small sample such as we have, random assignment ensures that simple
di▯erence in means provides an unbiased estimate of the treatment e▯ect. Of course with

a small sample our power is weak and we can expect our estimates to be somewhat noisy,
though this does not threaten unbiasedness (see for example Mutz and Pemantle (2011);

Imai et al. (2008)).
    The top line in Figure 3’s top left panel shows the estimated impact of development

aid on the incidence of conict using simple di▯erences in means. The points are estimates
calculated for each month, based upon village-month data for that month and the preceding
two months. The gray area indicates the 95% con▯dence interval, where the standard errors
                                                                                               37
are clustered at the village level. The bottom line shows the corresponding p-values.
Conict events are measured as the message-codes: 21-56, 64-65, and 99. Note that this

construction separates the troop presence measures from the violent event measures. Two
results stand out. First, we see that the magnitudes vary over time, with strong estimates

of e▯ects in early periods which then decline and reemerge, though never to initial levels.
Second, the data provides evidence of a positive impact of development aid: that is, villages

with the development program have a lower level of conict incidence. Not only are the
point estimates of the development impact consistently below the zero line, so are most of

the 95% con▯dence intervals, which is reected in the fact that the majority of estimated
p-values (13/22) are at or below 0.1.
    A set of robustness checks, presented in the other three panels in Figure 3, give fur-

ther con▯dence in these results. First, we provide results using a randomization inference
procedure (Fisher, 1935).  38  We repeatedly randomly re-assigned our eighteen villages to

the treatment and for each of these new re-assignments to treatment we calculated the
distribution of possible estimated e▯ect under the null of no e▯ect. We then estimated how

likely it is we would have obtained results as strong or stronger than we did under this null.
These results are presented in the top right panel of Figure 3. using this approach we we

▯nd 7/22 of the estimated p-values at or below 0.1, and 5/22 below 0.05. Note that in the
early periods in which there are only 4 villages the p values from randomization inference

can never drop below 0.25, correctly reecting the severely restricted set of permutations
that are possible with this small set of cases. In later periods, where it is technically
possible to have lower p values, these values drop to below standard thresholds.

    In this ▯gure we also include shorter, thin lines that are estimated when we restrict our
analysis to exclude the ▯rst four purposefully selected villages that entered the system.      39

  37All p values in the analyses in this sub-section are based upon two-tailed tests given the uncertain

ex38ctations over the direction of the average e▯ects of aid.
    See also: Barrios et al. (2012), Small et al. (2008), and Ho and Imai (2006).
  39These lines start at November 2010 for two reasons. First, as the bottom panel of Figure 2 illustrates,
Voix des Kivus’ expansion was only gradually: three villages were added in August 2010, four during
October 2010, etc. Second, the monthly estimates are based upon data from that month and the preceding

two months.

Figure 3: Conict Impact of Development Aid. The top left panel shows estimated e▯ects


(top black line) based on data for that month and the preceding two months, including 95%


con▯dence intervals (gray area) and the corresponding p-values (bottom black line). The

top right panel presents results of the randomization inference for the full sample and the


restricted sample). The restricted sample drops the initial four villages. The bottom left


panel presents results where conict events reported by one (two) individuals are weighted

one-third (one-half) as much as those reports reported by three individuals. Based on ac-


cumulated data over time, the bottom right panel shows results of randomization inference

for the full sample and the restricted sample.





                                                             20
Surprisingly, we ▯nd that excluding the ▯rst four Voix des Kivus villages makes little
di▯erence to our estimates. The estimates, con▯dence intervals and p-values are almost
identical.

    In a second robustness check we leverage the possibility for internal validation of crowd-
seeded data. Recall that each event can be reported by one, two or all three of our reporters.

Because we are more con▯dent that events reported by three individuals have taken place
(or have been substantially important), we regard those conict events reported by one

(two) individuals one-third (one-half) as much as those events reported by three individu-
als. Results are presented in the bottom left panel in Figure 3. The overall results are very

similar to those from the main analysis although the magnitudes (p values) are generally
somewhat lower (higher). Finally, the lower right panel of the ▯gure shows comparable

results for the cumulative e▯ects; here again p values fall as the sample expands; using the
full sample the e▯ects are strongest though this in part reects the e▯ects induced by the

▯rst set of villages. As shown by the thinner lines on the graph however the results are not
very sensitive to dropping these units.

    Figure 3 reports results for each month. Given this collection of ▯ndings can we conclude
that the project led to less conict overall? That is, while in most periods the estimates

are negative and statistically signi▯cant, there are periods in which the estimate is not
signi▯cantly di▯erent from zero. This gives rise to a multiple comparisons problem. We
again use randomization inference to address this problem.       40  Speci▯cally, we repeatedly

randomly re-assigned our eighteen villages to the treatment to generate a distribution of
estimated e▯ects for the entire period under the sharp null of no e▯ect for any unit.      41 We

then assess how likely it is that we would have obtained results as strong or stronger than
we did. We calculate a p-value of 0.01 for the full period and 0.04 for the restricted period.

This cumulative evidence suggests that the positive e▯ect we estimate for the development
project is unlikely due to chance even for this small sample.    42

    This analysis has been implemented using a very small number of cases from a relatively
small part of Congo, and we therefore do not pretend to make a general claim here for the

relation between development aid and conict. Our goal here is to illustrate the promise of
a real-time system such as Voix des Kivus. Our analysis points, we think, to an important

advantage of real time data for the assessment of causal e▯ects. Existing studies of the
e▯ects of development interventions often produce contradictory results. Yet, these studies

di▯er on many dimensions of design, including the temporal lag between intervention and
measurement. An analysis using real-time data allows one to measure the extent to which

  40Other approaches to deal with the multiple comparisons problem include using an index of measures
(the approach adopted by Kling et al. (2007) for example), statistical adjustments, such as the Bonferroni
   ▯
or Sid▯k corrections (see also Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) for methods to control the false discovery
rate), or multi-level approaches (Gelman et al., 2009).
  41Each regression is thus for the whole period under study.
  42We highlight that this test assesses the sharp null of no e▯ect for any unit. The e▯ects we observe are
consistent with a spillover e▯ect in which conict shifted from treated units to control units and we cannot

rule out this possibility in the current analysis.


                                               21
the variance in estimated e▯ects depends on the timing of measurement. For example,

measures of conict events that took place in the month prior to data collection might
yield an estimated e▯ect with low variance. However, while this within-period variance is

low, the across-period variance might be high: very di▯erent estimates might have been
produced if data were gathered a month earlier or a month later. The top left panel in
Figure 3 suggests the timing of measurement contributes a large share of the true variance in
                                43
estimates of treatment e▯ects.     For example, a researcher collecting data in October 2010
(for that month and the preceding two months) would conclude that there is no impact of

development aid (▯ = ▯0:9 and p = 0:74). On the other hand, if that same researcher had
conducted her study three months earlier or three months later, she would have concluded

that there is strong evidence in favor of development aid (▯ = ▯8:7, p = 0:02 and ▯ = ▯8:8,
p = 0:07, respectively).


4.2    Application 2: Spatial Clustering and Di▯usion of Conict

Conict is often geographically clustered. One reason might be that geographically prox-

imate units are similar to each other; another is that conict might \spill over" from one
location to the next. Population ows may be one driver for di▯usion by facilitating the

spread of arms, combatants, and ideologies conducive to conict (Kuran, 1998), altering an
area’s ethnic composition (Buhaug, 2008), or exacerbate economic competition (Salehyan

and Gleditsch, 2006; Van Acker, 2005; Claessens et al., 2013; Vlassenroot and Huggins,
2005; Autesserre, 2009, 2010).  44
    While initially limited to research on international conict (Starr and Most (1983),

O’Loughlin (1986)), di▯usion-based explanations have since permeated cross-national stud-
ies of civil war (Braithwaite, 2010; Buhaug, 2008). Disaggregated research on the local dy-

namics of conict, however, is more sparse. One reason for this is the di▯culty of obtaining
high-quality, dynamic data on conict at the micro-level. This is unfortunate because there

is reason to believe that conict di▯usion can operate at a very micro-level. For example,
in Eastern Congo most population movements take place within chiefdoms, with migrants
moving to nearby villages often only several kilometers away. In this second application we

illustrate the usefulness of crowdseeding data to learn about conict di▯usion at this micro-
level. Moreover, we will also illustrate the usefulness of temporal ▯ne grain, by showing

how data collected following a survey-based approach can bias conclusions about conict
di▯usion.

  43Analyzing both sources of variance directly we ▯nd that the variance in estimated e▯ects depends
strongly on the timing of measurement. Starting from month 4, the variance in estimates of the treatment
e▯ect over months 4-24 is 194; the average variance within each period however is just 12. Things settle

down after month 6, but even still the variance in estimates over time (months 7|24) is 12 while the
av44age variance is 11.
    Another channel found to be important is the negative impact of conict on regional economic growth,
which lowers the opportunity costs of rebellion in neighboring areas (Murdoch and Sandler, 2002).




                                              22
    Di▯usion has been an important force in the spread and sustaining of conict in Congo’s

South Kivu province. The First Congo War (1996-7) and the Second Congo War (1998-
2003) were plausibly a direct result of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, with an estimated
                                          45
inux of nearly 1.5 million Rwandans.         Internal migration rates are also high in the
region. A survey conducted in 2007 in over 600 randomly-selected villages throughout

Eastern Congo ▯nds that a full 71% of individuals in South Kivu had ed at least once at
some point during the period 1996-2007 due to armed activities by organized armed groups
           46
or militias.  Table 1 corroborates the presence of forced movements also for our Voix des
Kivus villages (codes 53, 54, 56).

    Does conict di▯use in the South Kivu province?         We investigate the question by
analyzing whether conict in a village in a given period is more likely if conict was higher

in the previous period in neighboring villages. To estimate the magnitude and scope of

such spillover e▯ects we pool our village-period data and model the di▯usion process with
a simple spatial autoregressive model:

                                         X
                           y it▯ + ▯          yj;t▯1+ ▯y i;t▯1+ ▯it                        (1)

                                       j2N(i)
          P
    where          yj;t▯1 is the spatial lag, which can be interpreted as a sum of the number
             j2N(i)                                                              47
of conict events in villages in i’s neighborhood, N(i), in the preceding period.   The term
y     is the lagged dependent variable for village i, and ▯ is an error term|assumed to be
 i;t▯1                                                     it
independent and identically distributed.  48 Note that this equation does not include village
                                                 49
▯xed e▯ects, though these are examined below.
    Equation 1 requires a choice about how a neighbor is de▯ned. Are only villages less

than ten kilometers away neighbors, or are villages 40 kilometers away also neighbors?
This decision can exert a signi▯cant inuence on the magnitude and scope of estimated

di▯usion e▯ects (e.g. Anselin (2002), Zhukov and Stewart (2012)).
    In South Kivu those individuals that migrate due to conict often only move a few kilo-

meters from their village of origin|moving to the nearest safe village or to those villages
with family. In 2012 one of the authors collected information about the migration histories

of 8,199 adults in the Buhavu chiefdom|one of two chiefdoms in South Kivu’s territory of

  45For historical roots, see Prunier (1997) and Prunier (2009).
  46See: f link g. Such conict-induced migration has also been characteristic for the region in more recent

years due to sustained rebel activity and military operations by the government such as the 2009 joint
Congo-Rwanda military o▯ensive Umoja Wetu against the FDLR, followed by Kimia II and Amani Leo.
  47Note that including this summation term means the results are sensitive to the number of villages in
the data set, and thus controlling for temporal ▯xed e▯ects is important. This is not an issue in our analysis

be48w because the number of villages is ▯xed for the period chosen for analysis.
    The interpretation is that there is the own village lag e▯ect and also the \neighbor" lag e▯ect, and we
are looking at the latter conditional on the former.
  49Note that there are biases from estimating ▯xed e▯ects with lagged dependent variables, which disappear

when the number of time periods is large (Nickell, 1981)



                                              23
Kalehe. 50 The data show that 92% of all movements that originated in the Buhavu chief-

dom and were caused by conict|which totaled 4,431 movements|ended in a di▯erent
village, but in the same chiefdom. Conict-induced migration is thus very local in South

Kivu, and we might expect that conict di▯usion is as well. As a result, to test whether
conict di▯usion operates at such a ▯ne-grained level we estimate the spatial autoregres-

sive model multiple times, each time with a di▯erent de▯nition of neighbor. Speci▯cally,
Equation 1 is estimated with a neighbor consecutively de▯ned as those villages inside the

intervals 0 to f6-50g kilometers.
    We also test directly the bene▯t of a crowdseeding system to collect very precise data
on the timing of conict events. To do so we estimate Equation 1 twice: once where we

do not leverage the temporal ▯ne-grain of the data, and once where we do. Speci▯cally,
to learn about conict di▯usion a researcher might conduct a survey twice in our Voix des

Kivus villages collecting in each survey the number of conict events that took place in the
previous period. With both surveys taking place at di▯erent points of time, the conict

events recorded in the ▯rst survey would constitute the baseline levels on the outcome
variable for the subsequent period (y   i;t▯1 in Equation 1).  51 In contrast to such survey-

style data, which collects data for two periods only, a crowdseeded dataset is more ▯ne-
grained with information about the exact timing of events. To leverage this information
                                                                                    52
we undertake the same analysis but using village-week as the unit of analysis.         We now
compare the results based upon these di▯erent datasets.
    The ▯rst two panels in Figure 4 present the results for each type of analysis. The black,

solid line indicates the estimated impact of conict in neighboring villages in the previous
period on a village’s incidence of conict in this period, for a given de▯nition of neighbor;

the gray areas indicate the 95% con▯dence interval. Results are from one-tailed tests (Does
conict spill to the next village?).

    The left panel presents results from estimating Equation 1 based on the \survey-style"
data | that is data without temporal ▯ne grain, clustering the error at the village level.

Two results stand out. First, conict in neighboring villages in the previous period is
associated with fewer conict events in this period. Second, conict di▯usion appears to

operate at the micro level. An additional conict event in a village less than 25 kilometers
away decreases the number of conict events by 0.2; a result that is not only statistically,
but also substantially signi▯cant. As we broaden the de▯nition of neighbor, and thus

include more villages, the estimated magnitudes decreases. Given these results, a researcher
might conclude that migrant spillovers have a positive impact on neighboring villages.

Perhaps in anticipation of responses by peacekeepers or other armed groups, rebel groups

  50This area includes ▯ve of our Voix des Kivus villages: the upper ▯ve villages in Figure 1.
  51Speci▯cally, to simulate this setup in our data we group six months for which we have information from
all villages (November-April, 2011) into two periods each consisting of those conict events that took place
over three months.

    Crowdseeded data can also be analyzed at a more ▯ne-grained level such as by day or|if the data
allows it|hour. We do not do so in this paper.

Figure 4: Conict Di▯usion in South Kivu: By Type of Data Collected. The two left

panels show results from estimating Equation 1 on respectively the survey-based data and
the crowdseeded data, with errors clustered at the village level. The solid black lines

indicate point estimates. Gray areas indicate 95% con▯dence intervals. The right panel

presents results from estimating Equation 1 on crowdseeded data but now also controlling
for village-level ▯xed e▯ects. For all three panels values at the x-axis are the number of

kilometers below which a village is de▯ned as neighbor.


    Results are very di▯erent, however, when the temporal variation provided by crowd-

seeded data is taken into account. The center panel presents results from estimating exactly
the same model but on the more ▯ne-grained data. We now ▯nd evidence for conict dif-

fusion: that is, the point estimates are consistently above the zero line. We again ▯nd that
previous conict in villages nearby have a larger impact than those villages further away.

An additional conict event in a village less than ten kilometers away increases the number
of conict events by 0.05; a result that is not only statistically, but also substantially signif-

icant. The ▯gure illustrates clearly how this impact decreases as we broaden the de▯nition

of neighbor, and quickly becomes non-signi▯cant. The point estimate for villages within
50 kilometers is zero.

    A weakness of both of these analysis is that they fail to distinguish between true
di▯usion and common causes of conict among neighbors. While we assumed ▯                       itto be

independent and identically distributed, variables such as the presence of a rebel group
or a bad harvest might cluster and this might drive our results. Hegre et al. (2001), for

example, ▯nds that the apparent clustering of civil war is fully explained by the clustering

of domestic factors (mainly GDP per capita and regime type). We do not have information



                                                   25
about such factors for our Voix des Kivus villages. However, a major bene▯t of data that
has variation over time is that it allows the researcher to estimate Equation 1 controlling
for village-level ▯xed e▯ects.3 Results from doing so are reported in the right panel of

Figure 4. We ▯nd that our point estimates almost double and that the con▯dence interval
hits the zero bound only at 40 kilometers.

    This application illustrates two points. First, it highlights the importance of getting
the geographic level right. Conict dynamics might operate at the very micro-level ge-
ographically (see also Schutte and Weidmann (2011)). Di▯usion that can be observed

at a very ▯ne resolution may be invisible at a lower resolution. For this, crowdseeding
data shares strengths with datasets such as ACLED that provide ▯ne geographic detail
(a.o. Raleigh et al. (2010), Hegre et al. (2009), Buhaug et al. (2011), Weidmann and

Ward (2010)), though it bene▯ts from a greater density of reported events. Second, the
analysis illustrates the importance of temporal ▯ne grain. It illustrated how conclusions
based on temporally coarse data can produce conclusions diametrically opposed to what is

found with more ▯ne grained data. It is possible that e▯ects work at di▯erent registers|a
more sophisticated model than that provided in Equation 1 might ▯nd for example that

in the short run there is local di▯usion but in the longer run conict moves farther a▯eld.
Assessing such dynamics, however, requires exactly the ▯ne grain illustrated above.


5    Conclusion


The past decade has seen much e▯ort to better understand the causes and consequences
of violent conict. Much of the empirical analysis, however, makes use of data at high

levels of aggregation (often the country and year level). It is therefore not surprising that
in their survey of the civil war literature Blattman and Miguel (2010) argue that \a major
goal of civil war researchers within both economics and political science in the coming

years should be the collection of new data, especially extended panel micro-data sets..."
Original micro-level data is normally collected by conducting surveys or interviews. The
collection of conict data in particular faces a set of challenges because of the nature of

the areas in which conict events take place. These events take place in insecure areas and
are therefore often o▯-limits to researchers; and if data is gathered long after the fact, it

may su▯er from various forms of recall and selection bias.
    In this paper we investigated whether a SMS-based \crowdseeding" system can be used
to obtain high-quality, micro-level panel data on conict. To address the question we

piloted the Voix des Kivus system between 2009 and 2011 in the war-torn South Kivu
province of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Phone holders were pre-selected from
randomly sampled areas, provided cell phones and credit, and invited to provide regular

  5Fixed e▯ects in the presence of a lagged dependent variable runs a risk of bias, especially for short

panels (Arellano and Bond (1991)). An advantage of real time data however is that panels can quickly
become longer than wide.



                                            26
reports to the system. This approach holds out the promise of multiple bene▯ts for data
quality, which includes a claim to representativeness and the possibility to collect conict
event data in real-time. By implementing such a crowdseeding system we hope to overcome

the problems that come with current methods to collect data on conict.
    A ▯rst objective in this research was to probe the feasibility of employing a crowdseeding
approach to gathering high-quality data on conict events in real-time. We found that users

had the capacity and willingness to engage at high levels, the technical implementation
both at the village level and the processing level were smooth, and the costs required were
relatively modest.

    A second goal was to illustrate the use and bene▯ts of crowdseeding data. In a ▯rst
application, we took advantage of exogenous variation resulting from the random imple-
mentation of a development project to assess whether aid is associated with increased or

reduced levels of violence. We implemented Voix des Kivus in such a way that some Voix
des Kivus villages received the development project, and others not. Despite the small
sample, we ▯nd evidence for a negative relationship between aid and conict. In a second

application we exploit the ▯ne grain of the data to examine conict di▯usion patterns. We
▯nd evidence that conict events shift from site to site but ▯nd that that evidence for

di▯usion disappears at a resolution of about 50km. Critically, by exploiting the continuous
nature of our data, both applications highlight the sensitivity of estimates to the timing of
measurement in a way that cannot be assessed from traditional cross-sectional data.

    Ultimately, however, the value of the system depends on the quality of the data that
it generates. Our initial probes, using validation by our agent in the ▯eld, through cross-
reporter comparison of reports, and through comparison with survey data, suggest that the

data is capturing major trends faithfully. However, the data di▯ers both qualitatively and
quantitatively from those from other sources. Comparisons with ACLED data for example
suggest a greater volume of events and a higher attribution of conict events to Congolese

government troops. Moreover, high correlations in the reporting of di▯erent types of events
as well as large variation in the number of events reported by di▯erent areas suggest that
accuracy may be a▯ected by uneven reporter engagement with the system. Given the

promise of the system we believe that there is need now for more formal validation of data
from crowdseeding, perhaps in conjunction with a validation of crowdsourced data, that
would seek to assess rates of Type I and Type II errors relative to data systematically

collected through intensive application of traditional methods.
    We close with reections on the ethical implications of taking a project like this to

scale. During the pilot project we faced no incidents that threatened the safety of the
phone holders. However, things might be di▯erent if a project of this form were scaled up
and attracted the interest of armed groups. For both humanitarian and research purposes

a project such as Voix des Kivus becomes truly useful only when it is taken to scale; but
those are precisely the conditions which might create the greatest risks. We did not assess
these risks because we could not bear them ourselves. But given the importance and utility

of the data these are risks that local and international groups operating in these regions


                                             27
might be prepared to bear.
