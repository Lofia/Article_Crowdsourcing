    Abstract
    Effective and simple screening tools are needed to detect behaviors that are established early in life and have a significant

    influence on weight gain later in life. Crowdsourcing could be a novel and potentially useful tool to assess childhood
    predictors of adult obesity. This exploratory study examined whether crowdsourcing could generate well-documented
    predictors in obesity research and, moreover, whether new directions for future research could be uncovered. Participants

    were recruited through social media to a question-generation website, on which they answered questions and were able to
    pose new questions that they thought could predict obesity. During the two weeks of data collection, 532 participants (62%
    female; age = 26.566.7; BMI = 29.067.0) registered on the website and suggested a total of 56 unique questions. Nineteen
    of these questions correlated with body mass index (BMI) and covered several themes identified by prior research, such as

    parenting styles and healthy lifestyle. More importantly, participants were able to identify potential determinants that were
    related to a lower BMI, but have not been the subject of extensive research, such as parents packing their children’s lunch to
    school or talking to them about nutrition. The findings indicate that crowdsourcing can reproduce already existing

    hypotheses and also generate ideas that are less well documented. The crowdsourced predictors discovered in this study
    emphasize the importance of family interventions to fight obesity. The questions generated by participants also suggest
    new ways to express known predictors.

less, the social and built environment where people grow up in is

largely dependent on their socioeconomic status (SES) and
educational level [22,32]. A lower SES and educational level
during childhood has been consistently found to be related to a

higher BMI later on in life [33,34]. As energy-dense foods are
relatively low in cost, low-income households are more likely to
have low quality diets (e.g., low fruit and vegetables consumption)

[34].
  Furthermore, several studies have examined the effect of
psychosocial factors on the origin of overweight and obesity. For

example, low social acceptability and low psychological well-being
(e.g., negative emotions [33], low self-esteem [35], and depression
[36,37]) have been found to contribute to a higher BMI later on in

life. Finally, although behavioral and environmental factors have      Figure 1. Flow chart of a user’s interaction with the crowdsour-
