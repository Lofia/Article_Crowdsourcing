Abstract: Here we describe the first report of using low-cost cellular or web-based digital cameras to image and quantify standardized
rapid immunoassay strips as a new point-of-care diagnostic and forensics tool with health applications. Quantitative ratiometric pixel
density analysis (QRPDA) is an automated method requiring end-users to utilize inexpensive (∼ $1 USD/each) immunotest strips, a
commonly available web or mobile phone camera or scanner, and internet or cellular service. A model is described whereby a central
computer server and freely available IMAGEJ image analysis software records and analyzes the incoming image data with time-stamp

and geo-tag information and performs the QRPDA using custom JAVA based macros (http://www.neurocloud.org). To demonstrate
QRPDA we developed a standardized method using rapid immunotest strips directed against cocaine and its major metabolite, benzo-
ylecgonine. Images from standardized samples were acquired using several devices, including a mobile phone camera, web cam, and
scanner. We performed image analysis of three brands of commercially available dye-conjugated anti-cocaine/benzoylecgonine (COC/
BE) antibody test strips in response to three different series of cocaine concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 300 ng/ml and BE concentra-

tions ranging from 0.003 to 0.1 ng/ml.This data was then used to create standard curves to allow quantification of COC/BE in biological
samples.Across all devices, QRPDAquantification of COC and BE proved to be a sensitive, economical, and faster alternative to more
costly methods, such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, tandem mass spectrometry, or high pressure liquid chromatography.
The limit of detection was determined to be between 0.1 and 5 ng/ml. To simulate conditions in the field, QRPDA was found to be
robust under a variety of image acquisition and testing conditions that varied temperature, lighting, resolution, magnification and con-

centrations of biological fluid in a sample. To determine the effectiveness of the QRPDA method for quantifying cocaine in biological
samples, mice were injected with a sub-locomotor activating dose of cocaine (5 mg/kg; i.p.) and were found to have detectable levels of
COC/BE in their urine (160.6 ng/ml) and blood plasma (8.1 ng/ml) after 15–30 minutes. By comparison rats self-administering cocaine
in a 4 hour session obtained a final BE blood plasma level of 910 ng/ml with an average of 62.5 infusions. It is concluded that automated
QRPDAis a low-cost, rapid and highly sensitive method for the detectionof COC/BE with health, forensics, and bioinformatics applica-
tion and the potential to be used with other rapid immunotest strips directed at several other targets. Thus, this report serves as a general

reference and method describing the use of image analysis of lateral flow rapid test strips.

Figure 1. Test strip immunoassay system. A) Liquid samples are placed on the test strip sample area, where capillary action draws the fluid along with dye
conjugated antibodies across a test area and control area. If no drugs (blue hexagons) are present, dye will bind at both locations, causing two bands to
appear. B)At intermediate doses, drug-dye binding is incomplete, resulting in a light test band which varies in intensity according to the drug concentration.
A camera and image analysis software can then quantify the relative intensity of the two bands. c) If drugs are present at sufficient concentrations, they
completely bind the drug specific dye and prevent a band from appearing in the test area at all.

Figure 3. Craig medical, medimpex, and Q test standard curves. A) To allow quantification of cocaine and BE in unknown samples, standard curves were

created. First, a series of cocaine standards (0, 3, 5, 10, and 30 ng/ml) were created and applied to test strips obtained from Craig Medical in triplicate.
20 hours after applying the standards to the strip, images of each strip were taken using a Dino-Lite microscope, quantified in ImageJ, and the results
plotted on a curve using IgoR Pro 5.03. B) To determine if the test strips have the same sensitivity towards cocaine and Be, a series of Be standards

(0, 0.003, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.05, and 0.1 ng/ml) were created and applied to Craig Medical test strips in triplicate. Results were obtained and plotted
as in a. Craig Medical Test strips were able to detect Be levels approximately 300 times lower than that of cocaine. c) different brands may have different

sensitivities to CoC/Be. To test this, strips were obtained from Medimpex United, Inc. Four cocaine standards (0, 0.1, 0.5, and 5 ng/ml) were created and
applied to test strips in triplicate. Results were quantified and plotted as in a. Medimpex test strips were approximately 30 times more sensitive to cocaine

than the Craig Medical test strips. D) As in c, except using Q Test strips and seven cocaine standards (0, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 300 ng/ml). Results
indicate that Craig Medical test strips are approximately 3 times more s▯ensitive to cocaine than Q Test strips.

These rates determined how much each infusion (0.5 mg cocaine/kg body weight) increased blood serum levels and how quickly each drug was metabo-
lized. B) Blood CoC levels were simulated by running the model 100 times consecutively. The gray lines represent each individual run of the model, while
the red line highlights one example for clarity. The black line represents the average cocaine level across all 100 modeled sessions. c) Projected Be
