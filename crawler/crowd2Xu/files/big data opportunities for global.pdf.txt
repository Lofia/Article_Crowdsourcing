refinement is limited by human resources.

Moreover, our strong perception of dis-
ease maps as static is clearly flawed
because disease risk can change rapidly
in space and in time and since knowledge

about the distribution of diseases now
improves daily [3–5,22,23], risk maps
become quickly outdated.


Can We Use Big Data

Approaches to Routinely Map
All of These Infectious
Diseases?


  The process described above provides a
continuous risk map in space that is static
in time. Conversely HealthMap (www.
healthmap.org) provides continually up-

dated disease occurrence points but not
continuous spatial data. Can we conceive
of spatially continuous risk maps being

updated in ‘‘real-time’’—as frequently as
new occurrence data are assimilated? The
conceptual bridge of imagining spatial
modelling as a continuous process in time

is achieved simply by linking the output
risk map back to the data inputs to create a
feedback loop. This is important as it

facilitates the novel step of spatial triage of
new occurrence information (see below)
and critically, the potential for multiple
iterations of the map with continuous

improvement by adding a machine learn-
ing element. This conceptual shift towards
evolving maps, in combination with the

increased availability of novel digital data
sources [5,22], is now dissected in the
context of ‘‘Big Data.’’

information assemblages that make con-        Figure 1. A schematic overview of the process of predicting spatial disease risk. The
