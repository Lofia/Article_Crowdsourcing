Abstract
The construction and application of biological network models is an approach           Referee Status:

that offers a holistic way to understand biological processes involved in
disease. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive                                      Invited Referees

and refined the networks during an in-person jamboree meeting. Here, we
describe examples of the changes made to three of these networks: Neutrophil
Signaling, Macrophage Signaling, and Th1-Th2 Signaling. We describe an

innovative approach to biological network construction that combines literature
and data mining and a crowdsourcing approach to generate a comprehensive

set of COPD-relevant models that can be used to help understand the
mechanisms related to lung pathobiology. Registered users of the website can

freely browse and download the networks.

Figure 1. Network construction using a systems biology and crowdsourcing approach. Networks were constructed using published

literature and data sets, and opened to the public for comment and editing in the Network Verification Challenge. The three phases of COPD
network construction are shown. (A and B) Phase 1: COPD augmentation using literature and data. (C and D) Phase 2: Online verification by
the public during an “open phase”, and Phase 3: Face-to-face jamboree meeting where scientists and subject matter experts gathered to

discuss the networks and make final decisions for the next versions.

Figure 4. Improvements in the granularity of two representative network pathways. During Phase 3 of COPD network construction,
improvements were made by adding mechanistic details to over-simplistic edges. A) In the Apoptosis network model, the original connection
(left) simply indicated that XRCC6 decreased the process of apoptosis. The improved pathway connection (right) indicates that XRCC6
decreases the activity of BAX, which normally functions to facilitate the transport of calcium ions through the mitochondrial pores and

thereby increases apoptosis. B) In the Mechanisms of Cellular Senescence network model, the original connection (left) simply indicated
that acrolein increased the process of cellular senescence. The improved pathway connection (right) indicates acrolein mediates its effects
on senescence via the activity of SIRT1 and the FOXO3 transcription factor. Triangle denotes activity, diamond denotes biological process

prediction, module detection, interpretation of molecular profile data, network biomarkers) or detailed

biochemical pathway models (used by most textbooks and pathway databases). While many results are
published in terms of causal networks (e.g. A activates B), one important issue with networks constructed
by collecting these relationships is that they may be difficult to integrate across resources since they are
context specific: A may activate B in the lung, but inhibit B in the heart and when these are integrated, a

conflict arises. Many computational analysis methods require integration of networks from multiple
sources to construct the largest available network and integrate this data with disease-specific molecular
profile data (e.g. gene expression data) to gain context (as it seems is done in the RCR approach). It

would be useful for the authors to further discuss the utility of context-specific causal networks for follow
on discovery.


I only noticed one sentence mentioning use: “By building the network model set in the BEL language
format, we have generated a model framework suitable for biomarker discovery and for the interpretation
of transcriptomic signatures found in human lung tissue.” However, this sentence is not clear and doesn’t

cite any prior literature. How does using the BEL format create models suitable for biomarker discovery?
Can’t molecular interaction or other types of networks also be used for biomarker discovery? What type of
biomarker discovery is referred to here? How are transcriptomic signatures interpreted and analyzed?


Crowdsourcing comments:
“Networks that were not enhanced with COPD-specific mechanisms from the literature or RCR included

the DNA Damage and Notch Signaling networks. Although both these networks relevant to the
development of COPD, they were not augmented beyond the original, non-diseased network scaffolds,
because no studies on the differences in signaling between non-diseased and diseased states were
available.” How do the authors know that no relevant studies were available? It seems that many papers

at least have discussed links between COPD and DNA damage or Notch signaling (e.g. PMID: 19106307
published in 2009 “Down-regulation of the notch pathway in human airway epithelium in association with
smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.”)


“In total, 12 new nodes and 28 new edges were added to the Th1-Th2 Signaling network model during the
jamboree discussions, thereby creating a comprehensive biological network of T-helper cell activity and

their interactions with other immune cells in the context of COPD.” How is ‘comprehensive’ measured?
How do we know how much of the available literature was covered by the crowdsource process? That is,
what is the sensitivity of the crowdsourcing process?


How many contributors were involved in enhancing each network in phase 2? Where were they from e.g.
academia, industry? What incentivized them to contribute – for instance, were they COPD researchers?

For the sake of research into crowdsourcing in biology, it would be very useful to provide additional
analysis of the contributor community. We need to learn more about what works and what doesn’t in
crowdsourcing initiatives so future generations of these approaches can be improved.


The authors state “With nearly 900 new pieces of evidence added by the challenge crowd, a significant
overall enhancement of the networks was achieved in a relatively short time (5 months),” How many
papers (PMIDs) supported the 900 pieces of evidence?


Questions about use of BEL:
Figure 4. The shorthand BEL notation is not widely recognized as a visual format and difficult to read in

general. An easy to read visualization format would make the network figures much easier to understand.
Also, what do the different edge end symbols (e.g. arrow, dot, diamond) mean?



Part C of Figure 1 mentions “BEL to openBEL conversion”. What’s the difference between BEL and

Pathway accessibility and distribution is described but it is not clear as to how these models are available
in any format except web browsing. For the models to be tested by the community, value would come

from making them openly available as downloadable instances in several of the most popular formats.
Feedback on their accuracy could then be encouraged.


I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that
it is of an acceptable scientific standard.


Competing Interests: I was an invitee to one of the Improver conferences to present a talk but did not

contribute to the manuscript or models. I know S. Boue as a previous collaborator and colleague on a
publication "ASTD: The Alternative Splicing and Transcript Diversity database.,” vol. 93, no. 3, pp.

213–220, Mar. 2009."
