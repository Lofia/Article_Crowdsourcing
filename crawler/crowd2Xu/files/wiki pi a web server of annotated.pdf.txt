    Abstract

    Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are the basis of biological functions. Knowledge of the interactions of a protein can help
    understand its molecular function and its association with different biological processes and pathways. Several publicly
    available databases provide comprehensive information about individual proteins, such as their sequence, structure, and

    function. There also exist databases that are built exclusively to provide PPIs by curating them from published literature. The
    information provided in these web resources is protein-centric, and not PPI-centric. The PPIs are typically provided as lists of
    interactions of a given gene with links to interacting partners; they do not present a comprehensive view of the nature of
    both the proteins involved in the interactions. A web database that allows search and retrieval based on biomedical
    characteristics of PPIs is lacking, and is needed. We present Wiki-Pi (read Wiki-p), a web-based interface to a database of

    human PPIs, which allows users to retrieve interactions by their biomedical attributes such as their association to diseases,
    pathways, drugs and biological functions. Each retrieved PPI is shown with annotations of both of the participant proteins
    side-by-side, creating a basis to hypothesize the biological function facilitated by the interaction. Conceptually, it is a search
    engine for PPIs analogous to PubMed for scientific literature. Its usefulness in generating novel scientific hypotheses is

    demonstrated through the study of IGSF21, a little-known gene that was recently identified to be associated with diabetic
    retinopathy. Using Wiki-Pi, we infer that its association to diabetic retinopathy may be mediated through its interactions
    with the genes HSPB1, KRAS, TMSB4X and DGKD, and that it may be involved in cellular response to external stimuli,
    cytoskeletal organization and regulation of molecular activity. The website also provides a wiki-like capability allowing users

    to describe or discuss an interaction. Wiki-Pi is available publicly and freely at http://severus.dbmi.pitt.edu/wiki-pi/.
