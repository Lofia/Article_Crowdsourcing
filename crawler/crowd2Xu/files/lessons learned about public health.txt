 Abstract


 The Internet has forever changed the way people access information and make decisions about their healthcare
 needs. Patients now share information about their health at unprecedented rates on social networking sites such as
 Twitter and Facebook and on medical discussion boards. In addition to explicitly shared information about health

 conditions through posts, patients reveal data on their inner fears and desires about health when searching for
 health-related keywords on search engines. Data are also generated by the use of mobile phone applications that
 track users‚Äô health behaviors (e.g., eating and exercise habits) as well as give medical advice. The data generated

 through these applications are mined and repackaged by surveillance systems developed by academics, companies,
 and governments alike to provide insight to patients and healthcare providers for medical decisions. Until recently,
 most Internet research in public health has been surveillance focused or monitoring health behaviors. Only recently

 have researchers used and interacted with the crowd to ask questions and collect health-related data. In the future,
 we expect to move from this surveillance focus to the ‚Äò‚Äòideal‚Äô‚Äô of Internet-based patient-level interventions where
 healthcare providers help patients change their health behaviors. In this article, we highlight the results of our prior

 research on crowd surveillance and make suggestions for the future.
