  Abstract
  ’Wikification of GIS by the masses’ is a phrase-term first coined by Kamel Boulos in 2005, two years earlier than
  Goodchild’s term ‘Volunteered Geographic Information’. Six years later (2005-2011), OpenStreetMap and Google

  Earth (GE) are now full-fledged, crowdsourced ‘Wikipedias of the Earth’ par excellence, with millions of users
  contributing their own layers to GE, attaching photos, videos, notes and even 3-D (three dimensional) models to
  locations in GE. From using Twitter in participatory sensing and bicycle-mounted sensors in pervasive

  environmental sensing, to creating a 100,000-sensor geo-mashup using Semantic Web technology, to the 3-D
  visualisation of indoor and outdoor surveillance data in real-time and the development of next-generation,
  collaborative natural user interfaces that will power the spatially-enabled public health and emergency situation
  rooms of the future, where sensor data and citizen reports can be triaged and acted upon in real-time by

  distributed teams of professionals, this paper offers a comprehensive state-of-the-art review of the overlapping
  domains of the Sensor Web, citizen sensing and ‘human-in-the-loop sensing’ in the era of the Mobile and Social
  Web, and the roles these domains can play in environmental and public health surveillance and crisis/disaster
  informatics. We provide an in-depth review of the key issues and trends in these areas, the challenges faced when

  reasoning and making decisions with real-time crowdsourced data (such as issues of information overload, “noise”,
  misinformation, bias and trust), the core technologies and Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards involved
  (Sensor Web Enablement and Open GeoSMS), as well as a few outstanding project implementation examples from

  around the world.
