Abstract: Biological networks with a structured syntax are a powerful way of representing biological information generated from

high density data; however, they can become unwieldy to manage as their size and complexity increase. This article presents a crowd-
verification approach for the visualization and expansion of biological networks.
Web-based graphical interfaces allow visualization of causal and correlative biological relationships represented using Biological

Expression Language (BEL). Crowdsourcing principles enable participants to communally annotate these relationships based on lit-
erature evidences. Gamification principles are incorporated to further engage domain experts throughout biology to gather robust peer-

reviewed information from which relationships can be identified and verified.
The resulting network models will represent the current status of biological knowledge within the defined boundaries, here processes
related to human lung disease.These models are amenable to computational analysis. For some period following conclusion of the chal-

lenge, the published models will remain available for continuous use and expansion by the scientific community.

Figure 1. Outline of the crowd-verification verification process that will be used in the Network Verification Challenge (NVC).
The NvC consists of five phases. In the first phase, network models are constructed based on the literature and data-driven hypothesis validation. The
models are imported into a Web-based platform (CausalBioNet) for the second phase (online Crowd-verification). In phase 2, experts and biology students
and researchers are encouraged to access and verify/enhance the network models directly on the platform. This process is set up as a reputation-based
collaborative competition, where actions on the network are given points that are recorded in a leaderboard. After this online phase is closed, in phase 3,

the results and actions are analyzed, and the organizers select a number of edges that appeared to be the most controversial for discussion in a jamboree
(phase 4) that will gather together scientific experts and the best contributors in the online phase. After a wrap up of the conclusions and actions on the
network discussed during the jamboree, in phase 5, verified versions of the networks will be released for the scientific community at large to use.

The networks provided in the NvC are potentially at the center of very diverse applications. They provide the ability to extract mechanistic insights from
large datasets in toxicity or pharmacological testing. The networks will also provide teachers and students with a centralized repository of lung-related
biology-relevant genes and pathways. Their usefulness in patient stratification, personalized medicine, and other areas of research is accomplished
through a functional layer of available tools for visualization, refinement, and diverse types of quantitative and qualitative analyses.

example p(hgNC:CCND1) =. kin(p(hgNC:CDK4) is a statement equivalent to “Increased abundance of the protein designated by ‘CCND1’ in the hgNC

response to cell stress (green), immune response (yellow), and tissue response (orange). The separation is biologically not always as clear, so the shape
of the nodes also reflects common areas. For example, the immune regulation of tissue repair is both an immune and a tissue response.

Figure 9. Outline of the crowd-verification process showing the actions available in the NVC online phase and verification outcomes.
(A) Actions that will be available for verification of the networks. The “starting” network is shown as pink nodes and black edges. Each edge is supported
by a number of evidences or BeL statements. The weight close to the edge shows the number of evidences available for each edge (ie, the weight of
the evidences for that edge). participants can vote for (approve/reject) evidences. If the evidence is for a new edge, that edge will then be added to the
network. (B) Examples of possible verification outcomes. A limited number of votes will be allowed on each evidence after which the evidence will be
and locked from further voting. Conversely, if the majority finds the evidence inappropriate, then it can be rejected. In cases where no clear consensus
emerges, the evidence will be locked and considered for discussion in the jamboree. Evidences that do not accumulate a sufficient number of votes will
be considered as not verified.

Figure 10. Numbers of publications that mention the word “jamboree”.
The merriam-Webster definitions of “jamboree” are “a large festive gathering” or “a national or international camping assembly of boy Scouts”. The con-
cept of “jamboree” meetings in the context of science has emerged only recently. One of its first appearances in the scientific literature was in a report
about the outcome of a scientific jamboree for undergraduate students. The jamboree was held to conclude their summer work of trying to construct small
biological devices. The jamboree allowed students to share data, experiences, and most importantly to realize how their contribution had been valuable.
It also showed that coordinated efforts can lead to better results than the sum of individual efforts. Similarly, endeavors such as network reconstruction or
genome annotation projects, which entail countless efforts that are best distributed among many teams, also benefit from jamboree sessions where results
can be homogenized and validated. The reconstruction of a consensus yeast metabolic network project set the ground for the type of scientific ventures
that benefit greatly from jamboree meetings. The goals set for the yeast jamboree meeting were threefold: (i) define the standards that should be used,

(ii) annotate, and (iii) re4olve discrepancies. What a reconstruction annotation jamboree entails and how it should be organized was later summarized very
nicely by Thiele5and palsson. Jamborees have also been used in other 1rojects, namely a community-based effort to construct a model of Salm40ella
typhimurium LT2, and the reconstruction of the human metabolic network. Another successful jamboree was held for the Little Skate genome project.
The goal of these jamboree sessions was not only to provide a floor for discussion, but also to deliver training in various fields related to genome annota-
tion and analysis, and to coordinate the efforts.
