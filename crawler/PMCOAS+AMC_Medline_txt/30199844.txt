Association of exercise with smoking-related symptomatology, smoking behavior and impulsivity in men and women
Introduction:
Despite extensive efforts to develop effective smoking cessation interventions, 70–85% of American cigarette smokers who quit relapse within one year. Exercise has shown promise as an intervention; however, many results have been equivocal. This study explored how exercise is associated with smoking-related symptomatology, smoking behavior and impulsivity in male and female smokers.
Methods:
Participants were recruited throughout the United States using the on-line crowdsourcing platform, Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. They completed a survey with self-report measures assessing exercise, smoking-related symptomatology, smoking behavior and impulsivity. Differences between men and women were tested using t- and chi-square tests. Regression analyses tested for associations between exercise and smoking-related symptomatology, smoking behavior and impulsivity.
Results:
Participants (N = 604) were, on average, 32 (SD = 6.2) years old, mostly Caucasian, with at least some college education and approximately half were women. Women exercised slightly less than men and had more negative affect, craving, physical symptoms and withdrawal. Women smoked more cigarettes per day, had greater nicotine dependency and more years of smoking. Positive affect was positively associated with exercise for both men and women; however, this association was significantly stronger in women. Negative affect and withdrawal were inversely associated with exercise for women only. Impulsivity was inversely associated with exercise for both men and women.
Conclusion:
Exercise was significantly associated with several smoking-related symptomatology, smoking behavior and impulsivity variables for both men and women, suggesting that exercise may be a useful intervention for smoking cessation. Future prospective research should determine how exercise directly impacts smoking cessation.
Introduction
Cigarette smoking remains the single largest preventable cause of death and disease in the United States. In 2015, an estimated 15.1% (36.5 million) of U.S. adults were current cigarette smokers. The public health implications of this are substantial. Smoking-related illness in the United States costs more than $300 billion a year, including nearly $170 billion in direct medical care for adults and $156 billion in lost productivity. Although extensive research has been conducted on effective smoking cessation interventions [i.e., computer/electronic aids, behavioral interventions and pharmacotherapy ], nearly 70–85% of Americans still relapse within one year after quitting smoking. Effective, long-term treatment approaches are severely lacking.
Some research has shown that men and women differ in their ability to quit smoking while others dispute this gender disparity. One study found that women smoke fewer cigarettes per day, they smoke cigarettes with lower nicotine content and do not inhale as deeply as men. However, other studies have found that women tend to have greater nicotine dependency, have higher rates of relapse, they are less likely to achieve long-term abstinence and have greater difficulty quitting than men. These seemingly contradictory findings may be attributable to differences in methodology (i.e., how abstinence is defined or whether the study accounted for the use of other types of nicotine), as well as in the generalizability of samples used in clinical settings to the general population of smokers. Therefore, continued study of these factors in more representative samples may help inform future treatment approaches for both men and women.
Physical activity (i.e., exercise) has been studied over the past several years as a potential treatment for drug abuse, as well as for smoking cessation; however, the results have been equivocal. Methodological limitations (e.g., small sample sizes and poor adherence to exercise programs) and variations in implementation of exercise into smoking cessation programs (e.g., timing, duration and intensity) have prevented definitive conclusions about its efficacy. In an extensive review by, it was reported that only one of 13 trials offered significant reduction in smoking at the 12-month follow-up. The other trials were either too small to reliably detect an effect or included an exercise intervention which was not intense enough to achieve the desired level of physical effort. However, a more recent meta-analysis by, investigating exercise for substance use disorders, indicated that a moderate to high-intensity aerobic exercise program may be an effective and persistent treatment for those with substance use disorders, including tobacco use disorder. In a recent review, also reported promising evidence for exercise as a treatment for substance abuse. They reported that the preclinical literature consistently showed that physical activity may serve as both a preventive and treatment intervention that reduces drug use, although alcohol use appeared to be an exception. The clinical literature has provided some evidence, although mixed, to suggest a beneficial effect of physical activity specifically on tobacco dependent individuals.
Withdrawal symptoms, craving and negative affect are all known risk factors for relapse. Some research has shown that exercise may attenuate these symptoms, further validating its effectiveness for smoking cessation. In a systematic review by, 12 of 15 studies showed a favorable effect of exercise on acute cigarette craving with immediate results lasting up to 30 min. It was also reported that four of the five studies that examined the impact of exercise on affect found a positive influence of exercise on various measures of affect. Smoking withdrawal symptoms included irritability, tension, restlessness and difficulty concentrating. Three out of the five studies that assessed this construct using the Mood and Physical Symptoms Scale reported a positive effect of exercise on at least one withdrawal symptom.
Another key factor related to smoking cessation and relapse is impulsivity (a multidimensional trait comprised of attentional, motor and non-planning factors), which has been discussed and reviewed in recent studies. Recent studies have shown that the non-planning facet is specifically associated with poorer response to smoking cessation treatments and impulsivity/disinhibition may predict successful smoking cessation through treatment. However, much less is known about how exercise may influence impulsivity and in turn, effect smoking cessation and relapse. One preclinical study by found that in rats, physical activity decreased sensitivity to reinforcement amount and sensitivity to reinforcement delay, two behavioral processes that contribute to delay discounting (i.e., a decline in the present value of a reward with delay to its receipt). A second clinical study by found limited support showing that exercise reduced delay discounting in humans. Further research is needed in this area.
The main goal of the present study was to examine the association of physical activity (i.e., exercise) with smoking-related symptomatology (e.g., withdrawal, craving, physical symptoms and positive/negative affect), smoking behavior and impulsivity in a large cross-sectional sample of participants who smoke; while also considering mean differences between men and women.
Methods
Study design
Participants were recruited for this study through the on-line crowdsourcing platform, Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (mTURK; www.mturk.com). The mTURK platform is a convenient, reliable and cost-effective tool for collecting survey data. All participants for this study were required to have a 95% or higher approval rating from investigators on previously submitted mTURK tasks, over 100 approved prior mTURK tasks and current residence within the United States. Respondents were asked to read an informed consent document describing the study procedures, compensation and anonymity terms. All participants indicated that they understood this document and agreed to participate via electronic confirmation. The University of Minnesota IRB approved all procedures.
Participants were asked to complete the survey in one sitting and were informed that it would take approximately 1–15 minutes based on their eligibility. Eligible participants were required to smoke cigarettes on a daily basis and be between 18–45 years of age. Forty-five years of age was chosen as a cutoff as a section of this survey (to be presented elsewhere) focused on the menstrual cycle and, therefore, it was imperative to restrict the sample to women who were more likely to be premenopausal and have regular menstrual cycles. In an effort to keep groups comparable, we opted to restrict the male age as well. Recruitment was initially restricted to those living in the upper Midwest; however, after encountering slower than expected accrual, the survey was opened to all respondents residing in the United States. If the participant failed to qualify, he or she was provided $0.05 compensation for completing the screening portion of the study. Participants who qualified and completed any portion of the main survey were compensated $1.05.
Study measures
Data for this analysis came from a battery of self-report measures assessing physical activity and exercise, smoking-related symptomatology, smoking behavior and impulsivity. Study data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at the University of Minnesota. To ensure that participants remained engaged in the study tasks, attention checks were performed periodically throughout the study. Eighty-seven percent (n = 604) of participants passed all five checks and were included in the analysis. The remaining 13% (n = 88) were removed prior to data analysis (all participants removed were demographically similar to those included in the analysis).
Physical activity
Baecke’s Questionnaire for Habitual Physical Activity is a 16-item measure assessing three dimensions: (1) occupational physical activity, (2) physical exercises in leisure and (3) leisure and locomotion activities. In this study, we focused on dimension three, the leisure and locomotion activities scale (LLA; higher scores indicate more physical activity) as well as two questions from dimension two: item 2, “Compared to others of my age, I think my physical activity during leisure hours is…” (labeled below as sport/exercise compared to others; response options: much less, less, the same, more, much more) and item 4, “During leisure hours, I practice sport or physical exercises” (labeled below as sport/exercise frequency; response options: never, seldom, sometimes, often, very often).
Smoking-related symptomatology.
The Subjective State Scale is a 24-item measure used to assess five subscales regarding smoking-related symptomatology; each item in each subscale uses a seven-point Likert-type scale. (1) Positive affect was defined as an average of the Likert responses to feeling cheerful, content, calm, in control and interested. (2) Negative affect was defined as an average of feeling anxious, irritable, impatient and restless. (3) Craving was defined as a desire to smoke. (4) Physical symptoms were defined as an average of feeling a headache, tremor, cough, stomach problems, sweating, tiredness and drowsiness. (5) Withdrawal was defined as an average of feeling irritable, angry, anxious, having difficulty concentrating, restlessness, sadness and hunger.
Smoking behavior
Several items were included regarding smoking behavior. They were: (1) cigarettes per day, (2) years of smoking, (3) motivation to quit (10 point Likert-type scale with 10 indicating higher motivation), and (4) nicotine dependency, evaluated by time to first morning cigarette.
Impulsivity
The Barrett Impulsiveness Scale (BIS) is a 30-item measure of the personality/behavioral construct of impulsiveness. This scale yields six first-order factors and three second-order factors. This study focused on the total score and three second-order factors: attentional, motor and non-planning.
Statistical analysis
Means and standard deviations were calculated and two-sample t-tests were used to compare continuous variables across sexes. Counts and frequencies were reported and chi-square tests were used to compare categorical variables across sexes. To estimate the associations of exercise with smoking-related symptomatology, smoking behavior and impulsivity, each of these sub-scales or factors was used as a response variable in a regression model. LLA score, sex, and their interaction were the predictors of interest, adjusting for demographic covariates. Sport/exercise frequency was analyzed in a similar way, assuming a continuous linear scale across the five categories. Multiple linear regression was used for smoking-related symptomatology and impulsivity. Negative binomial regression was used for smoking frequency and years of smoking, while equal slopes adjacent categories logit regression was used for time to first morning cigarette. Regressions adjusted for participant characteristics (those shown in Table 1). All statistical analyses were conducted with SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
Overall, participants (N = 604) were on average 32 (SD = 6.2) years of age, mostly Caucasian (85%), with at least some college education (48%). They were evenly divided by sex (55.6% female, 45.3% male) and about half were never married (52.3%). All four census regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, West) were represented with the largest proportion of participants residing in the south (41.1%). Average BMI for all participants was in the overweight range (M = 27.9, SD = 7.1).
Age (p = 0.019), BMI (p = 0.005), marital status (p < 0.001), race (p = 0.009), and education (p < 0.001) were significantly different between men and women; however, these differences were small in magnitude (see Table 1). Women were slightly older, had a slightly higher BMI, were more likely to be married, included a higher proportion of Asians and a lower proportion of Black/African Americans, and included a higher proportion of high school and college graduates.
Physical activity
Total LLA scores (physical activity) showed a small but statistically significant difference between men and women (see Table 2 and Fig. 1). Women reported a mean LLA score of 2.23 (SD = 0.67) while men reported a mean score of 2.39 (SD = 0.68; p = 0.029). When asked about their physical activity compared to others of the same age (sport/exercise compared to others), 61.8% (n = 204) of women reported their physical activity as “less or much less” compared to 45.6% (n = 125) of men (p < 0.001). When asked about practicing sport or physical exercise (sport/exercise frequency), 53.6% (n=177) of women reported “never or seldom” compared to 42.7% (n=117) of men (p = 0.056).
Smoking-related symptomatology
Smoking-related symptomatology significantly differed in all five subscales between men and women (see Table 2 and Fig. 2) and although these differences were small in magnitude, they were consistent across all five subscales. Women reported slightly less positive affect (4.16 ± 1.66 vs. 4.44 ± 1.49, p = 0.029) and more negative affect (2.63 ± 1.73 vs. 2.19 ± 1.66, p = 0.002), more craving (5.20 ± 1.67 vs. 4.81 ± 1.77, p = 0.006), more physical symptoms (1.85 ± 1.34 vs. 1.48 ± 1.20, p < 0.001) and more withdrawal (2.38 ± 1.54 vs. 2.08 ± 1.41, p = 0.014) than men.
Smoking behavior
Smoking behavior also significantly differed between men and women and these differences were a bit larger in magnitude (see Table 2 and Fig. 2). Women smoked on average almost two more cigarettes per day (13.92 ± 8.44 vs. 11.95 ± 7.76, p = 0.003) and had on average 1.4 more years of smoking (13.73 ± 6.94 vs. 12.32 ± 6.48, p = 0.011). Time to first morning cigarette significantly differed with 35.2% (n=115) of women reporting smoking their first cigarette within 5 min of waking compared to 23.9% (n=65) of men (p = 0.027). In contrast, motivation to quit did not significantly differ between men and women (p = 0.466).
Impulsivity
BIS total score did not significantly differ between men and women (p = 0.394; see Table 2 and Fig. 2). However, the second-order factor, attentional impulsivity, did significantly differ with women reporting slightly higher scores (16.4 ± 4.69 vs. 15.08 ± 4.10, p = 0.008). No differences were found between the other two second-order factors: motor and non-planning.
Associations of exercise with smoking-related symptomatology, impulsivity and smoking behavior
Exercise with smoking-related symptomatology.
Associations of exercise with smoking-related symptomatology are shown in Table 3a. For women, LLA score was positively associated with positive affect (0.502 ± 0.134, p < 0.001) and inversely associated with negative affect (−0.284 ± 0.143, p = 0.047). For men, LLA score was positively associated with positive affect only (0.383 ± 0.142, p = 0.007). There were no sex differences in these associations (p = 0.538). Furthermore, for women, sport/exercise frequency was positively associated with positive affect (0.383 ± 0.142, p = 0.007), while there was no such association for men (p = 0.730). However, that strong positive association for women was significantly different from the null association for men (p < 0.001). For women, sport/exercise frequency was also inversely associated with negative affect (−0.303 ± 0.094, p = 0.001) and withdrawal (−0.220 ± 0.083, p = 0.008), while no such associations were found for men.
Exercise with impulsivity
Associations of exercise with impulsivity are shown in Table 3b. For women, LLA score was inversely associated with BIS-attentional (−.730 ± 0.363, p = 0.045) and BIS non-planning (−1.078 ± 0.469, p = 0.002). For men, LLA score was inversely associated with BIS attentional (−0.819 ± 0.384, p = 0.033), BIS non-planning (−1.840 ± 0.497, p < 0.001) and BIS total (−2.674 ± 1.111, p = 0.016). There were no sex differences in these associations. Furthermore, for women, sport/exercise frequency was inversely associated with BIS attentional (−0.653 ± 0.240, p = 0.006), BIS non-planning (−1.061 ± 0.313, p < 0.001) and BIS total (−1.843 ± 0.696, p = 0.008). For men, no such associations of exercise frequency were found, and there were no sex differences in these associations.
Exercise with smoking behavior
Associations of exercise with smoking behavior are shown in Table 3c. For cigarettes per day, years of smoking and time to first morning cigarette, no significant associations were found for either men or women for LLA score or for sport/exercise frequency. However, for time to first morning cigarette, the female odds ratio associated with sport/exercise frequency was significantly different from the male odds ratio associated with sport/exercise frequency (p = 0.043). For example, for women, the odds ratio for smoking within 5 min, relative to smoking within 6–30 minutes, was less than 1 (0.933) for a 1-unit higher sport/exercise frequency, indicating more frequent exercise was associated with first cigarette being later in the morning. For men, this odds ratio was greater than 1 (1.027), indicating more frequent exercise was associated with first cigarette being earlier in the morning. However, the magnitude of these effects as well as the magnitude of the sex difference suggests minimal clinical relevance.
Discussion
While the main purpose of this study was to examine the association of physical activity (i.e., exercise) with smoking-related symptomatology (e.g., withdrawal, craving, physical symptoms and positive/negative affect), smoking behavior and impulsivity, we also considered mean differences between men and women as well. We found that women in this study reported slightly less exercise than men, which is consistent with prior literature and 62% of women compared to 46% of men felt as though they exercised less compared to others of the same age. We also found that smoking-related symptomatology significantly differed between men and women. Although these differences were small in magnitude and should be regarded with caution, they were consistent across all five subscales. Women reported less positive affect and more negative affect, craving, physical symptoms and withdrawal than men. Further, we found that women showed significantly greater nicotine dependence than men: 35% of women compared to 24% of men reported smoking their first morning cigarette within five minutes of waking. Women also smoked significantly more cigarettes per day and had more years of smoking.
In contrast, impulsivity did not vary greatly between men and women. Only inattentiveness and cognitive instability were significantly different between sexes with women showing slightly higher impulsivity. Prior literature on sex differences in impulsivity vary depending on the construct assessed and the specific test used. For instance, in continuous performance and go/no-go tasks, when impulsive action is measured as absolute number of inhibitory failures, men showed greater impulsivity. By contrast, on stop signal tasks, when stimulus presentation is adjusted to maintain a 50% inhibition rate, women required more time to inhibit a prepotent response. In our study we used a self-report measure. Since the current knowledge regarding sex differences in impulsivity varies across many tasks, more research is needed regarding the degree to which men and women differ in impulsivity. This may allow for more specific prevention and treatment interventions.
Understanding the associations between exercise, smoking-related symptomatology, smoking behavior and impulsivity was of particular interest in this study. We found that positive affect for both men and women was significantly associated with exercise. In other words, the more positive affect a person experiences, the more exercise he or she self-reports. Conversely, we found the opposite for negative affect and withdrawal in women, but not in men. Additional novel findings were observed in the relationships between impulsivity and exercise. First, we found that inattentiveness and cognitive instability were inversely associated with exercise for both men and women. We also found that lack of self-control and cognitive complexity were inversely associated with exercise for both men and women. We know from previous literature that impulsivity is strongly associated with smoking; however, the present study is among the first to describe the inverse association between impulsivity and exercise among smokers. These findings suggest that addressing smoking-related symptomatology and impulsivity may be beneficial in increasing exercise among smokers in a smoking cessation treatment intervention.
This study included noteworthy and innovative contributions. It is among the first to utilize Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (mTURK) to evaluate the association of exercise with smoking-related symptomatology, smoking behavior and impulsivity. mTURK has been in existence for over a decade; however, only over the past several years have academic researchers begun to use it as a tool for data collection in the field of addiction research. One of the most valued aspects of this technology was the speed and cost effectiveness of collecting high quality data. We were able to collect data from over 600 participants across the US in just a few weeks’ time while keeping expenses well below typical costs usually required for other methods (e.g., Facebook, mailing, in-person data collection). The use of online samples can also increase the external validity of research studies by providing more geographically and demographically diverse samples than traditional research. These features combined with the rising rates on internet accessibility in clinical and non-clinical populations supports the use of crowdsourcing techniques for research purposes.
Although this study is strengthened by a large sample size and strict data quality criteria, it’s limitations are worth noting. First, smoking status could not be biologically verified. It is possible that non-smokers took part in the study and did not answer questions truthfully. However, the consistency between smoking behavior and smoking-related symptomatology reported in our study with that of the published literature suggests that our respondents were truly smokers. Second, these data were self-reported and cross sectional. Self-reported data are subject to error due to social desirability bias (the tendency of survey respondents to answer questions in a manner that will be viewed favorably by others). Longitudinal studies are necessary to examine if the observed associations are pre-existing or a consequence of exercise. Third, although 64% of participants indicated they were employed full-time, it is unknown if these participants work from home. This may bias our sample, as stay at home workers may be less likely to commute or even leave the home on a regular basis, thus, contributing to a more sedentary lifestyle. Finally, the nonprobability sampling approach and low inclusion of minority respondents may limit the generalizability of our findings. However, comparisons across different convenience sampling methods suggests that mTURK samples may actually be more representative than college samples or those drawn from college towns. Problematic responding (e.g., responding in socially acceptable ways) also does not systematically differ between mTURK, college, and community sources.
In conclusion, this study is among the first to utilize Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (mTURK) to examine the association of physical activity (i.e., exercise) with smoking-related symptomatology (e.g., withdrawal, craving, physical symptoms and positive/negative affect), smoking behavior and impulsivity in a large, cross-sectional sample of participants who smoke; while also considering mean differences between men and women. Results indicated that exercise was significantly associated with several of these variables and, therefore, may be a useful intervention for smoking cessation. Future prospective research should utilize fitness trackers such as ActiGraphs or Fitbits in order to objectively measure both intensity of exercise and physical movement. Employing a randomized controlled trial would be best to determine how exercise directly impacts smoking cessation for men and women.
