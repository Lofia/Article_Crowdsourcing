Demographic Stability on Mechanical Turk Despite COVID-19
Behavioral scientists often think in abstract terms about the people who participate in research. University students form a ‘subject pool’. People recruited outside the university are a ‘community sample’. And, people who complete studies online are part of an ‘online panel’ or a ‘crowdsourcing platform’. This language obscures something important: participants in human subjects research are people, shaped by their unique experiences and shared cultural events. Since early 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been one of these events.
How might research participants change in response to COVID-19? One possibility raised by Lourenco and Tasimi is that online participants may become less diverse. Because tens of millions of people have recently become unemployed, it is reasonable to wonder whether people who are struggling to pay the bills will be able to maintain an internet connection–let alone find the time and energy to participate in research. If people are forced to choose between essential things like food and nonessential things like the internet, the diversity of people in online platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) may decrease, leaving researchers with a narrower group from which to sample. As Lourenco and Tasimi note, decreasing diversity should concern all researchers at a time when more research is moving online, because less diversity may affect the replicability of studies.

Numbers are percentages of unique participants within each month from the CloudResearch database. A description of this database and how well it captures the Mechanical Turk population appears in Robinson et al. and Moss et al..

Fortunately, on MTurk, we do not see evidence of this so far. Demographic data showing who used MTurk before COVID-19 compares favorably with data from today. Table 1 shows the race, income, and gender of people on MTurk from January 2019 through mid-May 2020. The data–which are from CloudResearch’s Metrics tool and are publicly available at https://metrics.cloudresearch.com/–are largely consistent. Despite small changes here and there, the race, income, and gender of people on MTurk have remained remarkably constant.
Of course, demographic consistency thus far is no guarantee changes will not occur. For a few reasons, however, we are cautiously optimistic about the stability of participant demographics on platforms like MTurk. First, most people who use MTurk do so from home. According to one survey, less than 2% of people connect to MTurk in public spaces (https://www.cloudresearch.com/resources/blog/trends-of-mturk-workers/), meaning an inability to access the internet in places like a coffee shop or library is unlikely to change who is on MTurk.
Next, while a staggering number of people are currently unemployed, people who lost their job and previously used MTurk differ from those who lost their job and do not use MTurk in at least one important way: users of MTurk have access to an online platform that enables them to earn money from home. Although MTurk was not intended as a source of full-time employment, it provides an opportunity for people to supplement their income. This opportunity may be all the more important to people who have recently become unemployed and may rely on MTurk to temporarily make ends meet or pay for relatively small bills like an internet connection, something most people agree is currently important.
Finally, we are optimistic about the demographic consistency of people on platforms like MTurk because, ultimately, what matters more than a change in the overall demographics of participants, which have historically been stable, is the demographic composition of participants within samples. Although within sample variability is overlooked by many researchers, the composition of participants within samples can vary substantially. For example, while platform level data on MTurk indicate a near even gender split, the percentage of men can vary from 25% to as high as 75% across samples. Similar variation occurs for other demographics. If participant demographics are important for generalizability and estimating the strength of effect sizes, then this issue deserves more attention. Fortunately, because online platforms are bigger, more diverse, and easier to manage than many traditional sources of participant recruitment, researchers can control the demographics of participants within studies using quotas. Most participant recruitment platforms make setting such quotas easy.
To close, even though we are relatively sanguine about the prospect of demographic consistency within online research platforms, we would like to echo a point made by Lourenco and Tasimi about the new normal of conducting behavioral research. COVID-19 has changed how social scientists approach their work. As the pandemic progresses, more changes may follow. To conduct rigorous research, behavioral scientists need to be creative. Finding ways to reach people where they are, to push for a close of the digital divide, and to connect with people who are not currently part of online research platforms will strengthen the quality of behavioral research.
