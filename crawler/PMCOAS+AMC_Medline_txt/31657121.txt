Crowdsourced analysis of factors and misconceptions associated with parental willingness to donate their child’s organs
We evaluated factors associated with a parental willingness to donate their child’s organs. A twenty-one-question survey was administered to US parents with at least one child to measure organ donation acceptability and brain death beliefs using an online crowdsourcing medium, Amazon’s Mechanical Turk Prime. We collected 425 surveys; 76% were willing to donate their own and 65% willing to donate their child’s organs. Parents who agreed brain death was synonymous with death (47%) were 2.37 times more willing to donate. Compared with White respondents, Black (OR 5.27, CI 2.81, 9.88) and Hispanic (OR 2.24, CI 1.06–4.75) participants were more likely to believe doctors “steal organs from patients” and “declare someone dead based on their skin color” (OR 4.97, CI 2.65–9.32; OR 2.19, CI 1.01–4.72, respectively). Lower income participants were also more likely to believe doctors “steal organs from patients,” OR 0.81 (95% CI 0.68–0.96 for increasing income) and “declare someone dead based on how much money they have,” OR 0.80 (95% CI 0.67–0.96 for increasing income). Confusion surrounding brain death and skepticism (particularly among racial and ethnic minorities and lower socioeconomic groups) toward doctors’ motivations for donation contribute to lack of parental willingness to donate.
INTRODUCTION
Organ donation can be a life-saving intervention for a child or adult with an otherwise life-limiting illness, with nearly 120 000 individuals (2000 under age 18) currently on the organ donation waitlist. Public opinion is generally favorable toward organ donation, with 95% of US adults supporting the concept of organ donation. When we evaluate actual organ donation rates, this number decreases to 69.6% (down from 72.3% in 2016) for US adults and 69.2% for donation of pediatric organs. Historically, racial and ethnic minority populations have had a lower rate of organ donation than non-minority populations. Despite improvement in adult consent rates in recent years due to educational programs, a lack of understanding of the organ donation process exists, and the consent rate for racial and ethnic minority populations remains lower than White adults (77%) with rates of 55% among Black adults, 68% among Hispanics, and 48% among Asians. Black adults report a lack of trust in the organ donation system and in the declaration of death by physicians. A retrospective study performed in Canada revealed decreased rates of parental consent for pediatric organ donation among racial and ethnic minorities; however, differences of parental consent rates among racial and ethnic minorities in the United States are not yet known.
Death by neurologic criteria, subsequently referred to as brain death, is the most common source of organ donation in pediatrics, comprising over 70% of deceased donors. Brain death, a legally accepted definition of death, can be a challenging and emotional concept not only for families but also for many members of the healthcare team to comprehend. Healthcare teams often make intentional efforts to separate declaration of brain death and organ donation, often using separate teams. Despite these efforts, brain death and organ donation are often linked in the minds of patients and the medical community and the literature has even shown decreased willingness to donate when brain death is not well understood.
The emotional complexity of brain death and pediatric organ donation, coupled with the relatively rare occurrence of pediatric brain death, creates challenges to obtaining parental perceptions using conventional methods of data collection. The critical care setting adds a unique research challenge given parental anxiety and perceived additional strain on their child, resulting in inadequate consent rates for in-person survey participation. In general, today’s research participants are much less likely to answer phone surveys, paper surveys, or in-person surveys and desire an accessible platform to voice their opinions. Less than 50% of homes own a landline telephone, which makes traditional phone surveys at an increasing risk of bias. Declining response rates and an inability to obtain quality participants via traditional survey methods creates challenges to obtaining population-based data; thus, it is imperative for the medical field to find alternative methods to reach the public. Knowing that 80% of Internet users conduct health-related searches, the Internet seems to be an ideal platform for surveying public opinion, especially regarding sensitive topics.
Crowdsourcing is a promising internet-based mechanism as it provides access to a large database of participants in a convenient, economical, and efficient manner. The use of crowdsourcing platforms, such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) Prime, provides researchers access to difficult to reach populations and allows participants to answer questions that have the potential to benefit society at large more significantly than smaller cohort studies given the generalizability. Individuals who participate in these crowdsourcing platforms are primarily intrinsically motivated through altruism and have a desire to contribute to society. As a field, it is important to transition our research methods as technology advances and to utilize approaches that allow more members of society a platform to let their voices be heard. In this study, we aimed to explore parental willingness to donate their child’s organs and identify factors influencing a parent’s willingness to donate using an innovative crowdsourcing platform.
PATIENTS AND MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
We conducted a cross-sectional study using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) Prime platform to explore parental willingness to donate their own and their child’s organs using an online survey. Mturk is a crowdsourcing medium designed to match its 20 million diverse participants worldwide with researchers. MTurk Prime, a division of MTurk, provides a more representative population of survey participants for a higher fee for service than MTurk, as well as the ability to limit survey administration to specific populations. Mturk prime panels have >600 000 US workers.
MTurk has been used widely by academics, with over 15 000 papers, many in top-ranked scientific journals, containing the phrase “Mechanical Turk.” When comparing data from MTurk to various other methodologies including gold standard, expert opinion, and other sampling methods, Mortensen et al found the Mturk medium to be both reliable and economical. Given the validity of MTurk in various forms of research and the accessibility of a large sample size, it is an emerging medium to explore the public’s viewpoint.
The study was described on Mturk Prime’s website with the wording of “Answer a survey about your opinions regarding organ donation.” The survey keywords included “organ donation, parents.” There was an allotted time slot of 1 hour, and the survey task expired in 7 days for the participant. We created a Mturk Prime panel to identify individuals located in the United States with at least one child less than 18 years of age. Only individuals that met those above qualifications were able to see the study description. Qualifying survey participants were invited to contribute and directed to a REDCap survey link. Once on the REDCap page the study read “This survey is part of a research study. It is designed to explore the public perception of adult and pediatric organ donation and explore how understanding of brain death shapes public perception of organ donation. Participation is voluntary.” To avoid automated responses, participants were required to enter a unique code at survey completion in order to receive the standard prime panel payment of $1.25 per participant. This study was deemed exempt by our hospital’s Institutional Review Board Electronic Application Review System, approval number Pro00008933.
Data collection
The survey was made available in May 2018 and closed after 45 hours when the target sample size was reached. The survey contained demographic information, questions regarding pediatric and adult organ donation, questions regarding brain death, and an open-ended section for comments. Survey components were extrapolated from factors and themes identified in prior literature as barriers to organ donation consent. The specific language and content for the survey questions were designed to target these previously illuminated themes including mistrust of the healthcare system, confusion surrounding brain death, and physicians motivations in declaration of death, as well as beliefs that organ procurement practices favor wealthy, famous, and non-minority demographics, while marginalizing individuals viewed as poor and minority demographics. Face validity was established by review of the survey with experts in the field.
Data analysis
The targeted sample size was 400 based on 70% estimation of organ donation acceptability with 95% confidence intervals ± 5% margin of error. There was an 86% participation rate. The participation rate reflects the percent of participants who viewed the survey and ultimately completed the survey. We had a 14% “bounce rate” which is the percentage of individuals who viewed the survey and decided not to take it. All participants who started the survey completed it in its entirety.
Acceptability of organ donation with 95% confidence intervals was estimated using exact binomial estimates. Subsequently, logistic regression was used to examine associations between respondent characteristics and beliefs around organ donation. Analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 for PC (SAS). A two-sided P-value of .05 was considered significant for all analyses.
RESULTS
A total of 425 surveys were completed (Appendix 1). Demographic characteristics (Table 1) revealed that parents were mostly female (80%), White (76%), and aged 26–35 (37.4%). The largest group of participants earned between $20 000 and $40 000 (32.2%) and attended some college without a degree (32.7%).
The vast majority of respondents (76%) reported they would be willing to donate their own organs (95% CI 71.7%–78.0%) or their tissue 69.4% (95% CI 64.8%–73.8%). A lower majority (65.2%) reported willingness to donate their child’s organs (95% CI 60.4%–69.7%) or tissue 57.9% (95% CI 53.0%–62.6%).
Influence of race and ethnicity on organ donation
Compared with White respondents, Black respondents were 5.3 times (95% CI 2.81–9.88) and Hispanic participants were 2.24 (95% CI 1.06–4.75) more likely to believe doctors “steal organs from patients.” Black respondents were also 4.97 times (95% CI 2.65–9.32) and Hispanic respondents were 2.19 times (95% CI 1.01–4.72) more likely to believe doctors declare someone dead based on their skin color (Table 2). Adjusting for income and education, African American and Hispanic participants remained more likely to believe doctors steal organs from patients (aOR = 4.79, 95% CI 2.52–9.11, aOR = 2.34, 95% CI 1.08–5.07, respectively).
Influence of income and education on organ donation
Lower income participants were more likely to believe doctors steal organs from patients and that doctors declare someone dead based on how much money they have (OR lowest income category vs highest 2.47, Table 3). Odds of believing doctors declare someone dead based on how much money they have decreased as income increased (OR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.67–0.96), as well as believing that doctors “steal organs” (OR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.68–0.96). Lower income was no longer associated with this belief following adjustment for other factors, though a significant decreasing trend across income remained (aOR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.67–0.98).
Influence of opinions about brain death on organ donation
Less than half of respondents (47.1%) reported believing someone who is declared brain dead is actually dead, and a similar minority (45.4%) believed someone who is declared brain dead can wake up. Respondents who believed brain death is synonymous to death were 2.37 times more likely to report they would donate their own organs, compared with those who do not share this belief (95% CI 1.48–3.80). A similar trend was noted regarding parent’s willingness to donate their child’s organs (OR = 2.42 CI 1.60–3.67, Table 4). We also found income significantly associated with belief someone who is declared brain dead is actually dead, with lower income participants significantly less likely to believe that brain death is synonymous with death (OR = 0.26, 95% CI 0.13–0.52).
Overall, 66 (15.5%) respondents reported having a family member who had been declared brain dead. Respondents who had a family member declared brain dead were 2.41 times more likely to believe someone who is brain dead is actually dead compared with those who did not have a family member declared brain dead (95% CI 1.39–4.16). These respondents were more likely than those who had not had a family member declared brain dead to believe that doctors steal organs from patients. The association persisted following adjustment for race, education, and income (aOR = 2.56, 95% CI 1.41–4.66).
DISCUSSION
Crowdsourcing mediums such as Amazon MTurk is a promising resource to answer a variety of research questions given the diversity of participants and ease of use in investigating emotionally charged topics such as organ donation and brain death. We found an overall willingness to donate ones organs, similar to the rate of 70% reported in the literature. Despite high reported acceptability of donating one’s own organs or their child’s organs, there are insufficient organs available for those in need in the United States, especially among racial and ethnic minorities, who comprise 58% of the transplant waiting list and are less likely to donate their organs or a loved ones organs. We found that Black parents were five times more likely to mistrust a doctor’s motivations for organ donation, including beliefs that doctors steal organs or request organs based on skin color. Hispanic parents were twice as likely to mistrust doctors’ motivations, as were lower income parents. This mistrust of the healthcare system is complex and may be due to an overall lack of trust and even fear that the team will not attempt resuscitation if he or she is an organ donor.
As a field, we have a lot of work to do to repair relationships with minority communities. Historically, minority populations have experienced unethical medical treatment. This has ranged from diagnosing Blacks as “psychologically unfit for freedom” and more notorious examples such as the Tuskegee syphilis experiment and the case of “Tucker’s Heart,” where in 1968 a black heart was transplanted into a white recipient without familial consent. Unfortunately, the disparities throughout our healthcare system continue with new studies emphasizing growing disparities, ranging from later stage cancer diagnoses to inadequate analgesia in the emergency department setting and decreased availability of renal transplants for eligible minorities. Findings from the present study highlight this distrust as an important barrier that physicians must overcome if we want to encourage organ donation in this population. It is imperative that physicians are not only aware of this mistrust, but also find strategies to discuss organ donation with cultural sensitivity.
The concept of brain death is difficult for many families to understand. Our results suggest that individuals who believed in the concept of brain death may be more willing to donate his or her organs as well as his or her child’s organs. We also found individuals who had a family member declared brain dead were more willing to donate organs. These findings emphasize the value of education regarding brain death and its significance. Within the medical community, this topic remains one of great controversy which creates a barrier providers must overcome when having these life-altering discussions with families. We also acknowledge the abundance of false information available to the lay public regarding this topic. Our research group has previously looked specifically at the misinformation the public is exposed to through various social media platforms including Google and YouTube. We believe provider and trainee education may be the best strategy to combat this misinformation to ensure consistency in following the national guidelines for declaration of brain death. Providing trainees and faculty access to simulations and role play in brain death disclosure are valuable tools to help providers find language that is honest and understandable to grieving families. There are real consequences to families not understanding and/or believing the determination of brain death, including further mistrust of the medical system and a lower likelihood of organ donation. The goal of the healthcare team is being transparent when describing this complicated and emotional topic so that parents are fully informed regarding the option of organ donation.
Limitations
To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate public perception of organ donation and brain death using MTurk. Although there are strengths of this paper, there are limitations to consider. This study utilized Amazon MTurk Prime, which, although has been validated in numerous studies, still has limitations similar to other survey-based methods. These include inability to validate participant’s responses as accurate and generation of samples that may not be completely representative of the US population. Additionally, our cohort had an overrepresentation of females (80%) when compared to the national average (51%). Despite this overrepresentation, this finding is not different from other parental surveys, where mothers are often overrepresented. As with other online platforms, we were only able to capture a small subset of individuals whom have access to the Internet and our findings do not reflect the views of individuals without access to the Internet.
It is important to note that crowdsourcing relies on individuals whom are paid a relatively small fee for service. Prior studies have found many crowdsourcing participants intrinsically motivated by altruism and not extrinsically motivated through financial incentives, which is reflected in the socioeconomic representation of our participants, with the majority (51.8%) earning more than $40 000 per year (19.1% earning > $80 000). Despite the intrinsic motivation of many crowdsourcing participants, it is important for the medical community to strive for ethical working conditions for research participants utilized in all studies.
CONCLUSIONS
Despite willingness to personally donate and to donate the organs of their child, there is a mistrust of healthcare providers’ motivations for organ donation, especially among racial and ethnic minorities and lower socioeconomic groups. Future studies should investigate how the healthcare team can better support and inform all parents about brain death and organ donation, especially among parents who frequently feel disenfranchised. The use of crowdsourcing may be a unique methodology to continue to explore this and other emotionally charged critical care topics.
