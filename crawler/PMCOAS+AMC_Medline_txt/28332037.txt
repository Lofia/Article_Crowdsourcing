Comparing Self-Reported Demographic and Sexual Behavioral Factors among Men who have Sex with Men Recruited through Mechanical Turk, Qualtrics, and a HIV/STI Clinic-based Sample: Implications for Researchers and Providers
Recruitment for HIV research among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) has increasingly moved to the online sphere. However, there are limited data comparing the characteristics of clinic-based respondents versus those recruited via online survey platforms. MSM were recruited from three sampling sites (STI clinic, MTurk, and Qualtrics) to participate in a survey from March 2015 to April 2016. Respondents were compared between each of the sampling sites on demographics, sexual history, substance use, and attention filter passage. Attention filter passage was high for the online sampling sites (MTurk = 93%; Qualtrics = 86%), but significantly lower for the clinic-based sampling site (72%). Clinic-based respondents were significantly more racially/ethnically diverse, reported lower income, and more unemployment than online respondents. Clinic-based respondents reported significantly more male sexual partners in the previous three months (mean clinic-based = 6; MTurk = 3.6; Qualtrics = 4.5), a higher proportion of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and/or syphilis in the last year, and a greater proportion of methamphetamine use (clinic-based = 21%; MTurk = 5%), and inhaled nitrates use (clinic-based = 41%; MTurk = 11%). The clinic-based sample demonstrated more demographic diversity and a greater proportion of HIV risk behaviors when compared to the online samples, but also a relatively low attention filter passage rate. We recommend the use of attention filters across all modalities to assess response validity and urge caution with online survey engines as samples may differ demographically and behaviorally when compared to clinic-based respondents.
INTRODUCTION
Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) are at high risk for a range of health issues including substance abuse and psychiatric disorders which are associated with an elevated incidence of HIV. Periodic surveys are important in order to understand emerging and changing HIV risk factors among MSM. These data can then be used to design HIV prevention interventions that address the diversity and specific circumstances of MSM environments. Although MSM are a priority population in HIV prevention research, conducting extensive research has been particularly difficult due to length of time and cost of in-person and telephone surveys.
In the past ten years, traditional telephone and face-to-face survey methods have increasingly been replaced by online research methods. Previous studies have shown that online surveys can produce as reliable data as both telephone and in-person surveys. However, while these new methods are promising, they have a number of challenges for behavioral research including repeat participation, higher rates of dropout, underrepresentation of African-American and Latino respondents, and reduced control when compared to laboratory conditions. These issues can lead to biased estimates and a lack of data for sub-populations of MSM facing the highest rates of HIV infection.
Previous studies have attempted to assess the comparability of online and in-person samples for MSM. A 2009 study assessed the comparability and random digit dialing internet-based samples and found that internet samples yielded more accurate responses. A European study found that MSM recruited in the European MSM Internet Survey had a lower median age when compared to surveillance data. A study among MSM in the United States found that individuals recruited from internet venue-based sampling differed significantly from those in the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance and Web-Based HIV Behavioral Surveillance by self-reported factors such as age, income, substance use, and HIV serostatus. A study based in New York City compared MSM recruited from bathhouses, bars/clubs and Craigslist.org and found substantial demographic and behavioral differences. Lastly, a study in Atlanta found that MSM recruited via Facebook yielded similar results to those recruited via venue-based, time-space sampling. Although previous studies have utilized incentives, to our knowledge, no studies have assessed the comparability of in-person MSM samples to those drawn from paid survey engines like Qualtrics and Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk).
Qualtrics and MTurk have existed since 2002 and 2005, respectively, and allow researchers to conduct surveys in communities that are traditionally hard to reach. The Qualtrics model allows researchers to develop surveys using Qualtrics software and then request participant pools, or panels, where subjects are recruited by Qualtrics using the researcher’s specified criteria. Researchers are quoted a price per subject based on the specificity of criteria, and the results are returned to the researcher at the completion of recruitment. In contrast, MTurk allows researchers to choose the compensation amount and survey modality through the creation of human intelligence tasks (HITs). Researchers directly post advertisements to their surveys on the MTurk worker space, and MTurk users can find surveys that pertain to them by searching by keywords and compensation amount. Previous studies have assessed the validity of MTurk for behavioral studies, but no studies to date have assessed the comparability of MSM respondents to clinic-based surveys.
The primary objective of this study was to compare the demographic and HIV risk differences between online samples of MSM recruited on MTurk and Qualtrics with a convenience sample of MSM recruited in community-based clinic in Los Angeles. A secondary objective was to compare the costs and time of participant recruitment and incentives across the MTurk, Qualtrics, and an STI clinic (subsequently referred to as “clinic-based”) sampling sites to inform researchers and providers about the advantages and disadvantages of each modality for HIV behavioral research.
METHOD
Recruitment
The survey was programmed for all three sampling sites with Qualtrics software with a target recruitment of 200 respondents per sampling site. The survey was completed directly on the Qualtrics portal for the Qualtrics sampling site, and a link was provided for the clinic-based and MTurk sampling sites (Link to Survey: https://uscsocialwork.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_3HLElR6IWN2QTw9).
MTurk respondents were recruited from April 1st, 2015 to May 11th, 2015. Respondents were allowed to access the survey to determine eligibility if they had an address located in the United States and had an HIT approval rate (proportion of tasks that have been submitted and approved) of 95% or above. Respondents were directed to the survey if they used one or more of the following key words: gay/bisexual men, men who have sex with men, research, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, New York. These cities were chosen due to their size as well as having large defined, gay-centered areas. The recruitment script can be found in Appendix 1. Following survey completion, respondents were provided with a unique code to redeem their incentive.
Qualtrics respondents were recruited from June 24th to June 30th, 2015 by a requested Qualtrics panel that consisted of the following criteria: residents of Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, or New York City metro areas; ages 18+; must be assigned a male sex at birth and currently identify as male; sex with a man in the last three months. The inclusion/exclusion criteria were the same for all three sampling sites.
Clinic-based respondents were recruited from July 28th, 2015 to March 15th, 2016 by HIV/STI testing counselors of a community-based clinic in Los Angeles. All clients receiving HIV/STI testing interface with an HIV/STI testing counselor and therefore were eligible for recruitment during this period. For recruitment script, see Appendix 1.
Survey
Upon clicking on the survey link, individuals were provided informed consent and asked to complete a screening tool to assess study eligibility. Individuals who met the inclusion criteria were asked a series of questions about their demographics, sexual behaviors in the past three months, history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), substance use history, and knowledge about pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Questions for the survey were adapted from the full risk assessment used during HIV/STI screening by the community-based clinic for which the in-person sample was drawn. Qualtrics policy did not allow for the inclusion of the substance use questions, but these questions were asked in the MTurk and clinic-based sampling sites. Otherwise, the three questionnaires were identical.
Qualtrics and MTurk participants completed the survey from their own computers. Clinic-based respondents completed the survey on one of two tablets that were located in the waiting room of the community-based clinic in Los Angeles. Both tablets were equipped with privacy screens to protect the confidentiality of respondents.
Compensation
MTurk respondents were initially paid $0.50 for their participation. After one month of recruitment (April 1st, 2015 – May 1st, 2015), only 3 respondents had been recruited and the compensation level was increased to $1 for participation (May 8th – May 11th, 2015). Upon survey completion, a unique code was used to redeem their incentive. Qualtrics was paid at a rate of $6 per subject, but the actual payment amount from Qualtrics to respondents was between $2 and $3. Individuals who did not meet the inclusion criteria in MTurk were still monetarily compensated for their participation following the screening tool. Clinic-based respondents were provided with a code at the end of the survey and instructed to inform the HIV/STI testing counselor of this code to confirm survey completion and redeem a $10 gift card to either Target or Trader Joe’s.
Statistical analyses
The primary goal of this study was to compare the two online venues (MTurk and Qualtrics sampling sites) to a sample of MSM recruited in clinic. Categorical predictors were compared between these three groups under study via χ2 tests or Fisher Exact Tests when one or more cells had counts less than 5. Continuous predictors had non-normal distributions and were compared Kruskal-Wallis tests. Four multivariable logistic regression models were run to determine differences between sampling sites on demographics, sexual risk behaviors, substance use, and PrEP knowledge. All statistical tests used an alpha level of 0.05 and were calculated in SAS version 9.4 (Cary, NC). All protocols for the study were approved and overseen by the institutional review board of the researchers’ academic institution.
RESULTS
Recruitment and Screening
A total of 511 respondents clicked on the survey for the MTurk sampling site, and 267 met the inclusion criteria for analysis. Of the 244 who were not qualified, 53 were cisgender female (22%); 21 reported a non-male gender identity (9%); 77 had not had sex with another man in the past three months (32%); 84 did not live in Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, or New York City (34%); 9 quit before eligibility could be determined (4%).
A total of 366 respondents clicked on the survey for the Qualtrics sampling site, and 211 met the inclusion criteria for analysis. Of the 155 who were not qualified, six were cisgender female (4%); 13 reported a non-male gender identity (8%); 104 had not had sex with another man in the past three months (67%); 25 did not live in Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, or New York City (16%); three were less than 18 years of age (2%); four quit before eligibility could be determined (3%).
A total of 317 respondents clicked on the survey for the clinic-based sampling site, and 231 met the inclusion criteria for analysis. Of the 86 who were not qualified, 11 were cisgender female (13%); 19 reported a non-male gender identity (22%); 24 had not had sex with another man in the past three months (28%); 11 did not live in Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, or New York City (13%); 21 quit before eligibility could be determined (24%).
Attention Filter
A question was inserted three quarters through the survey that asked participants to answer “Disagree” for the question to determine if they were paying attention (known as an “attention filter” or “instructional manipulation check”) and thus assess survey validity. Approximately 86% of Qualtrics users, 93% of MTurk users, and 72% of clinic-based users passed this attention filter (Chi-square = 41; p < 0.0001). Participants were allowed to complete the survey and compensated regardless of their passage of the attention filter. However, demographic and behavioral results are presented only for those who passed the attention filter.
Demographic Differences
Qualtrics users were significantly older than the other two sampling sites with a reported mean age of 41 (median = 41; SD = 14) compared to a mean age of 29 for both MTurk and clinic-based respondents (median = 28; SD = 7) (Table 1). Qualtrics respondents and MTurk respondents were more likely to report a White race, 66% and 63% respectively, when compared to clinic-based respondents (25%). The highest proportion of Hispanic participants was recruited for the clinic-based sampling site (43%) compared to 15% for MTurk and 20% for Qualtrics. Approximately 22% of individuals in the Qualtrics sampling site reported a graduate degree whereas only 12% reported this in the MTurk sampling site and 7% in the clinic-based sampling site. Lastly, Qualtrics users reported a much higher income on average with 45% reporting more than $50,000 per year compared to only 27% and 11% with this proportion for MTurk and clinic-based sampling sites, respectively. However, a substantial proportion of individuals in all three sampling sites refused to answer this question (Range: 15–34%).
Sexual History Differences
MTurk respondents reported the highest mean number of female sexual partners in the past three months (1.9) followed by Qualtrics respondents (1.5) and clinic-based respondents (1.1) (Table 2). Conversely, clinic-based respondents reported the highest mean number of male sexual partners in the past three months (6) followed by Qualtrics respondents (4.5) and MTurk respondents (3.6). Clinic-based respondents reported most frequently meeting partners on geosocial networking apps like Grindr and Scruff (44%) whereas MTurk respondents met most commonly in bars/clubs (53%) and Qualtrics users met most commonly on gay-centered websites like Adam4Adam and Manhunt (25%).
All three sampling sites differed on reported history of gonorrhea: 28% of clinic-based respondents, 2% of MTurk respondents, and 6% of Qualtrics respondents reported testing positive for gonorrhea within the past year. Similar trends were also observed for chlamydia and syphilis.
Substance Use Differences
As stated previously, Qualtrics users were not asked about substance use due to a company policy that prohibited questions about illegal drug use from panel participants. A similar proportion of clinic-based (18%) and MTurk respondents (12%) reported using cocaine or crack in the past year (Table 3). The same trend was observed for ecstasy use among clinic-based and MTurk respondents at 16% and 17%, respectively. However, 21% of clinic-based respondents reported methamphetamine use in the last year compared with only 5% of MTurk respondents. Similarly, 41% of clinic-based respondents reported nitrates/poppers use in the last year compared to only 11% of MTurk respondents.
Differences in Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) Knowledge/Attitudes
Clinic-based respondents and Qualtrics respondents were most likely to report that they knew a fair amount or a lot about PrEP, and MTurk respondents were most likely to report that they either knew only a little or nothing at all about PrEP before taking the survey (Table 4). In total 5% of Qualtrics respondents, 3% of MTurk respondents, and 10% of clinic-based respondents indicated they were currently taking PrEP. After being informed that PrEP was at least 90% effective in preventing HIV if taken every day, significantly more participants from the clinic-based sampling site said that they would definitely want to take PrEP when compared to the MTurk and Qualtrics sampling sites. However, when asked about their likelihood to use PrEP, the greatest proportion from each sampling site choose the option that stated, “I’m not sure, I might begin taking PrEP.”
DISCUSSION
Our study found that online samples of MSM recruited from Qualtrics and MTurk differed on demographics, sexual history, substance use, and PrEP knowledge when compared to participants surveyed in a clinic-based sample in Los Angeles, California. The advantages of the clinic-based sampling site included the racial/ethnic diversity and the greatest HIV risk, but this could be the artifact of the clinic’s location in Los Angeles, an economically and racially/ethnically diverse urban environment. The disadvantages of the clinic-based sampling site included the low passage of the attention filter, long recruitment time (230 days), high cost per subject ($10 per subject), and high indirect costs (staff time for recruitment, purchase of iPads for survey completion, and hardware for securing the iPads). The advantages of the Qualtrics sampling site were the ease and speed of recruitment (7 days) and lower cost per subject when compared to the in-person sample ($6 per subject), but the disadvantages included relatively lower demographic diversity, a substantially different HIV risk profile when compared to other modalities, and the inability to ask questions about substance use. The MTurk sampling site advantages included the lowest cost per subject ($1 per subject), the quickest recruitment (only 3 days after increasing the incentive from $0.50 to $1), and the highest attention filter passage rate (93%). Although the MTurk sampling site was more diverse and reported higher HIV risk behaviors than the Qualtrics sampling site, there was lower demographic diversity and condomless anal sex (CAS) when compared to the clinic-based sampling site.
There are numerous limitations to this analysis. While MTurk and Qualtrics respondents were recruited from four major metropolitan areas across the United States (Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, or New York City), the clinic-based sampling site only recruited participants from Los Angeles. Furthermore, individuals who visited the community-based clinic in Los Angeles for HIV/STI testing, treatment, or other biomedical prevention services and agreed to participate in the survey, may be different from other MSM in Los Angeles who either receive testing services at another facility or did not agree to participate in the survey. A second limitation was that the survey time could not be accurately recorded for all clinic-based respondents due to frequent network errors that prompted reloading of the survey home page. A third limitation was the high proportion of missing data for certain questions (Range: 0% – 34%). A fourth limitation was that while the clinic-based sampling site reported both higher levels of substance use and previous STIs, the polling of individuals from an HIV/STI testing clinic presents a potential for selection bias in recent CAS events may have prompted the visit to the HIV/STI clinic. Other methods for identifying potential participants, such as time-space sampling have the ability to reduce some bias in sample selection, but are also not without limitations including high cost and high refusal rates. Studies looking to replicate our findings should consider the strengths and weaknesses of various recruitment and sampling approaches to obtain the most representative sample of MSM. Lastly, we note that there are many venues in which we did not recruit from (e.g., bars/clubs, bathhouses) as well as emerging popular digital venues (i.e., geosocial networking apps like Grindr and Scruff) that may capture yet another segment of MSM. Future studies looking at sampling representativeness should also incorporate these survey modalities into their study designs.
Despite these limitations, there are numerous strengths to our study. Few studies have compared demographics between traditional and online recruitment methods. In a study comparing samples from a telephone interview and MTurk, researchers showed that the samples produced similar demographic profiles. In a study comparing MTurk users to 1) a sample recruited on Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit and 2) an in-person sample of college students, researchers found that the demographics of the samples differed, but the MTurk participants were more economically and racially diverse. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies to date that have compared the representativeness of Qualtrics users to more traditional recruitment methods. However, the older age and lack of racial diversity in the Qualtrics panel highlights the potential need to specify age, race, and ethnicity quotas when requesting Qualtrics panels. Future studies seeking to replicate similar population comparisons should also consider recruiting across multiple clinics as our results may be biased due to the location and population served.
A second strength is that we compared the validity of survey responses based on the use of an attention filter. A previous study showed that attention filters are a powerful tool in assessing accuracy of self-assessments. Given these findings, we strongly recommend the use of attention filters to gauge response validity from both online and clinic-based respondents. In addition, future studies may consider comparing the validity of results with multiple attention filters compared to only a single attention filter to further understand how to maximize respondent engagement.
As the use of online assessments continues to grow, evaluations of new and existing survey modalities are important. Online survey tools like Qualtrics and MTurk have many strengths when compared to clinic-based samples including lower relative cost, faster recruitment due to decreased barriers for study participation, increased confidentiality, and the possibility to include a more diverse sample. Despite these benefits, these methods are not without limits. Our study found sampling biases that lead us to suggest caution when using these methods for behavioral research. It’s important for researchers planning to use these methods to carefully develop quotas (in the case of Qualtrics) and/or detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria (in the case of MTurk) to obtain demographically representative samples. The use of one or more attention filters should be implemented to maximize respondent validity. Lastly, future research should focus on how to best obtain samples that best approximate population demographics and trends. These methods will never be perfect, but the potential benefits to both researchers and participants warrant further development of best practices for the field.

Clinic-based respondents were recruited for the survey by testing counselors at a community-based clinic in Los Angeles
Periodically, the iPad for the clinic-based arm needed to be checked for internet connectivity. This was done by navigating from the consent screen to the first screening question and back. Although this was not counted as a response, the time counter was continuous during these checks and therefore the data for survey completion time for clinic-based respondents overestimate the actual time spent on the survey. Therefore, data are not presented.
