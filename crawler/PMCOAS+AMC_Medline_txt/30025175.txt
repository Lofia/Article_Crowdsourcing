Crowdsourcing Trauma: Psychopathology in a Trauma-Exposed Sample Recruited via Mechanical Turk
Although crowdsourcing websites like Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) allow researchers to conduct research efficiently, it is unclear if MTurk and traditionally recruited samples are comparable when assessing the sequela of traumatic events. We compared the responses to validated self-report measures of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and related constructs that were given by 822 participants recruited via MTurk and had experienced a DSM-5 Criterion A traumatic event to responses obtained in recent samples of participants recruited via traditional methods. Results suggested that the rate of PTSD in the present sample (19.8%) was statistically higher than that found in a recent systematic review of studies that used only traditional recruitment methods. The severity of PTSD reported in the MTurk sample was significantly greater than that reported in a college sample, d = 0.24, and significantly less than that reported in a veteran sample, d = 0.90. The factor structure of PTSD found in the MTurk sample was consistent with prevailing models of PTSD. Findings indicate that crowdsourcing may improve access to this hard-to-reach population.
Exposure to potentially traumatic events (PTEs) increases risk for psychiatric disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Approximately 6.8% of adults in the United States experience PTSD. Posttraumatic stress disorder is associated with significant impairment, with disability persisting even when symptoms remit. Given the public health burden imposed by PTEs, continued research on PTSD and other trauma-related conditions is needed; however, PTSD includes symptoms such as avoidance of reminders of the PTE and social withdrawal. These symptoms are barriers to recruitment for research on PTE-related psychopathology, and strategies to overcome these barriers are needed.
Individuals with PTSD may be reluctant to attend in-person research studies that require disclosure of trauma-related information. Relatedly, stigma impedes disclosure of information about traumatic experiences or symptoms. As such, traditional recruitment methods may miss individuals who are unwilling to discuss trauma symptoms in person—a potentially significant portion of PTE-exposed research candidates. What’s more, traditional media recruitment strategies, such as television, radio, and newspaper advertisements, are often expensive and inconsistent. Researchers may instead recruit from clinical services, such as emergency departments or specialty clinics that serve this population. People recruited via these avenues often have competing priorities (e.g., pressing clinical or functional needs) that prevent research participation. Additionally, recruitment strategies for in-person research are restricted by the geographical location in which the research is being conducted, which limits demographic diversity. The academic institution where the present study was conducted is located in a sparsely populated region of the United States that has limited racial/ethnic and socioeconomic diversity. The barriers of these methods have historically limited the scope of research on traumatic stress.
The Internet provides an alternative for recruiting samples for psychological research that addresses many of the aforementioned barriers (i.e., stigma, burden, geographical limitations). Internet access among adults in the United States increased from 52% in 2000 to 88% in 2016, and 77% of adults in the United States presently own a mobile device with Internet capabilities. These rates of Internet usage are seen across socioeconomic groups, making it a promising method for connecting with underserved groups that are at higher risk for exposure to PTEs.
Research spanning the past several decades has suggested that digital technologies may offer superior methods for collecting data on sensitive or stigmatized information relative to in-person interviews. found that the internet was a preferred medium for information-seeking on health topics due to time efficiency and ease of use. These findings suggest that conducting mental health research on trauma via digital technologies could eliminate the interpersonal barriers associated with discussing a PTE or its sequelae.
Over the last decade, social scientists have begun to use Internet-based crowdsourcing platforms, such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk), for experimental and survey-based research on human participants. MTurk is a platform on which individuals called “requesters” publish jobs, referred to as Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs), and pay individuals called “workers” to complete them. Crowdsourcing is a low-cost, time-efficient, and user-friendly means of accessing a large number of research participants; this has fueled its use for recruitment. The number of social science publications using MTurk data grew from fewer than 50 in 2011 to nearly 550 in 2015. This influx in MTurk studies has led to questions about the representativeness of MTurk versus in-person samples. Past research has found that MTurk samples are more demographically representative, albeit younger, than convenience samples recruited in person.
The question of representativeness is a key barrier to the adoption of MTurk for mental health related-research. Although there has been an increase in the use of the Internet for research in other social sciences, MTurk’s use in mental health research has lagged. Between 2011 and 2015, the number of publications in clinical psychology and psychiatry that used MTurk rose from zero to 50. Few studies have examined the representativeness of mental health data collected via this method. In the first study to do so, concluded that MTurk is a feasible means to evaluate samples with clinically relevant psychopathology and found that prevalence rates of clinically relevant depression symptoms, drug abuse, and PTE exposure were consistent with rates found in the general population. Further, the quality of the authors’ MTurk data was high (i.e., high internal validity on psychodiagnositc assessments, comparable associations between psychopathology and demographics to those of in-person samples). This suggests that MTurk respondents may have rates of psychopathology similar to those found in the general population. A thorough examination of the prevalence of trauma exposure and the phenomenology of its associated psychological disorders in an MTurk sample is called for.
There are several metrics by which to evaluate the quality of data collected from participants recruited via novel methods. First, the prevalence of the constructs of interest should be comparable. National estimates of PTSD in individuals who have experienced a PTE range from 6.2–22.9%. Second, the factor structure of the constructs of interest should be the same, as this would suggest that symptom assessments obtained from a trauma-exposed MTurk sample are similar to those obtained via other methods. Factor analyses have supported the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.) organization of PTSD symptoms into four clusters: intrusions, avoidance, negative alterations in cognitions and mood (NACM), and alterations in arousal and reactivity (AAR; King,). More recently, a seven-factor hybrid model that includes clusters for intrusions, avoidance, negative affect, anhedonia, externalizing, anxious arousal, and dysphoric arousal was proposed. Finally, previously found associations between the construct of interest and demographic as well as other factors (e.g., related posttrauma psychopathology) should be observed. In prior work, researchers have found high comorbidity between common posttraumatic psychopathologies (i.e., PTSD, depression, and generalized anxiety disorder [GAD]) and that women tend to report more severe posttraumatic psychopathology than men. Results from several studies have highlighted the comorbidity between these conditions.
In the present study, we examined whether data collected via a large MTurk sample of PTE-exposed individuals was comparable to that obtained through traditional methods. The MTurk sample was considered comparable and representative of the general PTE-exposed sample if (a) the prevalence of likely PTSD and related psychopathologies was similar to those repoted in other studies; (b) the factor structure of PTSD (DSM-5 and hybrid models) was replicated; (c) expected associations between PTSD scores and demographic factors were found; and (d) expected associations between PTSD and other psychopathology, including depression and GAD, were found, as they so frequently co-occur. Variables relevant to crowdsourcing, (i.e., time taken to complete an assessment, time needed to collect the desired sample size, number of valid cases) were assessed to determine the number of MTurk participants required to obtain an adequate clinical sample.
Method
Participants and Procedure
Participants were recruited through six MTurk HITs seeking participants to complete questionnaires assessing the impact of stressful events on individuals’ lives with the following keywords: survey, stress, gender, women/men, and health. Participants could access the HIT only if they had a United States–based internet protocol (IP) address and a 65% approval rating from other requesters for prior HITs. Participants were given 1 hr to complete all measures and were compensated $1.25 (USD) for approved work. MTurk provides usage data for HITs (e.g., timestamps for HIT publication and recruitment completion, average HIT completion time). Inclusion criteria for the study included exposure to a Criterion A traumatic event, defined as direct exposure to one of the events on the Life Events Checklist–5 (LEC-5). Individuals who did not endorse a PTE on the LEC-5 were notified of their ineligibility, barred from proceeding or reopening the HIT through IP blocking, and were not compensated. This study was approved by the University of Vermont Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects Research.
Measures
Traumatic event exposure
The Life Events Checklist-5 (LEC-5) is a 17-item self-report measure that assesses exposure to PTEs across the life span. Participants are asked to endorse exposure to 16 known events, with an item included to assess exposure to other extraordinary stressful events. We administered the extended version of the LEC, in which participants were asked to describe the worst event that had happened to them and provide additional information about the circumstances under which it occurred.
PTSD symptoms
The PTSD Checklist-5 (PCL-5) is a 20-item self-report measure that assesses DSM-5 PTSD symptoms the participant has experienced in the last month. Items assess symptoms across four symptom clusters of PTSD, including intrusions, dysphoria, NACM, and AAR, on a Likert-type scale of 0 to 4. Total scores range from 0–80, with a score of 33 or greater indicating likely PTSD. The PCL-5 was anchored to the most relevant trauma on the LEC. Internal consistency was Cronbach’s α = .95.
Depression
The Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) is an eight-item self-report measure that assesses depression symptoms experienced in the last two weeks. Participants rate symptom frequency on a scale of 0 to 3. Scores range from 0 to 24 with higher scores indicating more severe depression. Consistent with prior work, the present study employed a cutoff score of 10 to differentiate individuals with moderate to severe symptomology from those with little to no symptomology. The PHQ-8 is identical to the PHQ-9 except for the removal of an item on suicidal ideation. Given the intrinsically anonymous nature of MTurk research, it was deemed inappropriate to collect information on ideation/risk from participants upon which the clinical research team could not follow up to assess for safety. Internal consistency was Cronbach’s α = .91.
Anxiety
The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) is a seven-item self-report measure that assesses GAD symptoms the participant has experienced in the last two weeks. Ratings are made on a Likert scale from 0 to 3, with scores ranging from 0 to 21. Higher scores correspond to more severe symptoms. Validation studies have suggested a score of 10 or higher is indicative of severe GAD symptoms. Internal consistency was Cronbach’s α = .92.
PTSD prevalence rates
We obtained estimates of PTSD prevalence from two sources. The first was a systematic review of 35 longitudinal studies examining rates of PTSD within 12 months after a PTE. In this review, authors selected studies that used validated measures capturing DSM-5 criteria for PTSD, yielding a mean 12-month prevalence of 17.0%. None of the included studies used online methods for data collection. To compare the prevalence of PTSD in the present study to that found in another online sample, we used data published by. Using DSM-5 criteria, the 12-month prevalence was 8.3%. Estimates of comorbid conditions that result from trauma exposure were obtained from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). This is the most recent in-person survey to assess PTSD and its comorbid disorders using a large community-based sample of adults. The prevalence rates of PTSD, depression, and GAD were 6.4%, 17.3%, and 8.3%, respectively.
Data Analysis
We conducted primary analyses in SPSS (Version 24). Examination revealed that all variables met assumptions of normality. A series of comparisons using analyses of variance (ANOVAs) with α = .05 were conducted to determine whether any relevant differences existed on variables of interest by demographic characteristics (e.g., gender). We used chi-square tests to compare the prevalence of likely PTSD, depression, and anxiety in our sample to those found in other studies, and relevant differences in symptom severity were assessed using independent samples t tests. Associations between PTSD, depression, and GAD were examined using bivariate correlations.
Confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were conducted using MPlus (Version 7.11) to assess the fit of the factor structure of PTSD symptoms across the DSM-5 and hybrid models, respectively. Factor variances were scaled to 1 and residual covariances were set to zero. Models were estimated using a polychoric covariance matrix, robust weighted least squares estimation with a mean-and-variance adjusted chi-square (WLSMV) and probit regression coefficients. Model fit was evaluated per recommendations. Excellent fit was defined as having a comparative fit index (CFI) and Tucker Lewis Index (TLI) ≥ .95 and a root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) value ≤ .06. Adequate fit was defined as having a CFI and TLI ≥ .90 and a RMSEA value ≤ .10. Model comparisons were conducted using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and maximum likelihood with a robust estimator (MLR) estimation for categorical variables, as this information is not obtained with WLSMV. A 10-point difference in BIC provides very strong support that the model with the lower BIC value fits best.
Results
We published six HITs to obtain complete data on 600 men and 600 women. As screening occurs within each HIT, more than 1,200 individuals had initial access. MTurk does not count people who screen out and do not complete the survey towards the 1,200 total. As a result, an additional 241 individuals accessed the HIT and were included in the overall access number. The average completion time per assessment was 20 min.
A total of 1,441 individuals accessed the HITs. A small number of participants (n = 126; 8.7%) were excluded for accessing the incorrect HIT for their gender. We assessed the validity of responses with branching logic questions and the inclusion of five questions that asked participants to select a specific response (e.g., “For this item, please select ‘Extremely’”). These items were embedded within the measures as an attention assessment. A valid case was identified as a participant who answered the majority (more than three) of these validity questions correctly and spent more than 5 min completing all measures. This approach is consistent with recommendations to improve the validity of responses on MTurk. The responses of an additional 250 (17.3%) participants were deemed invalid and were excluded (23 of these exclusions were for validity failure only). Participants who answered more than three validity questions correctly did not differ from the remaining sample in their PTSD, t(812) = 0.012, p = .761; depression, t(802) = 0.379, p = .576; or anxiety symptoms, t(801) = −1.048, p = .455.
Participants provided a description of their most traumatic experience as part of the extended form of the LEC-5. The descriptions of the remaining 1,065 participants (after exclusions) were reviewed by a licensed clinical psychologist, a clinical graduate student, and a trained bachelors-level research assistant to determine if their experiences met Criterion A for the DSM-5 PTSD diagnosis. Agreement across the raters was 100%. A total of 243 (16.9%) participants reported events that did not satisfy Criterion A (e.g., loss of a loved one in a manner that was not unexpected or violent, stressful events unassociated with a threat of injury or death). A final sample size of 822 was obtained, constituting 57.0% of individuals who attempted the HIT. Participants ranged in age from 18–82 years.
Demographic variables of the sample are presented in Table 1. Consistent with other MTurk studies, the current sample was younger and had a higher level of education than the general United States population. The sample was more ethnically diverse than prior MTurk samples in that 73.8% identified as White and non-Hispanic. Participants endorsed a wide array of PTEs (Table 2). The most commonly endorsed PTEs were motor vehicle accidents (61.1%), exposure to natural disasters (39.4%), and physical assault without a weapon (37.8%). Of participants, 19.3% reported sexual assault and 31.3% reported another unwanted sexual experience.
Descriptive information and correlations among the assessed constructs are presented in Table S1. As expected, PTSD and depression scores, r = .62, p < .001; PTSD and GAD scores, r = .62, p < .001; and depression and GAD scores were correlated, r = .84, p < .001. There was considerable variability in the symptom severity reported by participants for PTSD, depression, and anxiety as well as significant correlations among all three disorders (see Table S1). The prevalence of depression, χ2(1, N = 743) = 83.06, p < .001, and GAD, χ2(1, N = 744) = 204.67, p < .001, were significantly higher than the prevalence rates observed in prior PTE-exposed samples.
Using established cutoff criteria for each measure, 19.8% of participants reported clinically relevant PTSD symptoms (score greater than 33 on the PCL-5), 27.7% of participants reported moderate to severe depression symptoms (score greater than 10 on the PHQ-8), and 21.5% reported moderate to severe GAD symptoms (score greater than 10 on the GAD-7). Of participants who provided information on symptom severity, and using the aforementioned cutoffs for likely clinical diagnosis, 60.5% of the sample did not meet criteria for any diagnosis, 14.9% had a single likely diagnosis, and 24.6% of the sample had likely comorbid conditions. Of the total sample, 15.8% met criteria for comorbid PTSD and depression, 13.0% met criteria for comorbid PTSD and GAD, and 12.3% met criteria for all three diagnoses.
The prevalence estimate of likely PTSD in the current sample (19.8%) was statistically higher than that which was reported (17.0%) in a recent systematic review by, χ2(1, N = 741) = 4.67, p = .031 (see Table S2). It was also larger than that which was reported for the other online-recruited sample (8.3%), χ2(1, N = 741) = 143.57, p < .001 (Table S2). The severity of PTSD reported in the MTurk sample (M = 19.40, SD = 17.73, 95% CI [18.13, 20.68]) was significantly greater than that which was found in a college sample (M = 15.42, SD = 14.72, 95% CI [13.72, 17.19]), t(742) = 6.13, p < .001, and significantly less than that which was found in a veteran sample (M = 36.97, SD = 21.16, 95% CI [35.04, 38.89]), t(742)= −26.99, p < .001 (; see Table S3).
When we compared symptom severity across men and women (see Table S4), we found that women (M = 20.94, SD = 18.89) reported more severe PTSD symptoms than men (M = 17.69, SD = 16.28), F(1, 733) = 6.24, p = .013, both overall and in the symptom clusters of intrusions, F(1, 733) = 10.92, p = .001, and avoidance, F(1, 733) = 13.38, p < .001. There were no significant differences between men and women on the PTSD symptom clusters of NACM, F(1, 733) = 1.21, p = .272, or AAR, F(1, 733) = 1.61, p = .205. There were no significant differences between women (M = 6.95, SD = 6.18) and men (M = 6.18, SD = 5.64) on depression symptoms overall, F(1, 734) = 3.06, p = .081, or in the affective symptom cluster, F(1, 723) = 0.73, p = .394. However, there was a significant difference between men and women on somatic depression symptoms, F(1, 717) = 4.93, p = .027. There were no significant differences between women (M= 6.18, SD = 5.65) and men (M = 5.62, SD = 5.36) on GAD symptoms, F(1, 734) = 1.88, p = .171.
The factor structure of PTSD was evaluated for the DSM-5 and hybrid models using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Factor loadings for each model are presented in Table 3. For the DSM-5 model, items were loaded on four factors: Intrusions (Items 1–5), Avoidance (Items 6–7), NACM (Items 8–14), and AAR (Items 16–20). For the hybrid model, items were loaded on seven factors: Intrusions (Items 1–5), Avoidance (Items 6–7), Negative Affect (Items 8–11), Anhedonia (Items 12–14), Externalizing (Items 15–16), Anxious Arousal (Items 17–18), and Dysphoric Arousal (Items 19–20). Both the DSM-5 model, χ2(164, N = 741) = 883.711, p < .001, CFI = .973, TLI = .969, RMSEA = .077; and the hybrid model, χ2(149, N = 741) = 505.383, p < .001, CFI =.987, TLI = .903, RMSEA = .057, fit the data well. A comparison of the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for each model suggested that the hybrid model best fit the data as indicated the by the lowest overall value (DSM-5, BIC = 37822.235; Hybrid, BIC = 37507.279). This suggests a comparable factor structure of PTSD from the current study to that of other studies.
We evaluated the factor structure of major depression per the DSM-5 (Table S5). Items were loaded onto two factors: Affective (Items 1, 2, and 6) and Somatic Symptoms (Items 3, 4, 7, and 8). This model fit the data well, χ2(19, N = 743) = 230.895, p < .001, CFI = .903, TLI = .857, RMSEA = .123, and was comparable to data reported in previously published work.
Discussion
The present study examined the degree to which data on PTE collected via MTurk was comparable to that obtained via traditional methods. Results suggested the prevalence rate of PTSD in the MTurk sample was comparable to those observed in epidemiologic studies of PTE-exposed samples and larger than those obtained through alternative online methods. The level of PTSD severity was significantly greater than that which was found in a collegiate sample and less than that of a veteran sample. This suggests that MTurk may allow access to individuals with a more severe reaction to PTEs than has been seen in other convenience samples, such as those composed of undergraduates. However, it was expectedly less than that which was found among a population exposed to more severe PTEs (i.e., veterans). Results of a CFA suggest that the factor structures of PTSD according to the DSM-5 and hybrid models were replicated in the MTurk sample, with both models fitting the data well. The comparable fits of each structural model provide further support as to the utility of MTurk to obtain data that is generalizable to the other PTE-exposed samples. The associations between PTSD symptoms and demographic factors were as expected. We found that PTSD symptom severity was strongly correlated with both depression and GAD, and women reported more severe PTSD symptoms than men. Taken together, these findings suggest that MTurk samples are comparable to those recruited via traditional methods.
The prevalence of PTSD in the MTurk sample was clinically comparable to that which was reported in a systematic review of literature in which traditional recruitment methods had been used, speaking to the promise of crowdsourcing to provide large, reliable samples for research on the effects of trauma exposure with a high degree of efficiency. The obtained responses on measures of PTSD were consistent with previous work in PTE-exposed samples that recruited participants through telephone and in-person interviews. Internal consistency was high for all of the administered measures. That the prevalence rate of PTSD observed in the present study was approximately twice that of the rate observed in prevalence report was surprising given the similarities in the online recruitment platforms employed in both cases and the large sample sizes used in each. As such, the discrepancy in PTSD prevalence may be a function of differences in the measures used to assess PTSD or the recruitment methodologies used. Specifically, stratified their sample according to United States census demographics, which may have affected prevalence estimates.
There are several possible explanations for the elevated estimates of likely depression and GAD. Users of MTurk typically come from more diverse backgrounds with a lower socioeconomic status (SES) than participants in convenience samples, which was confirmed in the current study. As a strong correlate of most psychopathologies, SES may have accounted for the differences in rates of depression and GAD. In addition, comorbidity between PTSD, depression, and GAD is common, with recent research purporting that symptom overlap may be best understood as an expression of a broader factor of internalizing distress. Any examination of a trauma-exposed sample intrinsically selects for individuals who will have experienced distress and are therefore at higher risk for experiencing all three forms of psychopathology. Alternatively, these differences may be attributed to measurement error due to the use of cutoff scores on psychometrically validated self-report instruments as opposed to gold standard interviews.
The MTurk methodology is highly efficient relative to more traditional methods used in survey research. This approach was also cost effective in that 1,441 participants were compensated $1.25 (USD) each, and Amazon charged a service fee of $25 (USD) for a total cost of $1826.25 (USD). Adjusting for the reduced sample size of valid cases, the total cost per participant was approximately $2.22 (USD). Collecting similar data from participants in person or over the telephone would likely require more compensation. Furthermore, the entire study was administered by two individuals. It is unlikely a sample of this size could be acquired at that cost by two research assistants in a reasonable amount of time. The HITs for this study were published in waves over the course of several months, making it unfeasible to compute the exact amount of time taken to complete the study. However, the time taken to republish the survey for each HIT is negligible; thus, it is likely this takes less time than is required to create and administer the individual paper packets that are generally part of more traditional recruitment methods.
Although racial and ethnic diversity in the present sample was limited, the present MTurk sample was more demographically representative than would otherwise have been possible given the geographic location in which this work was conducted. In the present study, 73.8% of participants self-identified as White. United States census data for Vermont, the state in which the research team for the present study resides, has a population of which 95.4% of residents identify as White. Thus, it would be highly unlikely that such a sample would be collected through in-person methods in our geographic region. Alternative strategies, including telephone-based surveys, would have proven costly, and it is unclear that they would have yielded comparable ethnic proportions. It should be noted, however, that the ratio of African Americans and Latinos in the obtained sample was less than that of current United States census estimates. Given that these groups are disproportionately exposed to PTEs and underrepresented in research, scientists should consider the ramifications of relying on crowdsourced data to draw conclusions about trauma-related psychopathology in these individuals. Dedicated work is needed to further determine if MTurk and related approaches are appropriate means of recruiting samples of groups traditionally underrepresented in research.
The study had several limitations of note. First, a comprehensive psychometric validation of the administered measures was not conducted. Authors of prior work obtained 1-week retest reliability and administered a broader battery to assess convergent and divergent validity. Future work should attempt to replicate associations between psychopathology and other constructs that have been established in previous work and conduct further measure validation. Second, we were unable to independently verify if each participant experienced a PTE; thus, a portion of our sample may have provided inaccurate answers to receive compensation. However, this is a risk in many different domains of assessment, including phone and in-person interviews. To protect against this limitation, several metrics of validity were used, such as including questions that warranted a specific response, monitoring the time to completion, keeping the offered compensation offered while remaining consistent with other MTurk survey HITs, and using branching logic to remove participants who did not meet the inclusion criteria. Additional research is needed to devise a comprehensive set of strategies to improve the validity of the obtained responses. Experts in this area have begun to develop these approaches, but more work is needed to verify their success. The online, survey-based design limited the present study to the use of self-report screener items to identify prevalence rates of psychopathology. Screening measures, by design, tend to produce higher rates of psychopathology than do face-to-face clinical interviews. By contrast, the study design of was intended to closely match a clinical interview, which may account for the lower rates of PTSD they observed in their sample. The prevalence rates of psychopathology reported in the present study should thus be interpreted in light of this possible measurement bias. In addition, the study conducted by examined different time frames (i.e., PTSD symptoms reported between 3 and 12 months posttrauma) than were used in the present study in order to generate a mean 12-month PTSD prevalence rate; these differences should be taken into consideration when comparing prevalence rates between studies. Another limitation is the possibility of self-selection bias, in that individuals may have been more likely to select into the HIT if they were highly confident that their traumatic exposure applied whereas those who were unsure if they would screen in may not have accessed the HIT at all. Finally, the present study was limited in that it did not include an explicit comparison of the prevalence rates of psychopathology found in the MTurk sample to epidemiological study designs versus convenience sample study designs. Future work should examine the degree to which MTurk samples compare to these approaches when employing strategies utilized by each (e.g., weighting the sample to be representative of the general population).
Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that crowdsourcing methods are a viable strategy to recruit a PTE-exposed sample and facilitate collection of samples with clinically meaningful symptoms. This approach is especially useful as a means to collect large quantities of data in a brief time period with a limited budget. Such a strategy is optimal for collecting preliminary data for novel hypotheses in preparation for costly research. As with any method, the strengths of crowdsourced data collection should be considered in light of its limitations. Researchers must take additional, crowdsourcing-specific steps to ensure the quality of their data. When data validation practices are used, however, high quality data from hard-to-reach samples can be collected.
