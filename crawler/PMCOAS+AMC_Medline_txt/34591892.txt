District level correlates of COVID-19 pandemic in India during March-October 2020
Background
COVID-19 is affecting the entire population of India. Understanding district level correlates of the COVID-19’s infection ratio (IR) is essential for formulating policies and interventions.
Objective
The present study aims to investigate the district level variation in COVID-19 during March-October 2020. The present study also examines the association between India’s socioeconomic and demographic characteristics and the COVID-19 infection ratio at the district level.
Data and methods
We used publicly available crowdsourced district-level data on COVID-19 from March 14, 2020, to October 31, 2020. We identified hotspot and cold spot districts for COVID-19 cases and infection ratio. We have also carried out two sets of regression analysis to highlight the district level demographic, socioeconomic, household infrastructure facilities, and health-related correlates of the COVID-19 infection ratio.
Results
The results showed on October 31, 2020, the IR in India was 42.85 per hundred thousand population, with the highest in Kerala (259.63) and the lowest in Bihar (6.58). About 80 percent infected cases and 61 percent deaths were observed in nine states (Delhi, Gujarat, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana). Moran’s- I showed a positive yet poor spatial clustering in the COVID-19 IR over neighboring districts. Our regression analysis demonstrated that percent of 15–59 aged population, district population density, percent of the urban population, district-level testing ratio, and percent of stunted children were significantly and positively associated with the COVID-19 infection ratio. We also found that, with an increasing percentage of literacy, there is a lower infection ratio in Indian districts.
Conclusion
The COVID-19 infection ratio was found to be more rampant in districts with a higher working-age population, higher population density, a higher urban population, a higher testing ratio, and a higher level of stunted children. The study findings provide crucial information for policy discourse, emphasizing the vulnerability of the highly urbanized and densely populated areas.
Introduction
Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is a member of a large family of viruses called coronaviruses. These viruses can infect people and some animals. The virus is thought to spread from person to person through droplets released when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. With more than 81,82,676 confirmed cases on October 31, 2020, India ranked second globally in terms of the total number of infected patients of COVID-19. The rate of spread of the disease was slow in the initial three months (January to March 2020) from the first outbreak in Kerala in January 2020, possibly because of the early nationwide lockdown; widespread coverage about the pandemic in print, electronic and social media, and targeted efforts by the union and state governments on quarantine facilities and travel protocols. There was a paid increase in the number of confirmed COVID -19 cases in many districts since April 2020. India has recorded over 50,000 cases every day from August 2020. S1 Fig shows that the trend of COVID-19 confirmed cases bi-weekly from March 14- October 31, 2020. After reaching a peak of COVID-19 infection in September- October 2020, new cases have been steadily declining in India. This biweekly peak reduced from 12,44,430 (12–25 September, 2020) to 5, 97,281 (24 October- 5 November, 2020).
Interestingly, India has a relatively high recovery rate and the lowest fatality rate globally. Despite India’s advantage of having a young age structure with less susceptibility to COVID-19 related deaths, India may have to undergo a higher burden of disease due to other demographic factors such as the enormous population size, high population density, higher percentage of people living in poverty, lower levels of per capita public health infrastructure, and a high prevalence of co-morbid situations. Research evidence that the transmission of second wave of COVID- 19 increase risk almost double of the first peak. There is various factor associated with second wave more devasting such as–transmission dynamics, effect of population density, effect of testing rate and healthcare infrastructure.
Like any other health and demographic indicator, COVID-19 infection varies widely among the different states of the country. However, the geographical pattern of the COVID-19 infection rate’ does not coincide with the patterns of demographic and health indicators such as the under-five mortality rate or nutritional status. COVID-19 has been spreading rapidly in the urban areas, especially in states with megacities with densely populated urban slums like Delhi, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal. The sudden surge of return labour migration to the states of origin (due to COVID-19 related national lockdown), state-level health care system, adherence to physical distancing measures, and local government management are other potential community-level factors affecting geographical variations in the spread of COVID-19 in India. Some recent studies have computed composite indices to rank the districts in terms of their COVID-19 vulnerabilities using demographic information and infrastructure characteristics. While such analyses help district-level planning and prioritization, they are based on the assumption that vulnerability will decrease as the districts’ socioeconomic indicators improve. However, such an inverse relationship may not be applicable in the context of COVID-19; for instance, a higher percentage of the urban population may indicate a higher socioeconomic status of the district population in a non-COVID situation and may be linked with an improved health outcome. However, it may be positively correlated with the spread of COVID-19. COVID-19 is more prevalent in cities and towns than in rural areas or hilly regions. Therefore, it is imperative to unfold the empirical relationship patterns between the district’s socioeconomic and household infrastructural characteristics and the COVID-19 infection ratio.
To the best of our knowledge, no such previous study has been conducted on COVID-19 in India. The aim of the present study is of two-folds, first to investigate the district level variation in COVID-19 during March-October 2020 and, secondly, to investigate the district level socioeconomic and demographic correlates of COVID-19 infection ratio in India. Identification of such correlates is crucial for framing health policy and appropriate intervention.
Data and methods
We used crowdsourced district-level data on COVID-19 available in the public domain from March 14, 2020, to October 31, 2020, accessed from the COVID-19 India dashboard. The time-series data on COVID-19 was available in the COVID-19 India from March 14, 2020. It is an application programming interface (API) to monitor the COVID-19 cases at national, state, and district levels. The data compiled in this web portal is based on state bulletins and official handles. The details of the data are available on the website. This portal data is consistent with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare data, Government of India (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/).
For explanatory variables, we utilized data from the National Family Health Survey of India 2015–16 (NFHS-4), a cross-sectional survey of 601,599 households, and 2.87 million individuals from all 29 states and seven union territories. The survey collected data on various socioeconomic, demographic, health, and family planning indicators and anthropometry and biomarkers’ measures related to anemia, hypertension, and diabetes. The NFHS-4 is the most recent source of such biomarker-based data at the district level in India. We also used some socioeconomic and demographic variables from the Census of India.
Outcome variable
We have analyzed new, infected, recovered, and deceased cases at the national and state levels. The term "new cases" indicates the newly infected cases in the reference period; the term "confirmed cases" indicates the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the reference period. The recovered and deceased cases indicate the number of persons recovered and died from COVID-19 in the reference period. Finally, the term "average infected cases" means the total number of confirmed cases after excluding recovered and death cases.
For all the 640 districts in the thirty-five states and eight union territories of India, we defined the outcome variable, COVID-19 Infection Ratio (IR), as the number of confirmed cases in a given district per 100,000 population. For the district-level population for the year 2020, we projected the district population using an exponential growth rate from the census 2001 and 2011.
The infection of ratio was calculated as:  Where,
Ci = the number of confirmed cases in ith district and the Pi = total projected population in the ith district on October 31, 2020.
District level correlates
Based on previous literature, we considered a set of 23 variables at district level, viz., i) Demographic variables: percentage of population aged 60 and above, percentage of population in age group 15–59, percentage of marginal worker, population density, ii) Socioeconomic variables: percentage of the literate population, percentage of Scheduled Castes (SC) population, percentage of Scheduled Tribes (ST) population, percentage of Hindu population(as an indicator of religious composition at district level), percentage of urban population, average number of persons that sleep in one room; iii) Household Infrastructure variables: percentage of households with availability of soap, percentage of households with water and toilet facility within the premise; iv) Health-related variables: percentage of women with Diabetes (Glucose>140mg), percentage of women (among age18+) with Cancer, percentage of 18+ aged women consuming tobacco, testing ratio per one hundred thousand population, under-five mortality rate, percentage of institutional births, percentage of full immunization among children aged 23–36 months, percentage of women aged 18 and above reporting anemia and, percentage of children with stunting and wasting. The district’s health-related variables represent the district population’s overall health status at the macro level.
Statistical analysis
We performed a bi-weekly trend analysis of COVID-19 cases in India. To examine the district level correlates of the outcome variable, we carried out a linear regression analysis at the district level. Four separate district-level regression models were fitted—Model 1and Model 3 presents the independent variable’s unadjusted effect without controlling any other independent variable’s role. Model 2 and Model 4 show the adjusted results of the independent variables on the dependent variable. We did all the analyses in the statistical package Stata14.1. We tested for the possible multicollinearity among the independent variables before fitting them to the regression model.
Spatial analysis
For analysing the spatial distribution of the COVID-19 cases at the district level, we generated descriptive maps of 640 districts in the software package QGIS. We later exported the shapefiles to GeoDa software to perform spatial analysis. Using the first-order ’Queen’s contiguity matrix as the weight, we estimated Moran’s I and univariate Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA). ’Moran’s I" is the Pearson coefficient measure of spatial autocorrelation, which measures the degree to which data points are similar or dissimilar to their spatial neighbours. The LISA cluster map yields four types of geographical clustering of the interest variable.
Here, "high-high" refers to the regions with an above-average infection ratio and sharing the boundaries with neighbouring areas with above-average infection ratio values. On the other hand, "high-low" indicates regions with below-average value and the surrounding areas with an above-average infection ratio. Also, the areas with below-average infection rates and sharing boundaries with neighbouring regions having values below the average of the same variables are referred to as low-low. The "high-high" are also referred to as hot spots, whereas the "low-low" is referred to as cold spots.
Results
India has been reporting new cases of the coronavirus (COVID-19) every day since March 14, 2020. India reported over 8.1 million confirmed cases as of October 31, 2020. Out of these, around 7.4 million patients recovered, while 1 22,154 were fatal.
Fig 1 and S1 Table present the national bi-weekly (14 days) national pattern of new confirmed, infected, recovered, and deceased COVID-19 cases in India in the study period. In India, the average bi-weekly new confirmed cases rose 677 times (from 63 to 42,663), the average recovered points increased 10,729 times (from 5 to 53,647), the average infected patients increased 449 times (from 63 to 28,256). The average deceased cases increased 502 times (from 1 to 502) between the 1st and the 17h bi-weekly. During the study period, the COVID-19 cases were in peak 12th-25th September 2020, and then it started declining.

S2 Table presents national and state-wise confirmed, infected, recovered, and deceased cases for the entire study period (March 14, 2020, to October 31, 2020). It also presented infection ratios at the national and state level. It is found that six states viz. Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh, have accounted for more than half of the country’s total cases. About 70 percent of new possibilities, 70 percent of recovered cases, 80 percent of infected patients, and 61 percent of COVID-19 deaths are from only nine states (Maharashtra, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, West Bengal, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh). The IR in India is 42.85 per one hundred thousand people. The highest IR was observed in Kerala (259.93) and the lowest in Bihar (6.58). However, the states like Arunachal Pradesh (123.40), Delhi (165.13), Goa (152.21), Ladakh (223.89), Maharashtra (101.63), Manipur (121.58), and Puducherry (245.95) experienced a far higher level of infection ratio than the national average. Only two Union Territories, viz., Lakshadweep, and Daman & Diu, experienced zero cases during the study period.
District level variations in COVID-19
Panel A in Figs 2 and 3 showed the district-level variations in COVID-19 on July 31, 2020, and October 31, 2020, respectively. The size of the bubble in the figure indicates the number of positive COVID-19 cases in districts on these two time periods. The larger the size of the bubble, the higher is the number of confirmed cases. Of all districts, a shift in the number of cases could easily visible in districts ranking till July 31, 2020. Mumbai has the highest number of cases, while by the end of October 2020, Bengaluru Urban tops the confirmed cases. By the end of July 2020, five urban districts contain about 28 percent of the confirmed cases (Mumbai, 7.02 percent; Chennai, 6.13 percent; Thane, 5.73 percent; Pune, 5.48 percent and Bengaluru, 3.41 percent). However, a new pattern has been observed on October 31, 2020, when about 17 percent of the COVID-19 confirmed cases consists of five major districts (Bengaluru Urban: 4.25 percent; Pune: 4.22 percent; Mumbai:3.25 percent; Thane: 2.82 percent and Chennai: 2.52 percent). In July 2020, about 11 percent of the confirmed cases belonged to another seven urban districts (Hyderabad, Central Delhi, Ahmedabad, South East Delhi, Kolkata, West Delhi, and East Godavari) with at least 20,000 confirmed cases. However, by the end of October 31, 2020, seven districts contributed 9.34 percent of total cases, with at least 90,000 confirmed cases in each district. About 90 percent (575 districts) have at least 1000 confirmed cases each, and about 97 percent (625 districts) have at least 100 positive confirmed cases of COVID-19. About 99.5 percent of the districts reported at least one confirmed case of COVID-19 until October 31, 2020.

In Figs 2 and 3, panel B presents the district level infection ratio (IR), defined as the number of confirmed cases per 100,000 population on July 31, 2020, and October 31, 2020, respectively. The results show that the top three worst-affected districts (Central Delhi, New Delhi, Mumbai, and Chennai) in India have at least 2,000 (per 100,000 population). Another three districts, viz., South East Delhi, Kamrup Metropolitan, and North Delhi, have IR ranging between 1000 to 2000 per one hundred thousand population till the end of July 2020. However, by the October end, the same districts have experienced a manifold increase in IR (for instance, the IR in Kamrup Metropolitan increased from 1,035 to 77,044 per 100,000 population). On October 31, 2020, East Delhi, Kamrup Metropolitan, Jodhpur, Ranga Reddy, and Ajmer were the top five worst districts experiencing IR from 26,456 to 96,256 per one hundred thousand population. There were about eleven districts with an IR ranging between 11,780 and 24,806 per one hundred thousand people. These were Kolkata, Warangal, Central Delhi, Bengaluru Urban, Kannur, Kurnool, Fatehabad, Udupi, Madhubani, West Delhi Haridwar by October 31, 2020.
Fig 4 presented the Moran’s I and LISA cluster maps for the district infection ratio of COVID-19 in India for March 14, 2020- July 31, 2020, and March 14, 2020- October 31, 2020. Both maps represented a positive spatial clustering level (’Moran’s I value are 0.333 and 0.282 respectively) in the COVID-19 infection rate over neighbouring districts. Hotspots of COVID-19 were observed in the parts of Konkan coast of Maharashtra (Palghar, Mumbai, Thane, Nashik, and Satara); in the southern part from Tamil Nadu (Chennai, Chengalpattu, Thiruvallur, Virudhunagar, and Ramanathapuram); in Delhi; and in the northern part of Jammu & Kashmir (Ganderbal and Pulwama) whereas cold-spots were observed in central, north-western and north-eastern regions of India.

Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics of the outcome variable (Infection Ratio) and exposure variables for the 640 districts. The average infection ratio is (108.40 per one hundred thousand population on July 31, 2020, and 586.54 per one hundred thousand population on October 31, 2020. On July 31, 2020, the IR was zero in the two districts from Arunachal Pradesh (Dibang valley, Krumung Kumey) and another two districts from the Union Territories (Lakshadweep and Nicobar).

** Variables were computed from Census of India 2011; The rest of the explanatory variables were calculated from the fourth round of the National Family Health Survey.
All district-level socioeconomic variables differ substantially among districts. For example, the mean percent of the old age population (60 and above) is 8.33, and it varies between 2.46 percent to 17.82 percent among the districts of India. The percent of marginal worker a proxy indicator of district level out migration, ranged substantially from 1.36 to 33.60 percent. Population density (number of persons per square kilometer) varies from 1 in Dibang Valley (Arunachal Pradesh) to 36155in northeast Delhi.
We also observed massive variation in the districts’ socioeconomic variables, viz., percent Hindu, urban, and ST population vary from 0 percent to 100 percent in India’s districts. On average, 2.92 persons sleep in one room in the Indian districts. On average, 48.14 percent of the households have water facilities, and 61.41 percent have toilet facilities within the household premises. Hygiene practice of availability of soap ranges from less than 17.20 percent to 98.90 percent in India. There exists a wide disparity in health-related variables too. While the testing ratio ranged from 0 to11471 persons per 100 hundred thousand, the percentage of full immunization among children ranged from 7.14 to 100. The tobacco consumption among women ranged from 0.8 to 88 percent.
The regression analysis of infection ratio (presented in Table 2) displays both unadjusted and adjusted coefficients of the exploratory variables for two time periods, viz., March 14, 2020-July 31, 2020 and March 14, 2020-October 31, 2020. In the unadjusted models (1 & 3), among demographic variables, percent of 15–59 aged population, percent of marginal workers, and population density were significantly associated with IRs. Several socioeconomic variables, such as the literate population, ST population, and urban population, and the average person sleeping in a room were significantly associated in the unadjusted model 1.

1 All variables are computed at the district level.
Districts with higher levels of household infrastructure facilities (such as soap or toilet facility) reported higher levels of IRs in model 3. Among the health-related variables, percentage of women with diabetes (glucose > 140), testing ratio, institutional births, percentage of children immunized were significantly positively correlated with COVID-19 IR in October in the unadjusted model. Districts with high diabetic patients have a 21.05 and 89.8690-fold higher chance of COVID-19 infection in July and October than those with a low prevalence of diabetes. However, the percentage of women consuming tobacco, under-5 mortality, and children with stunting conditions were associated negatively with COVID-19 IR.
In the adjusted model (2 & 4), the association between IRs and most of the correlates becomes statistically insignificant. After controlling the roles of demographic, socio-economic, household facilities, and health-related variables in the adjusted model, percent of 15–59 aged population (model 2: 16.91, CI:5.27–28.55 vs model 4: 75.33, CI:39.71–111.74), district-level population density (model 2: 0.05, CI:0.04–0.06 vs model 4: 0.12, CI:0.09–0.15), and percent of urban population (model 2: 2.45, CI: 0.39, 4.51 vs model 4: 12.7, CI: 6.37–19.04).) were positively significantly associated with the district infection ratio at district level. Thus, with an increasing percentage level of these variables at the district level, there was an increasing chance of COVID-19 infection ratio. As the districts’ literacy rate increases, the COVID-19 infection ratio also decreases in the adjusted models, but the relationship is statistically significant only in the infection ratio until October 31, 2020 (model 4: -12.84, CI:27.86, 2.18).
In the adjusted models, none of the infrastructure variables were significantly related to the spread of virus. However, among the health-related variables the district-level, testing ratio (model 2: 0.03, CI: 0.01–0.04 vs. model 4: 0.03, CI: 0.02–0.04) and child stunting (model 2: 4.46, CI: -0.04–8.96 vs. model 4: 12.12, CI: -1.62–25.86) was significantly and positively associated with the prevalence of effective in containing the COVID-19 virus.
Summary and discussion
In terms of the total number of confirmed cases, India ranked second after the US, reporting more than eight million COVID-19 cases as of October 31, 2020. The present study examined the district-level variation in COVID-19 cases from March 14, 2020, to October 31, 2020. The present study also aimed to identify socioeconomic and demographic correlates of COVID-19 infection ratio at the district level. Due to different stages of socio-economic development in the states, the trajectory of COVID-19 and related intervention cannot be uniform. Our result illustrated the differences in COVID-19 cases at the state and district levels with few critical findings.
First, the spread of COVID-19 has been increasing over time during the study period. The average bi-weekly cases show that the new, infected, recovered, and deceased cases are growing nationally. It is found that about 80 percent of the infected patient and 61 percent of the deaths are concentrated in nine states (Delhi, Gujarat, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana). On October 31, 2020, the IR in India was 42.85 per hundred thousand population. The IR ranged from a minimum of 6.58 in Bihar to a maximum of 259.63 in Kerala. Only two Union Territories (Lakshadweep and Daman & Diu) have zero IR. The metropolitan cities like New Delhi, Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Kamrup Metropolitan, South Goa, Chennai, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad were most affected by COVID-19. The study identifies the districts at higher risk of coronavirus infection in the southern, northern, and western states. The apparent concern is that these states also contribute significantly to the Indian economy. Another important observation of this study is that districts bordering the six metropolitan cities were observed to be India’s highest hot spots, possibly because they contribute the largest share of migrants and commuters to these megacities.
Spatial autocorrelation analysis of COVID-19 infection ratio shows that a district’s infection ratio is not highly correlated with that of the neighboring districts. We have observed a few hotspots of COVID-19 in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, and Jammu &Kashmir. In contrast, we identified cold-spots in the central, north-western and north-eastern regions of India.
Finally, our research reveals that the district’s infection ratio of COVID-19 is correlated with most socioeconomic and health-related variables. However, after adjusting other variables’ roles, we observed a statistically significant association only with a limited number of variables. After adjusting the role of socioeconomic and health-related factors, the COVID-19 infection ratio was found to be higher in districts with a higher working-age population, higher population density, a higher urban population, a higher testing ratio, and a higher level of stunted children.
The results obtained in regression analysis are consistent with that from the geographical analysis of the Covid-19 infection ratio. It has been observed that highly urbanized districts are worst affected by Covid-19. Population density is also higher in urban areas compared to rural areas. As the percentage of the urban population increases, the chances of unavoidable economic activities such as medicine, food transport, distribution, etc., also increase even in the national lockdown period, which exposes more people to the pandemic. Previous studies also showed that higher population densities in congested slum areas and large towns accelerated COVID-19 infection and mortality rates. The congestion, slum concentrations, inadequate housing, and sanitation in poor urban areas may explain such high disease. A positive association between COVID-19, IRs, and testing ratio indicates underreporting of COVID-19 in districts where the testing ratio is low.
Studies based on individual data show that older people are more vulnerable to COVID-19 infections. This study also identified that pre-existing diabetes is positively associated with COVID-19 disease. In our research, we did not find such associations since our analysis is not an individual-level analysis. One of the major limitations of our study is not extending the analysis beyond October 31, 2020. However, this analysis can be extended in future. Yet, unlike many previous studies, we are identifying macro-level correlates of the COVID-19 infection rate for the period March 14, 2020, to October 31, 2020.
Comparison between first and second waves of COVID-19 in India
At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, India imposed world’s strictest nationwide lockdown beginning from March 25, 2020, But, as of April 10, 2021, India was the third leading country after USA and Brazil’s identified cases. Like several other parts of the world, India has been experiencing a massive surge of COVID-19 cases and deaths. The second wave has started in the middle of March, 2021 and recorded highest number of cases (144,829) on April 09, 2021. The major affected states were Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. Moreover, several megacities with high concentration of population and overcrowded with migrants registered high transmission rate of the disease. Mumbai Urban and NCT of Delhi were the example of two such cities. Despite this high caseload, several national movements such as the farmer’s protest in November 2020 at the New Delhi border, elections in several states and some religious gatherings have kept the social distancing norms at stake and made situation highly vulnerable for the spread of the virus. Another reason for the high spread of virus might be the intra-urban mobility form slum to towns/cities. The household density of the slum areas is one of the most vital causes of the infection spread. The international airports of NCT of Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Kolkata acted as the gateways to allow the dangerous mutating COVID-19 strain to spread across the main urban hubs of the country. Moreover, migrant labors also borrow the new strain to the different corners of the country. We also found that previous studies on second wave, have similar pattern of hotspots clusters with as our study. The concentration of the virus spread basically found in Mumbai Urban -Pune-Nasik-Kolhapur region and NCT of Delhi (comprising Punjab and Haryana). Though Kerala and districts surroundings Bengaluru Urban have high concentration of confirmed cases, it didn’t report high CFR. These patterns would give us some idea to combat with the present situation and get prepared for the predicted third wave.
Conclusion
The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have a long-term impact on health, economy, and social processes globally, including India. Only a clear understanding of the disease’s spatial distribution and its correlates will help to formulate policies and interventions. Therefore, the possible risk factors should be included in policy preparedness and implementation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding risk factors of COVID-19 may also help to understand the future dynamics of COVID-19 or other such infectious diseases.
We found that the share of working-age populations, population density, urban residence, and testing rates are significantly correlated with the COVID-19 infection ratio (IR). As in urban areas, the population density is very high, and social distancing is challenging to maintain; the role of government is crucial in combating the pandemic. By ensuring the health and hygiene-related facilities, (providing adequate clean water, adequate sanitation, and sewerage facilities, cleaning the city, maintaining quarantine centers and public health care institutions, etc.), and improving public distribution system to ensure minimum food supply, especially among the urban poor and other deprived sub-groups, can help to control the spread of COVID-19 infection.
More tests are required to classify patients with asymptomatic conditions. India has a population of over 1.3 billion, but till October 31, 2020, approximately 1087.9 million (only 8.04 percent) tests have been carried out. As of April 1, 2021, India has 552,566 active infection cases while 11,434,301 patients have recovered and 162,468 have succumbed to COVID-19. According to Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, a total of about 640.05 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered by August 31, 2021. Simultaneously, people’s negligent behavior towards COVID-19 protocols (like, not following the social distancing norms, not wearing the mask in public places, and coughing without covering mouth) put them at a higher risk. Finally, there is a need to improve infrastructure (hospitals, ventilators, PPE kits) and human resources (doctors, nurses, and frontline workers) in healthcare facilities.
Our analysis does have a few limitations. First, there is a possibility of under-reporting positive and fatal cases due to a lack of testing or social stigma. Hence our data gives the most conservative estimates of the infection ratio. Second, for most cases, the patients’ level of information (such as age, sex, and comorbidity) is unavailable. Therefore, we analyzed the district-level determinants instead of individual-level determinants. Thus, our results identified the major correlates only at the district level. Finally, we analyzed the number of confirmed cases for infection ratio rather than the number of active cases. The later considers the recovery rate and depends on the health service available in a region. We used the number of confirmed cases as the primary indicator of the spread of the infection. Despite these limitations, the study’s merit lies in bringing together spatial-demographic vulnerabilities prevalent across the nation during the pandemic period.

Reviewer #1: Thank you for the opportunity to review this manuscript on a very topical issue. The overall idea, writing style and intent is good . The concerns regarding the study itself are however as below:
1. The study analyses data between march to July 2020 and therefore the timeliness of the publication and its findings itself may not resonate with the reader. Apart from the fact that things have changed since this study was done, the pandemic is now on the decline and in reality, widely prevalent in states like Kerala which did not need mention early in the pandemic given the State did so well.
2. It may be pertinent to revisit the timeline and consider maybe an analysis atleast till the start of the winter months to make this a more relevant piece today.
3. The use of open source data , including NFHS is a good step, but NFHS data from next round too is now available.
4. rather than only using above 60 age group, considering the middle age-groups - the working age groups may have also helped give important insights.
5. The Sociodemographic variables did not include one on household income or occupation, while education may have filled some of that gap but skewed the findings.
6. I was intrigued too by the selection of health indicators- fasting glucose , use of tobacco etc for women? Would this not under-represent prevalence across males of important co-variates like smoking? The access to healthcare is another important variable besides the consideration of pre-existing respiratory illness. A lot of selected variables related to immunisation and childhood illness and health indicators while this age group was largely the unaffected age group in the pandemic.
7.Line 283 - has an important spell edit - in terms of CoVID-19 protocols- not wearing the mask in pubic place to be edited to public place!
8. The overall intention of district-level correlates determining oVID-19 and feeding policy and management of the pandemic will be well-served if the right variables are selected for the analyses, and over a longer time window to help district-level planning and management.
9. Use of the infection ration is welcome but the correlates and determinants need addressing...
10. Thank you for the clear and succinct writing style but do revisit some of the points addressed above.
Reviewer #2: The study on “District level correlates of COVID-19 pandemic in India” about exploring the hot and cold spots in terms of districts and finding the socio-economic, demographic and health-related determinants of COVID-19 disease in India. The study uses publicly available data from COVID19 India API. The study uses descriptive statistics of COVID-19 disease and linear regression model using indicators from NFHS-4 and Census of India to establish the findings. The outcomes of the study are based on three major findings from: (a) trend analysis of COVID-19 cases, (b) infection ratio (hot and cold spots) and Moran’s Index and (c) determinants based on regression.
The study needs to give attention to these corrections:
Main comments:
1) The Introduction section, Summary and Discussion, and Conclusion section need to be strengthened. Introduction section may be well connected with the other sections of the manuscript.
2) Trend analysis, infection ratio, hot and cold spots, and regression results are interpreted independently. Trend analysis may be interpreted for its plausible role of the concentration of COVID-19 cases in a few districts of India and infection ratio. Authors may explain what are the implications of manifold rise of recovery rates until July 2020 on the infection ratio or the implications of increase of average deceased cases by 734 times during studied period.
3) A large focus is given to explaining unadjusted beta coefficients from the results of regression model. Rather, the adjusted figures may be given more writing space. Independent variables are in percent in the linear regression model. Understanding that, the variables effects are interpreted in terms of levels. The interpretation of Table 2 may be revised.
4) In Table 2, authors may check the significance values and the respective confidence interval for unadjusted coefficients. These may be serious errors.
5) The manuscript may conclude strongly about the four determinants connecting it with the trend analysis, infection ratio and hot and cold spots.
6) The manuscript needs an English language editing and flow may be maintained.
Minor comments:
A) In abstract section, (1) the full form of COVID-19 disease may be written correctly, (2) whether authors have used prevalence rate from the crowdsourced data? (3) authors may specific reasons for using data from 14 March 2020, (4) authors may mention crucial information for policy discourse in the conclusion.
B) In Introduction section, (1) line no. 4-6: authors please check the sentence and growth rate of COVID-19 disease in the first three months from Jan to Mar 2020 perhaps, (2) line no. 8-10: check for definite measures, the reduction in doubling time is not apparent from Fig S1, and the second part of the same sentence is contradictory to the first part, (3) line no. 18-19: adults being less susceptible to disease compared to older is based on some assumptions, (4) line no. 22-23: Co-morbid situations are important but reference is missing, (5) line no. 26-27: under-five mortality and nutritional status children may not be associated with the spread of disease.
C) In Outcome variable section, (1) line no. 72, authors check formula.
D) In Spatial Analysis section, (1) line no. 111: description of “low-low” is not given in text.
E) In Result section, (1) line no. 114: authors may check the source used for data if they wish to write “every day since”, (2) line no. 116: Fig S2 and Table S1 provide the same results, (3) line no. 118-121: based on average bi-weekly and base numbers, authors may choose a different growth rate, also Table A1 is not found in text, (4) line no. 129-130: per one hundred thousand versus 100 thousand, authors may use same wording, (5) line no. 146-147: how one confirmed case and positive case are different? (6) line no. 193-194: the interpretation of likelihood in case of linear regression results, (7) line no. 195: which levels of infrastructure has higher effects is not clear from text and Table 2.
F) In Summary and Discussion section, (1) line no. 213: if demographic transition is an appropriate reason, then assumption need to be mentioned in this manuscript, (2) line no. 249: undefined term “unavoidable economic activities”, (3) line no. 259: study design may not be appropriate reason for not explaining co-morbidities in association with disease.
G) In Conclusion section, (1) line no. 267: understanding of disease only by Spatial distribution and its determinants is not supported by the analysis.

Reviewer #2: The study on “District level correlates of COVID-19 pandemic in India” about exploring the hot and cold spots in terms of districts and finding the socio-economic, demographic and health-related determinants of COVID-19 disease in India has remained more or less at the same position.
Authors may consider these suggestions for future works.
1) The result section is crowded with minor small descriptions such as data description of recovery rates, death rates, which is nowhere connected with any succeeding results, state level and then district level infection ratios, and then again descriptive statistics as shown in Table 1 from which standard deviation for many considered variables are described.
2) The regression results are very poorly summarised. Researchers have ignored the importance of adjusted over unadjusted models. The results clearly warn through the change in P values and coefficients while showing the case of unadjusted and adjusted models. It is percent population in 15-59 years, population density, % urban population, testing, and stunting which are outcomes from regression analysis but not adequately explained in result as well as discussion section of the manuscript.
3) The introduction should be updated with more evidences from the works of literature. The transmission rate of virus of COVID-19 disease is higher during initial times whereas authors have considered it slow based on some works of literature. The widespread of media coverage are not supported by good references. These are controversial and dithering statements given the pandemic.
4) Authors have not taken the numbers and its interpretation seriously. There is ignorance on the part of authors.
5) The term bi-weekly is cumulative or point COVID-19 cases, it is not clear in the text. The bi-weekly numbers of 11 lakhs are shown in Appendix S1 which reveals the bi-weekly peak, as terminology used by authors, was 1244430 in the next week in contrast to the previous week mentioned in text. The Figure 1 and Table S1 shows average numbers; this bi-weekly peak/number is not a meaningful description when original COVID19 data from the API itself provides a more robust measurement.
6) The percent of women whose husbands are away for the last six months is taken as the proxy of out-migration but not taken as one of the variables in analysis. However, percent of marginal workers is considered with the same max and min values of that variable as explained in text.
7) Again, ‘positive (absolute values)’ wording is used in the panel A in Fig 2 and 3. Legends of the maps shown in Fig 2 are inconsistent with Fig 3.
8) The write-up needs to be much more scientific and richer in content which is lacking throughout.
Reviewer #3: The study is important, interesting and generally well written. I have some small recommendations which should be addressedbefore it can be published.
Comments:
1. This study clearly states that it's analysis focuses on the months between July and October 2020. Clearly the covid-19 pandemic is ever-changing and India is clearly in the midst of a catastrophic second wave. The authors have clearly put much effort into their paper so to expect them to include data beyond October 2020 is unreasonable. Instead, the authors should provide a comparison between the first and second waves in their discussion - perhaps comparing case numbers in districts during the first wave to the second? Perhaps discussing which of the factors discussed in this paper may have contirbuted to this devastating second wave?
2. As with a fellow reviewer I'm confused by the use of health related variables focussing only on women (% women with diabetes, % women with cancer, % women consuming tobacco etc). As men are at greater risk of covid-19 why have they been excluded from these analyses? Why also are socioeconomic variables such as religion (% hindu) used? There may be good reasons for this, however the manuscript would benefit from the explanation of such reasons.
3. The manuscript makes no mention of the causative agent of covid-19, SARS-CoV-2. At least one sentence explaining that SARS-CoV-2 is the virus whilst covid-19 is the disease cuased by the virus. Furthermore, the authors must make an effort to discriminate SARS-CoV-2 and covid-19 when discussing spread. For instance, the authors says "COVID-19 has been spreading rapidly in the urban areas". This is inaccurate, SARS-CoV-2 has been spreading.

The study on “District level correlates of COVID-19 pandemic in India” about exploring the hot and cold spots in terms of districts and finding the socio-economic, demographic and health-related determinants of COVID-19 disease in India has remained more or less at the same position.
Reviewer comments:
Authors may consider these suggestions for future works.
The result section is crowded with minor small descriptions such as data description of recovery rates, death rates, which is nowhere connected with any succeeding results, state level and then district level infection ratios, and then again descriptive statistics as shown in Table 1 from which basic statistics for many considered variables are described.
Response – Thank you. We agree with the reviewer that we have done sufficient analysis to explore district level COVID-19 pattern. Therefore, we have modified our objective (Line 116-118). We kept the national level analysis (Figure 1) as background information. The state level analysis is presented only in the appendix with a short description of these results in line number 216-228.
The regression results are very poorly summarised. Researchers have ignored the importance of adjusted over unadjusted models. The results clearly warn through the change in P values and coefficients while showing the case of unadjusted and adjusted models. It is percent population in 15-59 years, population density, % urban population, testing, and stunting which are outcomes from regression analysis but not adequately explained in result as well as discussion section of the manuscript.
Response – We have updated regression results (the unadjusted model in the line number 308-325 and then the adjusted model from 326 to 341 of the manuscript. All the significant variables were explained adequately in the revised manuscript.
The introduction should be updated with more evidences from the works of literature. The transmission rate of virus of COVID-19 disease is higher during initial times whereas authors have considered it slow based on some works of literature. The widespread of media coverage are not supported by good references. These are controversial and dithering statements given the pandemic.
Response – We have updated the introduction section. We have not refered any media article; we rather refered articles by researchers. Due to nation-wide lockdown, the transmission rate was slow at the beginning of COVID19 in India. We have also included some good references.
Authors have not taken the numbers and its interpretation seriously. There is ignorance on the part of authors.
Response – We have revised the write-up in the revised draft.
The term bi-weekly is cumulative or point COVID-19 cases, it is not clear in the text. The bi-weekly numbers of 11 lakhs are shown in Appendix S1 which reveals the bi-weekly peak, as terminology used by authors, was 1244430 in the next week in contrast to the previous week mentioned in text. The Figure 1 and Table S1 shows average numbers; this bi-weekly peak/number is not a meaningful description when original COVID19 data from the API itself provides a more robust measurement.
Response – The term bi-weekly is non-cumulative. The number is correct and text was modified accordingly. The numbers have been revised in the text (line number 83-85 of the manuscript). The term bi-weekly in Figure 1 and Table S1 was not cumulative cases. It showed the average number of cases per 14 days. We showed 14 days average cases as when we present per each day, it becomes relatively cumbersome.
The percent of women whose husbands are away for the last six months is taken as the proxy of out-migration but not taken as one of the variables in analysis. However, percent of marginal workers is considered with the same max and min values of that variable as explained in text.
Response – We have removed the proxy of out-migration variable (the percent of women whose husbands are away for the last six months) from tables and text as it has not been included in regression analysis.
Again, ‘positive (absolute values)’ wording is used in the panel A in Fig 2 and 3. Legends of the maps shown in Fig 2 are inconsistent with Fig 3.
Response – We have revised this legend by “COVID19 Confirmed” and used the “Absolute number of COVID-19 cases” in panel A of both Figure 2 & 3.
The write-up needs to be much more scientific and richer in content which is lacking throughout.
Response: We have modified the write-up.
Reviewer #3: The study is important, interesting and generally well written. I have some small recommendations which should be addressed before it can be published.
Comments
1. This study clearly states that its analysis focuses on the months between July and October 2020. Clearly the covid-19 pandemic is ever-changing and India is clearly in the midst of a catastrophic second wave. The authors have clearly put much effort into their paper so to expect them to include data beyond October 2020 is unreasonable. Instead, the authors should provide a comparison between the first and second waves in their discussion - perhaps comparing case numbers in districts during the first wave to the second? Perhaps discussing which of the factors discussed in this paper may have contributed to this devastating second wave?
Response If we discuss first and second wave of COVID-19 together, we need to discuss it based on analysis, speculations will not be a good strategy. However, adding new analysis for the second wave in this study is beyond the scope of the paper. Covid-19 situation has been ever changing, and hence we want to restrict our analysis within the first wave.
Yet, as per reviewer’s suggestion, we compared the situation in the second wave as a part of discussion (Line number 402-424 of the manuscript).
2. As with a fellow reviewer I'm confused by the use of health-related variables focussing only on women (% women with diabetes, % women with cancer, % women consuming tobacco etc). As men are at greater risk of covid-19 why have they been excluded from these analyses? Why also are socioeconomic variables such as religion (% Hindu) used? There may be good reasons for this, however the manuscript would benefit from the explanation of such reasons.
Response – The design of the regression analysis presented here is not an individual level of analysis, rather a group level (district level analysis. Our independent variables are taken at macro level (i.e., district level) to determine overall health status and health care service utilization status. Therefore, fasting glucose or use of tobacco among women is representation to the overall health status of total population of the district. Similarly, immunization and childhood illness are taken to represent overall health status and health care service utilization. Percent of Hindu population is used as an indicator of majority population (which indirectly reflect the presence of minority population) at district level.
3. The manuscript makes no mention of the causative agent of covid-19, SARS-CoV-2. At least one sentence explaining that SARS-CoV-2 is the virus whilst covid-19 is the disease caused by the virus. Furthermore, the authors must make an effort to discriminate SARS-CoV-2 and covid-19 when discussing spread. For instance, the authors say "COVID-19 has been spreading rapidly in the urban areas". This is inaccurate, SARS-CoV-2 has been spreading.
Response – We have mentioned SARS-CoV-2 in the introductory part of the revised manuscript (Line no. 70-73
