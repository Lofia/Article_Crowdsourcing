Community Perspectives on Difference of Sex Development (DSD) Diagnoses: a Crowdsourced Survey
INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES:
Differences of sex development (DSD) engender ethical, social and psychosexual complexities that can complicate medical decision-making. We performed a web-based pilot study to estimate the utility value of a DSD diagnosis and to identify community concerns regarding DSD management.
METHODS:
A cross-sectional survey was posted on Amazon′s Mechanical Turk, an online crowdsourcing platform. Respondents were ≥18y and were randomized to receive information on one of three common DSD conditions: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH), Mixed Gonadal Dysgenesis (MGD), and Partial Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (PAIS). Time trade-off methodology was used to estimate utility values. Likert scale and statement-ranking questions were used to assess respondent perceptions.
RESULTS:
Of 1,628 respondents, median age was 34y; most respondents were parents (59.1%), white (77.1%), and previously unfamiliar with DSD (60.4%). The median overall utility value was 0.70 (IQR 0.50–0.90), similar to moderately severe chronic health conditions. Utility estimates varied based on the DSD scenario presented (0.80 CAH vs. 0.70 MGD vs. 0.80 PAIS, p = 0.0006), respondent gender (p<0.0001), race (p=0.002), religion (p=0.005), and prior knowledge of DSD (p<0.0001). Reported concerns included gender identity (23.4%), urinary function (20.5%) and surgical complications (17.4%). Most (67.5%) supported early surgical intervention at 6–18 mo; 10.4% thought surgery should occur ≥18y.
COMMENT:
Limitations of this study include that survey participants were aware of the nature of the study, thus some respondents may have participated to skew the results. Given the nature of this pilot study, the representation of families with children with DSD within the study is severely limited given the rarity of DSDs. This means that their opinions may be diluted by the large sample size. However, because utility values are classically estimated according to community opinions, the utility data presented should be taken to reflect that of the specific sample studied and is not reflective of that of families with a vested interest in such cases.
CONCLUSIONS:
Community-based respondents perceived that DSD conditions were associated with a reduction in utility values (0.70–0.80), on par with moderately severe chronic health conditions. Estimates varied based on respondents’ gender, race, religion and prior knowledge of DSD. Gender identity was the most concerning aspect for respondents.
Introduction
Differences (or disorders) of sex development (DSD) are a diverse group of diagnoses which typically result in ambiguous or discordant genital appearance; some patients with DSD are at increased risk for developing malignancies and/or sub- or infertility. A DSD diagnosis carries myriad ethical, social and psychosexual complexities that can complicate medical decision-making, especially concerning whether and when to perform surgical interventions. There is increasing recognition of a need for multi-disciplinary studies that tangibly define the impact of a DSD diagnosis on families and communities and that provide input on DSD from a wide range of voices.
One way to estimate the impact of a complex diagnosis on patients and families is to estimate a surrogate numerical value for quality of life known as a “utility value”. Utility values are defined as a number that quantifies the impact of a health state on the person’s overall well-being; 1 represents perfect health while 0 represents death. More severe conditions have lower values, such as a stroke (0.26); less severe condition are closer to 1, such as mild asthma (0.99) (Supplementary Table 1). Utility values are linear constructs, so the quality of life of someone with a utility of 0.5 is assumed to be exactly half that of someone with a utility of 1. Reliable utility values are crucial components of cost-effectiveness analyses; as a result, current recommendations are to calculate these at the societal level based on community input rather than those directly affected by the condition. Hence, utility values will often, by design, reflect underlying community perceptions and biases.
Thus, the main objective of this pilot study was to measure the impact of DSD on communities via a national survey. In order to calculate these values, we used a well-accepted methodology known as Time Trade-Off (TTO). We used two different versions of this methodology in order to test the consistency of the utility values obtained.
The purpose of our analysis is to generate hypotheses, to report descriptive statistics, and to provide an early estimate of utility values for DSDs, paying particular attention to the factors which could influence those utility values. Additionally, we elicited the community’s opinions on DSD diagnoses and treatments, including their opinion of the best time for surgical intervention if they were to have a child with a DSD diagnosis.
Methods
Study Design
A cross-sectional survey study was conducted amongst the general public to elicit utility values for DSD in a generic 6-year-old child. A Time-trade-off (TTO) approach was used to determine utility values. We used Amazon.com’s ‘Mechanical Turk’ (MTurk, www.mturk.com). This platform serves as a crowdsourcing digital marketplace, allowing ready access to a large, stable, diverse, and validated sample of American adults. Each worker is assigned an ID number, preventing task repetition. Participation in MTurk tasks is typically compensated at a rate of $0.05–$1.00; we set our payment to $1. This is commensurate with the compensation rate for similar MTurk tasks. Because all payments were made through an intermediary (Amazon.com), study participants remained strictly anonymous. Exclusion criteria included residence outside the United States, age < 18 years, and lack of English fluency. Utility values are classically estimated based on the perspectives of the community rather than only those affected by a condition, thus participants were included even if they were unfamiliar with DSDs, did not have children, or were not married. Respondents were specifically asked about their familiarity with DSD and whether they or a family member had a DSD. The survey then randomized participants to descriptions of one of three common DSD conditions: CAH, MGD, or PAIS.
Two attention checks were used to exclude inadequate responses. First, respondents were asked to select the phrase “Fairly Interested” from a list of options; 162 did not select this option and were removed. Second, respondents were asked for their age in years at the beginning and end of the survey; 488 respondents with mismatching ages were removed.
Survey Instrument
The first part of the survey questionnaire contains demographic questions and a TTO assessment of DSD health state utility. After completing the assigned (one of three possible) DSD-related passage, each participant was asked their perceived effect of DSD on themselves, their child, and on their family. Participants were asked hypothetically about what quantity of life they would be willing to trade to get their child back to perfect health. They were asked this sequentially in two different ways, or versions, of the TTO method as described below. This was done to check for consistency in eliciting TTO in different ways. The remainder of the survey focused on concerns related to a DSD diagnosis. Respondents were asked a series of Likert scale questions and had to reorganize a list of common concerns related to a DSD diagnosis in order in which those concerns mattered to the participant, from most to least important. At the end of the survey, participants were also asked at what age they thought surgical intervention in a DSD condition, if necessary, was appropriate.
Time trade-off version 1
In the first version of the TTO, survey participants were asked to imagine that a fortuneteller could accurately predict that they and their hypothetical six-year-old child with a DSD condition have at most ten years left to live. Participants were then presented a series of TTO scenarios with the aim of evaluating the number of healthy years they would be willing to give up in order to not live 10 years with a DSD. Utility was then derived as the hypothetical child’s number of healthy years left to live (selected by the survey participant) divided by ten years with a DSD condition. Utility was defined as follows:
Time trade-off version 2
In this second version, participants were asked whether they were willing to trade off years from the end of their combined dyadic life (both parent & hypothetical child). Specifically, combined life years was defined as the survey participant’s remaining years of life (this was calculated based on the participants’ current entered age at the time of survey and based on the Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC) 2013 life tables) + their hypothetical six-year-old child’s remaining years of life. Survey participants were then asked how many of these combined remaining life-years they would give up to never have their child be diagnosed with a DSD at birth. We then used the formula to define combined life year utility:
Statistical Methods
Data were summarized with mean (SD)/median (IQR) for continuous variables and N (%) for categorical variables. Bivariate associations were assessed using Kruskal-Wallis or Pearson’s correlation tests as indicated. For the main analysis of determining factors that were predictive of respondents’ utility estimates, univariate comparisons were first conducted and examined with a Bonferroni adjusted significance level of 0.003. Next, a forward selection procedure was run on 10,000 bootstrapped samples of complete data (i.e. respondents who answered all questions). Of the 1,628 observations, there were 1,617 complete cases. Variables were selected into the model which led to the greatest reduction in BIC. Reported are the proportion of times each variable was selected into one of the 10,000 final models. Analyses were conducted with SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC) and R Studio.
Results:
Survey Participant Demographics & Characteristics (Table 1)
The median age of survey participants was 34 years (IQR 28–43); 59.4% were female; and 58.9% were in a long-term relationship with a spouse or partner. Most were parents (59.1%), and of those 30.4% had at least one child under six years old. Most were white (77.1%) and about half were Christian (49.0%). When asked about prior knowledge of DSD, 85.4% of respondents said they had “none to minimal.”
Utility estimate using TTO version 1
The median utility value for DSD was 0.70 (IQR 0.50 – 0.90). There was sufficient evidence to suggest that utility was not equal across the three conditions, as respondents who answered questions about Mixed Gonadal Dysgenesis (MGD) described the median quality of life with DSD as slightly lower than the other two conditions (0.80 CAH vs. 0.70 MGD vs. 0.80 PAIS, p = 0.0006).
Overall, the majority of participants reported a utility above 0.5 with 28.4 % of participants reported a utility value of 0.5 or below. Of the 1,628 respondents, over 36.4% gave DSD a utility value of 0.9 or above.
Utility estimate using TTO version 2
The combined utility, determined from estimating the number of combined life-years remaining for the survey participant and their hypothetical six-year-old child, yielded slightly higher estimates of quality of life (median 0.88, IQR 0.77–0.94). The median percent of life- years to be donated from the parent as opposed to the child was 100% for all three surveys.
Predictors of Utility
None of the continuous covariates show evidence of a non-zero correlation with utility based on our adjusted significance level of 0.003. However, there is evidence to suggest that gender of respondent is associated with utility response (Female median 0.80 (IQR 0.50–0.90) vs. male median 0.70 (IQR 0.50–0.90) vs. Other/prefer not to say median 0.90 (IQR 0.83–0.90), p < 0.0001). There is also evidence to suggest that median utility is different depending on survey participant’s race (p = 0.002). Not surprisingly, there is some evidence that shows utility values are different depending on religious affiliations (p = 0.005). Additionally, there is strong evidence to suggest that prior knowledge of the term “intersex” is associated with utility: those with moderate to ample knowledge with this term gave a median utility of 0.80 (IQR 0.60–0.90) while those with none to minimal knowledge reported a median utility of 0.70 (IQR 0.50–0.90, p < 0.0001).
Ranking the Top 10 Community Concerns Regarding DSD
The most common concern for a survey participant whose hypothetical child received a DSD diagnosis was gender identity, with 23.40% of survey participants listing this as their top concern (with overall mean rank of 4.48 (SD 2.71)) of 10 concerns. Urinary function was also a common concern, listed as the top concern by 20.52% of respondents (mean rank of 3.38 (SD 1.96)), as was potential for surgical complications, listed as the top concern by 17.44% of respondents (mean rank of 3.73 (SD 2.42)). Concerns regarding the opinion of others in the community towards the participants’ hypothetical child with a DSD had both the lowest frequency of being ranked first as well as a mean rank of 8.48 (SD 1.40) out of a possible 10.
Likert scale statements regarding DSD
In the Likert style portion of the questionnaire, the statements with which the most respondents ‘strongly agreed’ included the importance of successful surgical intervention (56.3%), followed by 49.9% for the importance of urinary function. The statement that garnered the most neutral response (26.0% of respondents) was the importance of correcting intersex conditions. About a quarter of respondents, or 24.6%, ‘strongly disagreed’ that others’ opinions of their child with DSD mattered. While 23.4% of respondents placed gender identity a rank of 1 when asked to order their concerns in the previous section, 29.8% regarded the gender with which their child ultimately identified as important.
Age of surgical intervention
The majority of respondents (67.5%) preferred that their child have surgical intervention at 6–18 months of age; 10.4% thought surgery should occur when the child is 18 years or older.
Discussion
To our knowledge, our study is the first to estimate median utility values of three common DSD diagnoses. These values are on par with other chronic medical conditions such as diabetes and severe seizure disorders. Despite being described as non-life-threatening, respondents gave MGD a lower utility value than CAH or PAIS (p=0.006). There did not appear to be any differences between the demographic characteristics between the groups of respondents to explain this discrepancy. MGD may be perceived as a harsher condition with a lower quality of life by the participants. Alternatively, the combined method of utility calculation (version 2), yielded slightly higher utility estimates (0.88) but demonstrated no significant difference in utility among the conditions (p=0.0667). This result serves to illustrate that there are potentially challenges to comparing utility values when they have been calculated by slightly different, albeit valid methods.
Additionally, we aimed to determine which covariates would be predictors of utility responses. None of the continuous covariates, including participants’ self-rated health, were correlated with utility. Univariate analysis revealed that respondent gender was associated with utility response; likewise, prior knowledge of the term “intersex” appears to play a role. These findings imply that those who are more familiar with the term “intersex” find DSD to be less of a burden. Likewise, religious affiliation affected respondent’s valuation of DSD, with those who did not identify with organized religion reporting higher utility values.
Our study also aimed to parse out the aspects of a DSD diagnosis that were most concerning to the study participants. Gender identity was most commonly cited, followed by urinary function and potential for surgical complication. Hence, we concur with published recommendations that gender should be addressed early and often during treatment discussions. In particular, the actual clinical situation for parents and patients with DSD clearly should involve more than a single clinical meeting. Several sessions over time, allowing for incorporation of new information, further consideration, and the building of trust between families and physicians is crucial. Clearly, the emotional impact in this hypothetical situation does not compare with reality, and we would remind clinicians that deliberation over time is an important aspect to practice in this population in particular. Anecdotally, several respondents commented on this aspect at the end of the survey, noting the religious, cultural, or societal stigma associated with DSD and gender dysphoria in particular. It was refreshing to see that a significant proportion of comments focused on the happiness of the child as being the most important guideline for their decision-making. This was closely mirrored on our questionnaire, with “What other people think” being the least-frequently cited concern.
Interestingly, most respondents (67.5%) supported performing surgery at a young age, 6–18 months. The next most common recommendation was 2–9 years, followed by “before puberty.” Only 10% of respondents thought surgery should occur when the child was of legal majority. Data on timing of surgery is currently mixed, with no clear evidence-based consensus. Therefore, we concur with established recommendations that the utmost care should be taken when partnering with families to suggest a time of intervention, specifically that a holistic approach to making these decisions be applied by with specialized expert teams and extensive counseling with families.
Limitations of our study include that survey participants were aware of the nature of the study, as it was advertised on mTurk; given the current debate surrounding this topic, it is possible that some respondents participated solely to skew the results. Of note, 650 participants did not pass the attention checks (and were excluded), while other participants who passed the attention checks and completed the survey more quickly than we would have anticipated (some in as little as 2 minutes). Thus, we cannot guarantee the quality of responses, although this is an expected limitation in any survey-based study. Given the nature of this pilot study, the representation of families with children with DSD within the study is severely limited given the rarity of DSDs. This means that their opinions, which are arguably the most important, may be diluted by the large sample size. At first glance, this may seem like an unusual choice of survey recipients; community members, after all, are unaffected by the condition. From a methodological perspective, the “societal perspective” or community members are typically held to be the gold standard for utility assessment surveys. This is based on the rationale that in a community-financed insurance payor system (such as in the US, Europe, and most of the developed world), it is the community who ultimately bears the economic consequences of deciding whether a condition should be a priority and merits treatment. This prioritization was formally codified by the 1996 Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine and subsequently reaffirmed by the 2016 Second Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine. Both noted that all cost-effectiveness analyses (and, by default, utility estimation studies to be used in cost-effectiveness studies) should report data based on a societal perspective. Thus, these utility data should be taken to reflect that of this specific community sample studied rather than reflecting the lived experiences of patients and families with DSD.
Conclusion
In this crowdsourced community sample, a DSD diagnosis was estimated to significantly reduce patient and family utility values on par with other moderately severe chronic health conditions. There was evidence to suggest an association between perceived DSD utility and respondents′ sex, race, religion, personal experience/knowledge of DSD, and to which DSD condition respondents were randomized. Based on these pilot data, these variables are important to consider in future DSD quality of life studies.
