This has increased interest in methods for leveraging crowds to scale data labeling efforts, and methods to learn from noisy crowd-sourced labels. The need to scale labeling is acute but particularly challenging in medical applications like pathology, due to the expertise required to generate quality labels and the limited availability of qualified experts. In this paper we investigate the application of Scalable Variational Gaussian Processes for Crowdsourcing (SVGPCR) in digital pathology. We compare SVGPCR with other crowdsourcing methods using a large multi-rater dataset where pathologists, pathology residents, and medical students annotated tissue regions breast cancer. Our study shows that SVGPCR is competitive with equivalent methods trained using gold-standard pathologist generated labels, and that SVGPCR meets or exceeds the performance of other crowdsourcing methods based on deep learning. We also show how SVGPCR can effectively learn the class-conditional reliabilities of individual annotators and demonstrate that Gaussian-process classifiers have comparable performance to similar deep learning methods. These results suggest that SVGPCR can meaningfully engage non-experts in pathology labeling tasks, and that the class-conditional reliabilities estimated by SVGPCR may assist in matching annotators to tasks where they perform well.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1566</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1579</offset><text>The amount of labeled data is one of the primary determinants of performance in machine learning applications, and the requirements of today’s data-hungry algorithms have increased interest in scaling data labeling processes. A crowdsourcing approach that engages a broad set of individuals in labeling has been shown effective in tasks where expertise is not required such as labeling images in general categories. In applications requiring expertise, sourcing labels from crowds is more challenging. Medical applications where labels are often assigned by expert diagnosticians with years of training are particularly difficult, but are arguably the applications where scaling is needed most due to the lack of availability of these experts and the clinical demands on their time. Crowdsourcing in these scenarios can introduce significant tradeoffs between label volume and quality. A more open process can generate more labels but may sacrifice quality. Engaging with more focused groups such as medical students that have some familiarity with the subject matter can improve quality and can enable some degree of vetting of participants.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2724</offset><text>Crowdsourced labeled data suffer from high label noise due to the different varying expertise degrees. One typical approach for obtaining reliable labeled data is the consensus, i.e., majority voting. However, in medical imaging, fixing/aggregating the noisy labels in a previous training step is not the best way. Instead, the best choice is to keep each annotation and model the expertise degree of each annotator. For example, weighting each annotation based on the annotator’s reliability achieves this purpose. Raykar et al. introduced a crowdsourcing model for classification with multiple annotators based on logistic regression. This crowdsourcing framework jointly learns a latent classifier and annotators’ reliability. This model was used for grading prostate cancer in tissue microarrays, where five different pathologists annotated each image. They estimated iteratively the classifier’s coefficients and the annotators’ reliability, following an Expectation–Maximization (EM) scheme. The logistic regression classifier overcame the inter-observer grading variability levels, and showed a good agreement with the participants. However, the flexibility of this model is limited, because it considers logistic regression as the latent classifier. An analogous crowdsourcing framework has been also used with more expressive classifiers such as deep neural networks. Gaussian processes were also introduced for crowdsourcing with sound results across different domains. These models are Bayesian and non-parametric, making them suitable to learn good models without the need for very large labeled datasets. Also, they provide an accurate estimation of the uncertainty in the predictions.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4433</offset><text>In the dataset we will use in this paper, a group of medical students, pathology residents, and pathologists were organized to label tissue regions in digital pathology images of breast cancer specimens. The average medical student may have some basic understanding of histology from their medical school coursework, but they will not have specific knowledge of histologic patterns in breast cancer. The varied experience of these participants was leveraged to optimize effort while preserving quality. Medical students performed the majority of labeling tasks under the supervision of residents and attending pathologists, and feedback was provided openly via a Slack communication channel to avoid answering redundant questions. This significantly improved the quality of work that was given final review by pathologists, minimizing their work and interventions. While this process was effective, it worked because there was prior knowledge of participant experience, and it still required significant involvement of pathologists. This study set a high standard for quality for compatibility with learning algorithms that may not tolerate label noise well. A more tolerant algorithm would allow relaxation of these standards, enabling engagement of a broader audience without prior knowledge of their experience, and would require less oversight and review of their work. An ideal learning algorithm would be able to estimate the strengths and weaknesses of an individual participant during labeling, and to assign them examples accordingly to maximize efficiency.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">41598_2021_90821_Fig1_HTML.jpg</infon><infon key="id">Fig1</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>6000</offset><text>Scalable variational Gaussian processes for crowdsourcing (SVGPCR) in digital pathology. (A) This paper uses classification of predominant tissue patterns in breast cancer to investigate how SVGPCR can be used in crowdsourcing annotations for digital pathology. (B) The data used in this paper originates from a study where participants delineated tissue regions to produce semantic segmentation annotations in a set of curated Regions of Interest (ROI) (see Fig. 2). SVGPCR enables a sparse study where most ROIs are not annotated by all participants. (C) To leverage SVGPCR in this application, we analyze patches from the annotated ROIs. Patches were selected where at least 50% of the pixels correspond to a single label. For each patch with a majority label  we used VGG16 to extract a 512-dimensional feature vector  for SVGPCR training. (D) In SVGPCR, the observed annotation  depends on the true label  and annotator reliability . The scalable variational Gaussian process (SVGP) classifier  is trained to predict the true label from the features .  and  are used to improve the scalability of training (in GP terminology, they are called inducing locations and inducing points respectively, see Details on the machine learning algorithm). (E) Given a test patch, the SVGP classifier  can be used to infer the true label , or combined with the reliability matrix of a specific annotator to infer how that annotator would label the patch.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7446</offset><text>In this paper we investigate how Scalable Gaussian Processes (SVGP) can learn from noisy crowdsourced labels in digital pathology applications (Fig. 1). We explore a previously developed technique, SVGP for Crowdsourcing (SVGPCR), that learns how to infer accurate labels by estimating class-conditional reliabilities for individual annotators. SVGPCR can learn these reliabilities from sparsely annotated datasets where each sample is labeled by only a subset of the annotators. The probabilistic modeling used by SVGPCR is described in detail in Methods. We applied SVGPCR to a dataset where practicing pathologists, pathology residents, and medical students annotated breast cancer tissue regions. Our experiments found that SVGPCR trained on the noisy labels from non-experts is competitive with an equivalent SVGP trained using gold-standard expert labels. We also demonstrate how the learned annotator reliabilities accurately capture the class-conditional performance of individual annotators. We describe limitations of this approach and discuss how these approaches could be used to improve data labeling in digital pathology applications in the future.

Our experiments combine annotations generated by experts (SP) and novice (NP) participants in a crowdsourcing study of breast cancer digital pathology images. (A) 161 regions of interest in 151 slides were selected for inclusion in the annotation study. 10 ROIs were selected as the Evaluation ROIs (red) and annotated by all participants. The remaining 151 ROIs were each assigned to individual annotators as Core ROIs (black). (B) Participants used a web-based interface to annotate a number of tissue regions in each ROI including tumor, stroma, immune infiltration, and others. Core ROIs annotated by NPs were reviewed and corrected independently by either SPs, giving us paired uncorrected (black) and corrected gold standard (gray-filled) annotations. Annotations on Evaluation ROIs did not undergo correction. (C) We formed a number of training sets to assess various conditions. A “majority vote” (MV) training set smooths the labels over the evaluation set ROIs for assessing non-crowdsourcing methods. These are combined with the uncorrected core ROI annotations to increase data volume. A “crowdsource” (CR) dataset combines the uncorrected core and evaluation ROIs for NPs to form a training dataset with noisy labels for assessing crowdsourcing methods. A gold standard training dataset combines corrected ROIs from NPs with evaluation ROIs from the SPs. The testing set used to assess performance was composed of core ROIs from SPs and corrected core ROIs from NPs.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10225</offset><text>The data used in our experiments originate from an international study where pathology experts and non-experts annotated breast cancer tissue regions in a crowdsourcing process. In this study a web-based platform was used to annotate breast cancer tissue regions by two senior/practicing pathologists (SP), and 20 non-pathologists (NP) consisting of medical students and fresh graduates. A study coordinator selected 161 rectangular regions of interest (ROIs) from 151 whole-slide images of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded sections from the TCGA Breast Cancer cohort. ROIs were selected to capture representative patterns of tumor, stroma, and immune infiltrates, as well as less common regions and structures including necrosis, blood vessels, and fat. Images and ROIs were hosted on a Digital Slide Archive server where participants could access them through a web-browser and use their mouse to annotate tissue regions in the ROIs using the polyline tool.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>11185</offset><text>ROIs were assigned to two categories to provide both adequate breadth for training ML algorithms and to enable assessment of interobserver variability in annotation. Core ROIs provide breadth, being present in all 151 slides, and were divided among the users (approximately 6 per user) based on a difficulty score assigned by the study coordinator. Participants first annotated their core ROIs and then solicited feedback from an SP who applied corrections in multiple feedback cycles. This provided two versions of the core ROI: (1) Uncorrected core ROIs and (2) Corrected core ROIs. Ten additional Evaluation ROIs were created in the slide set and assigned to all NP participants to assess interobserver variability. Annotation of evaluation ROIs was performed following completion of core ROIs; evaluation ROI annotations were not corrected. The DICE coefficient for segmentation annotations made by SPs was as follows: 0.87 (tumor), 0.81 (stroma), and 0.52 (lymphocytic infiltration). Further details on the interobserver variability for both SPs and NPs is discussed in detail in Ref..</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>12276</offset><text>We performed a collection of experiments to assess the impact of training data quality and the effectiveness of crowdsourcing approaches. We considered a multiclass problem with three different classes: tumor, stroma, and immune infiltrates. We also compared Gaussian processes (with features from pre-trained convolutional networks) with state-of-the-art deep learning models like CrowdLayer. Data quality was examined by formulating three training sets with varying label quality (see Fig. 2): (1) Gold standard training combines corrected core ROI annotations with SP annotations on evaluation ROIs; (2) Majority vote training (MV) combines uncorrected NP core ROI annotations with pixel-wise majority voting over NP evaluation ROI annotations; (3) Crowdsourcing training (CR) combines all uncorrected NP core ROI annotations and all NP evaluation ROI annotations. The gold standard training set represents a gold-standard where all annotations are generated, corrected, or approved by SPs. The MV training set represents a naive approach to improving data quality by averaging over noisy NP annotations. The CR training set represents a true crowdsourcing experiment where NP annotations are not corrected or revised by experts or smoothed through averaging.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>13539</offset><text>First we measured the impact of training data quality on SVGP and VGG16 methods that weigh all labels and annotators equally, comparing their performance with smoothed label MV training and gold standard training. Next, we assessed the ability of crowdsourcing methods like AggNet, CrowdLayer (CL), and SVGPCR, which learn annotator reliability using CR training generated through crowdsourcing with non-experts. The first two are recent methods based on deep learning. For Crowdlayer, depending on the annotator modeling, we can distinguish three different models: CL-MW, CL-VW, and CL-VWB. CL-VW incorporates a vector of per-class weights, an additional bias is considered for CL-VWB and, the most complex, CL-MW computes the whole confusion matrix of the annotators. SVGPCR is based on scalable Gaussian Processes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">41598_2021_90821_Fig3_HTML.jpg</infon><infon key="id">Fig3</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>14357</offset><text>Probabilistic graphical model for SVGPCR.

Visual inspection of these predictions shows that SVGPCR can learn and reproduce the biases of individual annotators. NP17 tends to call some stromal regions as tumor, and the SVGPCR inferred predictions for NP17 also exhibit this tendency. NP19 is less sensitive in annotating tumor, missing a large region that was annotated by the SP, and we see this same lack of sensitivity in SVGPCR inference for NP19. NP21 is not sensitive in detecting a group of inflammatory cells, and we also see that their SVGPCR inference lacks sensitivity in detecting these cells as well. Quantitative analysis of agreement between SVGPCR inferences for specific annotators and their uncorrected annotations is presented in Table 3. The quantization is made by reconstructing the pixel-level of annotators using the patches annotations. The similarity of the annotations and the predictions is performed using the DICE coefficient. This coefficient measures the similarity between them. The 95% confidence interval of the DICE scores averaged over the 20 NPs is . The average DICE score when comparing SVGPCR inferred gold standard with the expert SP annotations lies outside this interval at 0.8072.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">41598_2021_90821_Fig4_HTML.jpg</infon><infon key="id">Fig4</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>25864</offset><text>Visualizing annotator-specific inferences. We performed additional experiments to assess the ability of SVGPCR to learn the biases of individuals. The color in the masks encode tumor (red), stroma (green), lymphocytic infiltrates (blue) and other classes (black). (A) Two SVGPCR classifiers were trained. The first training set combined the core ROIs and first 5 evaluation ROIs, and performed inference on the second 5 evaluation ROIs. The evaluation ROIs were then swapped, and the training and inference were repeated. For each ROI, the trained SVGP and reliability annotation matrices were used to generate an annotator-specific inference. This inference was compared with the actual annotation and the annotation from the SP to observe differences. The patch-based analysis resulted in some quantization, so the quantized and original annotations are both presented. (B) This ROI contains a band of stroma from the upper center to the lower right that separates two regions of tumor, and a region of necrosis on the right. The inferred true labels correspond closely to the SP annotation. Participant NP17 is more sensitive in annotating tumor, and their inferred annotation exhibits the same pattern. (C) This ROI contains an island of tumor separated from regions of dense immune infiltrates by a wide area of stroma. The inferred true labels correspond closely with the SP annotation. Participant NP19 is not very sensitive in labeling tumor by comparison, and the tumor in the annotator inference is also absent. (D) This ROI contains tumor in the lower left and a small pocket of immune infiltrates in the upper right. The immune infiltrates are present in both the SP annotation and the inferred true labels. The immune infiltrates are absent from the annotation of participant NP21, and are mostly absent from the inferred annotation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>27711</offset><text>Discussion</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27722</offset><text>Data is often the limiting factor in training and validating machine learning algorithms for biomedical applications. When domain experts like pathologists are needed to produce ground-truth labels, generating data at the scale required by algorithms like convolutional networks is often difficult. This study seeks to address this problem by examining how a probabilistic approach to integrating annotations from novices can compete with algorithms trained using gold-standard data generated by experts. As a statistical machine learning method, Gaussian processes provide a framework for estimating the accuracy of annotators, including class-conditional accuracies, and to use this information in making inferences of ground truth. Our experiments show that SVGPCR trained on noisy labels obtained from novices in digital pathology crowdsourcing studies can compete with state of the art algorithms trained on gold standard labels.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28657</offset><text>We used a unique data resource to compare Gaussian processes based methods with other crowdsourcing approaches. The BRCA tissue region dataset contains over 20,000 tissue regions, including both novice and expert-corrected annotations, enabling comparison of crowdsourcing methods trained on novice annotations to methods trained on gold-standard annotations. Our experiments demonstrated that data quality impacts the performance of methods that are not based on crowdsourcing. SVGP and VGG models trained using a “majority vote” training dataset that averaged novice annotations had inferior performance compared to the same models trained using gold standard annotations. Under the optimistic conditions of training with gold standard annotations, SVGP and VGG had similar performance, with SVGP having a slight advantage in F1, AUC, accuracy and a large improvement in loss on the testing data, showing that Gaussian process models can compete with convolutional networks in this example.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>29654</offset><text>The best crowdsourcing methods including SVGPCR and CrowdLayer variants trained using novice annotations have performance comparable to methods trained using gold standard annotations. This result suggests that in some circumstances, expert correction of novice annotations may not be necessary for annotations used in training. Performance differences for SVGPCR and CrowdLayer were small compared to differences between methods trained with majority vote and gold standard data, suggesting that the annotator and class conditional weighting applied by crowdsourcing methods is superior to basic smoothing of novice data labels. SVGPCR performance in classifying tumor and stroma was significantly higher than for immune infiltrates. This parallels the patterns of interobserver variability observed during the crowdsourcing study. Tumor and stroma are defined by sharp boundaries and in our annotation data we see significantly better concordance among annotators for these tissue types. Immune infiltration is diffuse and regions infiltrated by immune cells lack a sharp boundary, requiring annotators to judge their density which is much more subjective. This translates to higher interobserver variability among annotators for immune infiltrates, and likely presents a greater challenge for SVGPCR. Regions of immune infiltration are also less prevalent in our dataset than regions of tumor and stroma.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>31062</offset><text>We also showed how SVGPCR can reproduce the biases of specific annotators through inference. This result suggests that SVGPCR could help assigning work to annotators on the basis of their relative strengths and weaknesses as observed in their class-conditional accuracies. By modeling class-conditional annotator accuracy, SVGPCR learns how to weight the labels of each annotator during training to improve inference of gold standard labels. We provide visual and quantitative evidence that show how annotator-specific inferences produced by SVGPCR agrees with the withheld annotations on these test images, and reflects the sensitivities of annotators to various classes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>31735</offset><text>While these results suggest that SVGPCR may help reduce the annotation burden in digital pathology tasks, there are some important limitations in our study. Quantizing segmentation annotations to the patch level was necessary to provide a neighborhood of pixels for SVGPCR to learn from, however, this results in a loss of detail. While this quantization was necessary to conduct our studies, SVGPCR may be more appropriate for patch level problems like cell classification than for segmentation problems where fine details need to be represented. While SVGPCR likely benefits from the presence of a variety of annotators, some being more specific or more sensitive for different classes, it is not well understood when variability in annotations may pose a problem for learning. Furthermore, while some common evaluations regions among annotators are likely necessary for SVGPCR to learn the strengths and weaknesses of each annotator, it is not well understood how the balance of evaluation and core ROIs impacts SVGPCR performance. The core regions increase the breadth of the training set, and the annotation of evaluation regions reduces this breadth given a fixed budget of annotator time. We also plan to explore how the class-conditional accuracies learned by SVGPCR can improve assignment data to participants in crowdsourcing experiments and can help participants to understand their weaknesses and to improve them. This could be accomplished by iterative training of an SVGPCR model during crowdsourcing studies. We are also interested in exploring how the number of evaluation and core regions impacts SVGPCR performance.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>33369</offset><text>Supplementary Information</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>33395</offset><text>Publisher's note</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>33412</offset><text>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>33531</offset><text>Supplementary Information</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>33557</offset><text>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-021-90821-3.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">AUTH_CONT</infon><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>33649</offset><text>Author contributions</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">AUTH_CONT</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>33670</offset><text>M.L., P.R., L.A.D.C., R.M., and A.K.K. conceived the ideas and designed the study.
