Implementing biosecurity disease prevention measures can be expensive, so producers must balance the costs of biosecurity investments with the expected benefits of reducing the risk of infections. To investigate the risk associated with this decision making process, we developed an online experimental game that simulates biosecurity investment allocation of a pork production facility during an outbreak. Participants are presented with several scenarios that vary the visibility of the disease status and biosecurity protection implemented at neighboring facilities. Certain rounds allowed participants to spend resources to reduce uncertainty and reveal neighboring biosecurity and/or disease status. We then test how this uncertainty affects the decisions to spend simulation dollars to increase biosecurity and reduce risk. We recruited 50 attendees from the 2018 World Pork Expo to participate in our simulation. We compared their performance to an opportunity sample of 50 online participants from the survey crowdsourcing tool, Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). With respect to biosecurity investment, we did not find a significant difference between the risk behaviors of industry professionals and those of MTurk participants for each set of experimental scenarios. Notably, we found that our sample of industry professionals opted to pay to reveal disease and biosecurity information more often than MTurk participants. However, the biosecurity investment decisions were not significantly different during rounds in which additional information could be purchased. To further validate these findings, we compared the risk associated with each group's responses using a well-established risk assessment survey implementing paired lottery choices. Interestingly, we did not find a correlation in risk quantified with simulated biosecurity investment in comparison to the paired lottery choice survey. This may be evidence that general economic risk preferences may not always translate into simulated behavioral risk, perhaps due to the contextual immersion provided by experimental gaming simulations. Online recruitment tools can provide cost effective research quality data that can be rapidly assembled in comparison to industry professionals, who may be more challenging to sample at scale. Using a convenience sample of industry professionals for validation can also provide additional insights into the decision making process. These findings lend support to using online experimental simulations for interpreting risk associated with a complex decision mechanism.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>2876</offset><text>1. Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2892</offset><text>Disease outbreaks across livestock production systems can have devastating economic consequences. Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDv), for example, is a coronavirus that costs the U.S. industry an estimated $900 million to $1.8 billion per year. Here, biosecurity refers to the initiative to stem the spread of disease in agriculture, which include a set of tools for disease prevention (i.e., vaccines) along with sanitary regulations and protocols that can mitigate disease transmission across production systems. Increased biosecurity reduces disease transmission between producers. However, biosecurity tools and practices vary in cost and perceived efficacy. Hence, supply chain managers must balance the costs of biosecurity investments with the expected benefits of reducing the risk of infection. Our aim is to investigate the strategies used to achieve this balance, by quantifying risk mitigation behaviors associated with economic investment in biosecurity. Our research approach focuses on applying digital simulations for studying this decision making process.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3969</offset><text>Experimental gaming simulations, a branch of “serious gaming,” are tailored interfaces that leverage software from game design to recreate a complex decision mechanism.

Our experimental gaming simulation tests risk preference with regards to several scenarios in which disease prevalence and neighboring biosecurity visibility are varied. By injecting different types of uncertainty into experimental game simulations, we can explicitly observe response to uncertainty and how it may change as risk communication strategies adapt.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4988</offset><text>Our previous study analyzed the risk associated with biosecurity investment decisions across a multitude of disease outbreak scenarios. Using a sample of 1,000 participants from an online survey recruitment marketplace, Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), we found three prominent risk strategies—risk tolerant, opportunistic, and risk averse—by analyzing responses with regard to disease threat. We then investigated how information uncertainty affects the decision making process, by varying the visibility of the disease spread and biosecurity protection across each simulated population of farms. Among this sample, we found that high visibility in disease spread led to more risk averse behaviors while high visibility in biosecurity status led to more risk tolerance. We also investigated how risk preference may differ among a sample of industry professionals and stakeholders. We attended the 2018 World Pork Expo, the world's largest pork industry trade show attended by thousands of producers and industry professionals (https://worldpork.org/about-expo/all-about-expo). Here, we recruited 50 attendees to complete our experimental gaming simulation. Their performance was then compared to 50 MTurk recruits, in addition to the 1,000 recruits sampled in. When aggregating across all experimental outbreak scenarios, we did not find a significant difference in biosecurity investment risk distributions. In this work, we aim to further investigate potential differences in risk preference among World Pork Expo participants and online recruits from MTurk. We compare biosecurity investment decisions during each set of experimental scenarios as well as the willingness to spend economic resources to reduce uncertainty.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6717</offset><text>We also compare our sampled participants' behavior using a well-established risk assessment survey using paired lottery choices. This context-free, multiple price list approach measures risk aversion with respect to economic preference by varying the probability of a high and low payout. Using their choices, participants can then be categorically grouped into “Risk Seeking,” “Risk Neutral,” or “Risk Averse.” The main difference between this paired lottery choice assessment and our experimental gaming simulations is the context surrounding the decision making process. The paired lottery choice assessment attempts to measure underlying preferences in a purely economic trade-off. Whereas the economic risk management associated with biosecurity investment decisions are specifically framed in the context of agricultural outbreak mitigation. We compare risk preferences associated with lottery choices against simulated biosecurity investment strategies between World Pork Expo participants and MTurk recruits.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7746</offset><text>Several studies investigated how risk aversion delineated using this paired lottery choice assessment have compared to real world behaviors. Experimental market trading behaviors were found to correlate with paired choice lottery risk aversion. Negative health related behaviors including cigarette smoking, heavy drinking, obesity, and seat-belt non-compliance were found to be anti-correlated with surveyed risk aversion. Similarly, a generalized self-assessment risk survey could predict surveyed lottery risk aversion. These contexts based risk aversion measures were actually in some cases better predictors of malbehaviors in comparison to multiple price list assessments. This difference in performance may be attributed to additional background information captured regarding the individuals' preferences using context based measures of risk aversion.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>8606</offset><text>Providing contextual background to the studied decision making process can have a pronounced effect on risk mitigation. For example, the domain specific risk-taking scale (DOSPERT) is a context driven risk assessment questionnaire which has shown promising results in characterizing risk averse behaviors across several content domains. This flexible measurement is useful for categorizing risk with respect to content areas in which individuals may exhibit various levels of risk aversion depending on the framing. Context based risk assessments can provide additional insights into behavioral response and how risk may fluctuate with respect to situational framing.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9274</offset><text>Our experimental gaming simulation exemplifies this initiative for capturing contextually driven risk mitigation behaviors. We found that risk aversion characterized by multiple choice lottery assessment differed from risk associated with behaviors in our simulated environment. This supports the argument that context driven risk assessment may be more appropriate for identifying behavioral risk regarding specific domains. Capturing these nuanced behaviors may prove illusive in the lens of traditional multiple price list risk assessment frameworks.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9828</offset><text>Our previous findings did not detect a difference in biosecurity investment decisions between World Pork Expo attendees and recruits from MTurk. However, aside from biosecurity investment, other behavioral aspects may differ between these cohorts. Our current study investigates how Pork Expo attendees and online recruits from Amazon Mechanical Turk may diverge in their decision making with respect to each tested experimental scenario. Although we previously found the overall distributions of risk were comparable between Pork Expo and MTurk groups, it is also important to highlight where there may be differences in simulated behavior. This validation process is necessary when recruiting large convenience samples from online survey marketplaces.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10582</offset><text>(H1): Participants with industry knowledge will invest more experimental resources to procure information and reduce uncertainty in the decision making process.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10743</offset><text>Along with the ability to invest in biosecurity, our simulation allowed participants to purchase information to reduce uncertainty in the decision making process by revealing infection and biosecurity status of neighboring facilities.

The experimental gaming simulation and risk assessment survey were engineered using the Unity Development Platform. The final application was deployed using WebGL and hosted on the University of Vermont's web server, where simulation decision data were stored in a relational database. The 2018 World Pork Expo participants completed the experiment in our booth using provided tablet computers. The 50 online participants were contracted using Amazon Mechanical Turk and compensated through Amazon with a base pay of $2.00 USD for successfully completing the assignment along with a bonus payment based upon their simulation performance. On average MTurk participants earned an additional $7.93 (σ = $4.98) and completed the experiment in 10.92 min (σ = 4.80 min), after the introductory on-boarding. We paid the participants at the World Pork Expo a higher rate to bolster attendance and interest. Pork Expo participants earned on average $16.11 (σ = $4.26) over 15.97 min (σ = 4.91 min) to complete the simulation and survey. These monetary incentives are crucial to our experimental design and have been found to increase salience and immersion in the decision making process.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>13742</offset><text>2.1.

We collected a total of 18,716 decisions to compare (9437 Pork Expo; 9279 MTurk). Numbers differ slightly because decisions during a round would be truncated if the participant's facility became infected. Each round of decision making featured adaptations to the interface and/or information regarding the infection status and biosecurity allocation among the population of farms (see Figure 1). The participant is in charge of a single production facility, surrounded by 50 computer-controlled facilities. Every round consists of six decision months in which players have the choice to invest their simulation dollars in more biosecurity for their own facility. The simulated dollars earned were converted to U.S. currency after completion of the experiment. Online recruits were compensated at a rate of $1 USD to $23,500 simulation dollars, on top of their base pay of $2.00 USD for completing the assignment.

If the player did not wish to invest in biosecurity, they could choose “No Action” to continue to the next decision month. At the end of each decision month, the infection could progress to any production facility with a varying infection rate probability (pinf = 0.15) that decreased with distance from the infection source. Explicitly, the raw probability of transmission between an infected facility and a clean facility separated by distance, D, would be calculated as , which was then adjusted by the clean facility's biosecurity level. If the player's facility became infected, the round would immediately end and the player would lose $25,000 simulation dollars.

Participants are instructed to choose their preference across ten distinct paired lottery choices. Each pair of choices features a safer “Option A” in comparison to a more risky “Option B,” which has a higher pay gap between the two reward probabilities. For example, the first choice features Option A as a 1/10 chance to earn $2.00 and a 9/10 chance to earn $1.60, while Option B presents a 1/10 chance to earn $3.85 and a 9/10 chance to earn $0.10. Here, only the most risk tolerant of individuals may consider choosing Option B over Option A. This probability gap between the higher and lower payment for each choice sequentially increased, such that the more risky option becomes more viable as the survey progresses (i.e., the expected payoff of Option B becomes greater than the expected payoff of Option A). By choice 7, the payout probability is now 7/10 for each high reward and 3/10 for the low reward (see Figure 2). Here, it becomes somewhat ambiguous which is the more appropriate option, creating an interesting risk dilemma to study.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">fvets-07-556668-g0002.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F2</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>19292</offset><text>Paired lottery choice risk Assessment interface: a sample of the menu design of the paired lottery choice survey.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>19406</offset><text>A natural “crossover point” occurs where a rational individual may move from choosing the safer Option A to a more risky Option B.

The most pronounced difference was the amount of spending by Pork Expo participants on neighboring biosecurity status information. Overall, both groups invested the most resources on reducing uncertainty around disease spread. Pork Expo participants, perhaps due to their industry profiles, had significantly more interest in neighboring biosecurity configurations than MTurk recruits.

One possibility for this lack of consistency in observed behaviors across the two risk assessment methods is the contextual framing that's motivating decisions within the experimental gaming simulation. The lottery risk preference may be contrasted as a measure of pure economic risk preference. Our simulated environment creates a more complex and realistic economic dilemma to tackle. This difference is especially highlighted during rounds that inject additional uncertainty in the decision making process by masking the spread of infection and/or shielding neighboring biosecurity configurations. This provides support for harnessing experimental gaming simulations to study behavioral risk. Experimental gaming simulations may be especially useful for emulating complex decision mechanisms in which nuanced behavioral signals may be difficult to capture using generalized risk assessment survey strategies. Further investigation is needed to accentuate these differences in behavioral responses associated with added contextual framing provided by experimental simulations, in comparison to traditional survey methods for measuring risk preference.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>37475</offset><text>Overall, the distributions of risk associated with our biosecurity investment simulation were statistically comparable to our sample of 50 industry professionals and stakeholders from the 2018 World Pork Expo.

This may also strengthen our result that the risk distributions with regards to biosecurity investment were similar. We also were limited by our sample size, as recruiting industry professionals is challenging in comparison to online survey marketplaces like MTurk. Hence, it is possible that a larger sampling of participants with an industry background are required to detect differences in behavior.

Perhaps this could have been due to survey fatigue, as the Pork Expo attendees were attending the fair recreationally, whereas the MTurk recruits were seeking an employment opportunity. Also, the final lottery choice sets the high payouts for both Option A and Option B at 10/10, so the most rational decision is to choose Option B for this last question. Although the vast majority of participants from both cohorts finished with “Option B,” there was 1 case from the MTurk group and 8 cases from the Pork Expo attendees ending with “Option A.” This difference could also be a sign of potential survey fatigue, or a misunderstanding of the lottery payouts for the final question. Overall the proportion of safe choices between each cohort was comparable and hence this metric for risk aversion was ideal for comparing behavior.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>40340</offset><text>The decision-making data collected from experimental gaming simulations is not only informative in itself but also a valuable resource for disease-spread models lacking a human behavioral component. For example, agent based models (ABMs),, are computer simulations that can help forecast outcomes of decisions and interactions of entities (or agents) and their impact on the system. Agent based modeling has been applied to agriculture for producer decision interaction,, technology and policy modeling,, as well as for water management. ABMs can provide insights into epidemiological factors that exacerbate disease spread and their economic impacts on agricultural supply chains. Human behavioral components, captured using digital experimental simulations, can then be used to model systemic outbreaks and how disease spread will change as human behavior is altered or risk communication strategies are devised. The distributions of behavioral risk observed in our biosecurity experimental gaming simulations can be embedded in these agent based models to test how proportions of risk aversion effect the spread of disease. The model can then be calibrated using real world estimates of viral incidence. Experimental gaming simulations can also provide insights into how individuals may adapt their risk preferences over time. Individuals may learn to become more or less risk averse in response to their simulated outcomes. Studying how different proportions of these risk attitudes effect the spread of disease can help gain insights into forecasting economic impacts and how different risk landscapes impact the well-being of the system. This may be useful to policy regulators interested in developing and testing risk communication strategies that nudge behaviors toward more risk averse disease management practices to help stem the spread of disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>42201</offset><text>Experimental gaming simulations are effective tools for examining behaviors surrounding risk associated with agricultural disease mitigation. These readily adaptable simulations allow us to tailor interfaces for capturing subtle behavioral differences while also harnessing population-wide patterns that can be useful for modeling behaviors associated with disease management and prevention. While we do not endorse moving solely to experimental gaming simulations for gathering human behavioral data, our research demonstrates how the additional context provided via simulation can capture distinct behaviors potentially missed using traditional survey methods. Moreover, experimental gaming simulations can increase salience and engagement by immersing participants in real-world dilemmas, thus providing an alternative viewpoint that may more closely approximate real world behavior, and could be used in conjunction with traditional methods to improve our understanding of human decision making processes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>43211</offset><text>Understanding how behavior in simulated gaming environments translates to real world decisions by industry professionals is an important consideration of this behavioral research. This is still an open question that we'll continue to investigate through our research agenda. Rigorous behavioral validation is challenging due to the vast number of decisions that are tested in our simulation, and by design, farmers are unlikely to have experienced these specific decisions in the real world. The flexibility of the gaming environment to gather behaviors across a multitude of possible scenarios can provide insights into risk management investment strategies that may be difficult to discern using traditional survey instruments. We are also working toward adapting our behavioral games into digital tools and interfaces that may allow industry professionals to emulate their own production system. Creating these decision support tools from our experimental game design may help us better investigate how choices in a simulated environment relate to real-world behavior. This evolution of our experimental gaming simulations into decision support applications may provide insight into the decision making process to mitigate the spread of disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>44460</offset><text>Online survey marketplaces, like MTurk, can provide an effective and rapid medium for recruitment in behavioral research studies. We found that the distributions of risk associated with disease management were comparable between a sample of industry professionals and online recruits. We also identified aspects in which industry knowledge can differ throughout the presented risk dilemma. In particular, we found those with an industry background had a greater propensity to reduce uncertainty in the decision making process. Our study demonstrates the importance of validating simulated behaviors using a sample of participants with industry knowledge, in order to identify and account for potential differences that may be associated with their agricultural background. The similarities in general behavioral risk we've further investigated in this study also help validate our findings in Clark et al., which tested hypotheses on a much larger sample (N = 1, 000) of online recruits. Our research framework highlights the viability of online marketplaces for behavioral analysis, while also demonstrating how targeted recruitment from industry stakeholders can provide additional insights into these complex decision mechanisms.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>45693</offset><text>Managing the economic factors associated with disease risk management is a complex quandary. Here we quantify behavioral aspects of the decision making under risk associated with mitigating the spread of disease while maximizing profits using experimental gaming simulations. Importantly, we found that risk preferences assigned via the paired lottery choice survey were not adequate in predicting behaviors in our simulated environment. These studied behaviors and their effect on the well-being of the system as a whole should be further investigated for the promotion of healthier agricultural production networks.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>46311</offset><text>Data Availability Statement</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>46339</offset><text>The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>46461</offset><text>Ethics Statement</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>46478</offset><text>The studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by University of Vermont IRB # CHRBSS-16-232-IRB.
