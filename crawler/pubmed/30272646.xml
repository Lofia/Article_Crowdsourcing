Streptomyces coelicolor is a well-characterized, non-pathogenic species that is amenable to a variety of analyses in the lab. The phenotyping methods described here use S. coelicolor as a model streptomycete; however, the methods are applicable to all members of this large genus as well as some closely related actinomycetes. Phenotyping is necessary to characterize new species of Streptomyces identified in the environment, and it is also a vital first step in characterizing newly isolated mutant strains of Streptomyces. Proficiency in phenotyping is important for the many new researchers who are entering the field of Streptomyces research, which includes the study of bacterial development, cell division, chromosome segregation, and second messenger signaling. The recent crowdsourcing of antibiotic discovery through the isolation of new soil microbes has resulted in an increased need for training in phenotyping for instructors new to the field of Streptomyces research and their college or high school students. This manuscript describes methods for bacterial strain propagation, storage, and characterization through visual and microscopic examination. After reading this article, new researchers (microbiology education laboratories and citizen scientists) should be able to manipulate Streptomyces strains and begin visual characterization experiments.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1634</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1647</offset><text>Streptomycetes are Gram-positive, filamentous soil bacteria known for their ability to produce a variety of secondary metabolites, including over two-thirds of the commercially available antibiotics, as well as anti-tumor, anti-HIV, and anti-parasitic drugs. S. coelicolor is the most genetically characterized member of the genus and is the species used in the methods described here. S. coelicolor has a complex life cycle that begins with germination of a single spore, progressing to an extensive, branching vegetative mycelium that grows into the agar medium. As the life cycle proceeds, aerial filaments are formed that break the surface tension of the substrate mycelium and are finally divided into long chains of cells that are ultimately converted into mature, grey-pigmented spores. Dispersion of these newly formed spores constitutes the beginning of the next life cycle.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2531</offset><text>Because of its complex pattern of differentiation, S. coelicolor serves as an excellent model for the study of bacterial development. Historically, mutations result in blocks for two major stages of development and produce distinct visual phenotypes. The bld (bald) mutants are blocked for aerial mycelium formation and result in the lack of a fuzzy aerial mycelium imparting a &quot;bald&quot; colony appearance. Mutants inhibited in spore formation and maturation are referred to as whi (white) mutants because they typically fail to produce wild-type levels of the gray spore pigment and the aerial mycelium remains white. Other interesting mutants are inhibited in antibiotic production, cell division, chromosome segregation, or other important processes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3282</offset><text>Despite the discovery of many developmental genes in Streptomyces species, there are many more believed to exist based on the lack of saturation of mutant screens. Our laboratories continue to identify new developmental genes using a mini-transposon system that we have constructed. Novel mutant strains isolated in random mutagenesis experiments with our transposon undergo phenotypic screening to identify the possible role of each new gene discovered. The methods for bacterial phenotyping described here are relevant to Streptomyces mutants isolated by transposon mutagenesis and other random methods, such as chemical and ultra-violet (UV) mutagenesis, as well as the directed construction of mutations such as gene deletions using recombineering or CRISPR-Cas9 (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) genome editing technology and point mutations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4156</offset><text>As antibiotic resistance among pathogens becomes increasingly prevalent, the need for new antibiotics becomes increasingly urgent. The &quot;Small World Initiative&quot; (or SWI) is an effective Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) learning and research strategy to combat antibiotic resistance through the crowdsourcing of college students, and more recently high school students. Supported courses work includes identifying new soil microbes that produce novel antibiotics (http://www.smallworldinitiative.org). It is believed that a major source of undiscovered antibiotics will continue to be Streptomyces species found in a wide range of soil and water habitats. Recently, our laboratory and the work of others have discovered and characterized signaling genes in Streptomyces species that regulate morphology and development, including antibiotic production. Changes in expression of these genes result in a change in the amount and timing of antibiotics produced. Skilled phenotyping of new species and new antibiotic-producing mutants will continue to be important. As new instructors and their students become major contributors to the field of drug discovery, training in bacterial phenotyping is necessary for the success of these novice individuals. Furthermore, these experiments are tractable for high school STEM or university microbiology education laboratories. They represent a demonstration of basic microbial genetic principles in a teaching lab setting.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>5640</offset><text>Protocol</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>5649</offset><text>1.

Streptomyces mutants resulting from random mutagenesis methods such as chemical, UV, or transposon mutagenesis are typically identified through direct, visual screens on agar plates. Colonies of Streptomyces are examined for changes in phenotype in comparison to the wild-type, parental strain. For example, a lighter colored aerial mycelium may indicate a lower level of gray pigment caused by a defect in sporulation, or the lack of a fuzzy appearance is indicative of a block in aerial mycelium formation (Figure 1). Many streptomycetes produce pigmented antibiotics in vegetative mycelium or surrounding agar. S. coelicolor produces two pigmented antibiotics as well as two non-pigmented ones. Actinorhodin is a blue-pigmented antibiotic and undecylprodigiosin is a red-pigmented antibiotic. Strains that have undergone initial visual colony screens are then propagated by streaking for single colonies.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>18109</offset><text>Following visual identification of potentially interesting mutants, strains are subjected to microscopic examination. Phase-contrast microscopy is especially suited to examining Streptomyces mutants for developmental defects, using the wild-type strain as a control (Figure 2). Wild type S. coelicolor colonies typically produce an aerial mycelium by about two days of growth at 30 °C on MS agar, and long chains of spores by three days of growth. The life cycle will progress slightly slower or faster on other types of media. It is imperative that the mutants be analyzed under the same growth conditions as the wild type when drawing conclusions about the developmental defects and delays. Bald mutants may produce spores after prolonged growth on agar media. A class of mutants referred to as white mutants may either be delayed for spore formation, show a reduction in the abundance of spores produced, produce spores with shape and/or size defects, or simply produce lower levels of the mature, gray spore pigment. Other mutants investigated thus far may be delayed or accelerated in the life cycle progression such as the mutants affected for the accumulation of signaling molecules (e.g., cyclic-di-GMP).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>19323</offset><text>A simple follow-up to the light microscopy technique described above is fluorescence microscopy using propidium iodide to stain chromosomal DNA nucleoids and fluorescently labeled wheat germ agglutinin to stain the cell wall of sporulation septa. Spores lacking a chromosome will be devoid of the red propidium iodide staining, while spores that contain less DNA than usual may be identified if they appear to have decreased staining (Figure 3). Wheat germ agglutinin may be used to stain the cell wall and differences in cell wall staining patterns (i.e., cell division defects) may be observed. In Figure 4 the wild-type strain of S. venezuelae, a species that is recently being used as another model streptomycete because of its faster life cycle and ability to sporulate in liquid, has been stained with WGA-FITC to elucidate the ladder-like array of division septa that are typically seen early during sporulation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>20243</offset><text>The initial phenotyping strategies described here should result in the following: 1) Identification of mutant strains of interest for further study; 2) Acquired knowledge about the newly identified mutant and the potential role of the gene that has been mutated; 3) The formulation of a subsequent series of next experimental steps that can be used to further clarify the role of the gene in question.

(A) Shown is a representative wild type aerial filament that has undergone synchronous, regularly-spaced cell divisions, producing evenly shaped and sized spores (MT1110). (B-F) The remaining panels show the vastly different microscopic phenotypes of various white mutants that were isolated via random transposon mutagenesis. Panel B shows an aerial filament that has not undergone sporulation, but instead has produced bulging areas within the filament. Long arrows in C, D, and F indicate abnormally large spores that are characteristic of mutants MIC42, MIC43, and TH49. The short arrow in panel D indicates an example of a lysed spore compartment. Panel E shows the partially constricted smaller compartments that are typical of the spore chains produced by mutant TH10. The strains were grown on MS agar for 5 days at 30 °C. The mutants are unrelated to those shown in Figure 1. A wild type spore is approximately 1.1 µm on the long axis. Scale bar = 2 µm.

We then describe the protocols for visual and microscopic characterization of Streptomyces strains. Some typical initial steps in phenotyping developmental mutants are: 1) visual examination of the mutant colonies compared to wild type colonies on agar medium; 2) phase-contrast microscopy; and 3) fluorescence microscopy of sporogenic aerial hyphae. Based upon the phenotype displayed in these three steps, a variety of techniques may be employed to further discern the phenotype of a particular strain.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>25298</offset><text>Initial phenotyping experiments are commonly used to characterize new species, identify mutants of interest, partially characterize mutants, and begin to discern the typical role of a particular gene based on the phenotype of an identified mutant. The methods described here have already been used in university teaching laboratories to identify and characterize a wide variety of Streptomyces mutants, including those with defects in cell division, sporulation, aerial mycelium formation, antibiotic production, second messenger signaling, and chromosome segregation. These techniques are the vital first steps to determining the phenotype of mutants in general and reveal a large amount of important information about the roles of genes of interest. The methods may easily be extended to other species of Streptomyces and have already been used to describe strains of S. griseus, S. venezuelae, S. scabies, and many other streptomycetes. The video protocols described here are expected to serve as an important resource for new researchers entering fields of Streptomyces research, such as in the area of drug discovery. This includes the new instructors who are working to combat the antibiotic resistance crisis and educating the countless numbers of new undergraduate student researchers joining the crowdsourcing efforts of the Small World Initiative.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>26656</offset><text>The techniques described here can be easily adapted to college and high school classroom use in addition to research laboratories, using the modifications described in the video and text. Students in a first year microscopy module at a small liberal arts college were able to streak strains, take digital photographs of strains grown on agar media, and perform phase-contrast and fluorescence microscopy, which culminated in the submission of a portfolio of multi-paneled figures at the end of the 3 week module, representing 15 h of in-lab work. Approximately 160 first year students were responsible for the initial phenotyping of 320 novel transposon mutants. Undergraduate research students at three institutions participated in the initial phenotyping of additional mutants and the subsequent characterization of many of the strains. The comprehensive data obtained in a relatively short period of time, illustrate the value of the protocols described here. Hundreds of additional mutants have been stored as glycerol mycelial stocks for future characterization.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27724</offset><text>Following the initial experiments described here, a variety of methods may be employed to extend the quality of information pertaining to strains of interest. If the mutation is unknown, a genotyping method should be employed to determine the type and/or location of the mutation. For example, random transposon mutagenesis of the wild-type chromosome results in colonies that should undergo initial phenotypic screens such as those described above. Then the location of the transposon should be identified using a technique such as inverse polymerase chain reaction (iPCR). Determining the genotype of newly discovered mutants is an important step following initial characterization.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28409</offset><text>Some commonly used advanced methods for subsequent phenotyping analysis that may be mentioned in the classroom or explored through further research include green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagging to determine localization patterns for the protein of interest, gene expression analyses such as real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and global gene expression patterns of wild-type versus mutant via RNA Sequencing (RNA-seq). Phenotyping skills are also required for genetic complementation analysis. In a complementation experiment, the wild-type copy of a gene is introduced into a mutated strain to determine whether the newly added allele can compensate for the loss-of-function of the mutated allele. Comparing the phenotype of the complemented strain to that of both the original mutant and the parental, wild-type strain is required.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">COMP_INT</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>29244</offset><text>Disclosures</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">COMP_INT</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>29256</offset><text>The authors have nothing to disclose.</text></passage><passage><infon key="fpage">1</infon><infon key="issue">1</infon><infon key="lpage">43</infon><infon key="name_0">surname:Barka;given-names:EA</infon><infon key="pub-id_pmid">26609051</infon><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="source">Microbiol.
