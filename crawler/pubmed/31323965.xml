The bottleneck in this technology is the quality of the GNSS receivers. Therefore, we lay out in an introductory manner the steps to estimate the performance of an arbitrary GNSS receiver via the measurement errors related to its instrumentation. Specifically, we do not need to know the position of the receiver antenna, which allows also for the assessment of smartphone GNSS receivers having integrated antennas. Moreover, the method is independent of atmospheric errors so that no ionospheric or tropospheric correction services provided by base stations are needed. Error models for performance evaluation can be calculated from receiver RINEX (receiver independent exchange format)data using only ephemeris corrections. For the results, we present the quality of different receiver grades through parametrized error models that are likely to be helpful in stochastic modeling, e.g., for Kalman filters, and in assessing GNSS receiver qualities for crowdsourcing applications. Currently, the typical positioning precision for the latest smartphone receivers is around the decimeter level, while for a professional-grade receiver, it is within a few millimeters.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1404</offset><text>1. Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1420</offset><text>Crowdsourcing possibilities for Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) increase as the amount of GNSS receivers increases, due to an on-going trend of miniaturizing GNSS receiver components and embedding them into various devices such as mobile phones. There are already several examples of crowdsourcing possibilities for GNSS. Research activities are currently being done to perform jamming detection by collecting and processing GNSS signal condition information from a network of GNSS smartphones or inexpensive sensors. Challenges in Arctic navigation may be tackled with a crowdsourcing approach, e.g., ice detection for threat prevention. Furthermore, this work is part of a project aiming to improve weather monitoring in areas not yet covered by sophisticated weather measurement instruments, i.e., a project on tropospheric tomography using smartphone GNSS crowdsourcing.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2306</offset><text>The number of smartphones equipped with chipset GNSS receivers has been experiencing a strong growth over the last few years. About 80% of the sold GNSS devices are installed in smartphones. From the 2017 GSAmarket report, GNSS smartphone receivers are expected to represent more than seven billion devices by 2020. These GNSS crowdsourcing possibilities may, or may not, turn into realities. The least expensive and easiest way to examine the feasibility of the new opportunities is by simulation. These simulations need to be sufficiently accurate in representing realistic situations and therefore must be based on measured data. Especially, it is critical that effective measurement errors be accurately reproduced, for if an error is too large, it directly limits what can be done with the data.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3107</offset><text>Simulations can be done on various levels starting from the molecular level and the study of electric fields, to the level of individual receiver components, to the level of pseudoranges, and on to the level of navigation solutions where the receiver point position can be represented by a Gaussian distribution. Each of these levels offers a different representation of the reality. Here, we limit the focus to the pseudorange level, that is the output that the receiver yields. More precisely, we eliminate the errors caused by atmospheric effects and the satellite clock by using suitable combinations of measurements. Hence, only the errors that originate from the receiver instrumentation are left for our analysis. This is in contrast to the common idea of using combinations of measurements to remove the effect of the receiver instrumentation, e.g.,.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3966</offset><text>The performance level of the instrumentation determines the level of numerical sophistication that can be used in software methodology. For instance, the quality of the receiver clock dictates whether the navigation solutions should be computed separately for each epoch or whether it suffices to model the offset of that clock. Another example is precise point positioning, for which a sufficiently low level of noise in phase observations is crucial. In other words, the level of errors directly influences the level of sophistication, which can be used in the data processing, which in turn determines the feasibility of different crowdsourcing applications.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4628</offset><text>Detailed theoretical models of the standard deviation of both the Delay Lock Loop (DLL) and the Phase Lock Loop (PLL) measurement errors are well known. These models can be extended to cover also the Doppler measurement errors so that both the standard deviation and the bias of Doppler measurement errors are modeled as a function of the Carrier-to-Noise density power ratio (C/N0) and tracking loop architecture and parameters, such as the PLL integration time. These theoretical models are extensively used in assessing the impact of the tracking loop parameters on the code, carrier phase, or Doppler measurements, e.g., for the purpose of designing receivers, and in assessing parameter values when optimizing GNSS receiver architectures. However, these detailed models depend on specific information that is not always available. Information on the receiver architectures and on the tracking loop parameter values for smartphone receivers are generally confidential. Hence, theoretical DLL and PLL error models developed in the literature cannot be used to predict or simulate the DLL and PLL errors for an arbitrary COTS smartphone receiver. This problem is multiplied by the fact that a large crowd of receivers very likely contains several different types of receivers. Hence, the evaluation of receiver-originated errors for individual receivers should not be dependent on a priori information about the design and architecture of these receivers. In other words, there is a need to effectively treat the receiver as a black box.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6168</offset><text>Field measurements can be used for evaluating receiver instrumentation-based errors in a black box fashion when modeling these errors is not feasible. For DLL and PLL errors, estimation by field measurements is done by selecting an appropriate GNSS measurement combination. As an example, the Code Minus Carrier (CMC) combination is extensively used to estimate the standard deviation of the DLL error, which is dominated by multipath in harsh environments. However, this metric is biased since both ionospheric delay and inter-frequency biases affect CMC measurements, and the atmospheric model or dual frequency measurements are needed to eliminate the ionosphere part. Hence, the evaluation of the receiver-originated errors should also be free of any atmospheric modeling, while being available also for single-frequency receivers.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7004</offset><text>The timing fluctuations of the receiver clock are typically characterized using Allan Variance (AVAR), when the clock is studied as a separate entity. If the clock is considered as a part of the receiver, the stability of different smartphone receiver clocks may be estimated in different conditions (such as static, dynamic, open sky, obstructed areas). Then, Allan variance is also suitable for fingerprinting GNSS receivers, when used in combination with feature detection methods. However, the burning question here is not related to the environmental factors, nor to the behavior of the receiver in identifiable events. The question is whether some of the data obtained from a receiver are sufficiently noise-free so that they could be exploited for a given crowdsourcing purpose. To this end, the best available performance of the receiver is a key indicator for application feasibility.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7898</offset><text>In this paper, our main contribution is that we present combinations of measurements for error modeling that can be used to estimate the quality of arbitrary GNSS receivers without atmospheric corrections, nor dual frequency measurements, nor the knowledge about the position of the receiver antenna or its architecture. The receiver is effectively treated as a black box and is assessed via field measurements only, which is a convenient prerequisite when processing crowdsourced data from an anonymous receiver. In detail, we study the best available performance of the receivers in navigation space, i.e., the lower bounds of noise in clock drift and offset, the Delay Lock Loop error (DLL), and the Phase Lock Loop error (PLL). Our work builds heavily on the previous studies, but to our best knowledge, the trinity of combinations and the error models that we present go beyond the ones in the existing literature. For instance, the time series that we use to estimate the low bound for the clock drift do not contain multipathing effects or notable features (see Section 3), which, in contrast, are of primary interest when studying clock stability in different environments or receiver fingerprinting. Furthermore, we extend the use of the CMC time difference metric to develop DLL low-bound error models, while the CMC time difference is a zero-mean metric extensively used for another purpose, namely large code multipath error detection. In addition to describing how to measure the errors, we derive models to simulate these errors that can be used to examine the feasibility of crowdsourcing applications. Furthermore, we provide exemplary parameters to these error models from a field campaign, so that the quality of recent single-frequency multi-constellation (GPS L1, Galileo E1, GLONASS L1) smartphone GNSS receivers can be compared against the quality of higher end GNSS receivers.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9798</offset><text>This paper is written in an introductory manner for a two-fold reasoning. First, the abundance of GNSS receivers has led to them being studied and used by many scholars and engineers. We want to extend our message to a broad audience that is outside the traditional field of navigation, including robotics and mobile mapping, and also to industry. Second, it is highly likely that the development in GNSS receiver technology will continue and that the receivers will keep coming out in various designs, meaning that there will be a continuous need to perform new measurements for new devices. The paper is organized as follows. We lay out the steps to perform these measurements of errors and to model them in Section 2. In Section 3, we describe the field campaign and the data used for the numerical analysis. The error model parameters and the validation of the proposed method is presented in Section 4. After a discussion in Section 5, we conclude the paper.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>10762</offset><text>2.

Receiver Functionality and the Correlation of SomeÂ Errors</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10891</offset><text>In order to obtain observables, a GNSS receiver generates a code and a carrier replica signal using application-specific hardware blocks, so-called Numerically-Controlled Oscillators (NCOs). These NCOs are essentially incremental counters and use the receiver clock crystal, typically a TCXO (temperature controlled crystal oscillator)or an OCXO (oven controlled crystal oscillator), to generate a signal that matches the incoming signal from the satellites. Then, the so-called correlators are implemented in software or hardware to generate the amplitude of the correlation function between the incoming signal and the replica generated in the receiver.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>11547</offset><text>The output from these correlators is provided to code and carrier discriminators that in turn will generate an error estimate, i.e., how much is the difference between the incoming signal and the replica. These errors are then filtered and used as a control input for the NCOs. The loop filters are often referred to as the DLL (Delay Lock Loop) used for controlling the code NCO and the PLL (Phase Lock Loop) used for controlling the carrier NCO. If the replica is found to be slightly delayed, the NCO speed will be increased and vice versa.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>12091</offset><text>All of these components, the NCOs, correlators, discriminators, and loop filters, form a closed-loop system for tracking each signal received from the satellites. Each signal has its own set of NCOs, correlators, discriminators, and loop filters, but the receiver only has one clock that provides the reference for all the NCOs. All the above components will contribute to the overall error in the observables. The NCO will for example have quantization errors due to their discrete nature. This error depends largely on the sampling frequency. A higher sampling frequency results in a smaller error. The DLL and PLL filters have a predetermined bandwidth and update rate, which both affect the size of the error in the replica alignment. The lower the bandwidth is and the higher the sampling frequency is, the more accurate the filters are.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>12934</offset><text>In this text, we refer to the DLL and PLL error as the sum of the errors from all the above components, except the clock. The PLL and DLL errors are to a large extent independent of each other, i.e., the errors in these two channels are uncorrelated. The clock, however, is common for all NCOs, and its errors are therefore highly correlated over all channels.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>13295</offset><text>2.2.

This is because the instrumental, atmospheric, satellite-based, and environmental errors are all contained within the same measurement observables. In order to separate these errors, we look into the combinations of measurements and introduce the concepts of correlated and uncorrelated errors. Note that in Equations (1) and (2), the correlated error, , is the same for both carrier and code and for all channels, whereas the uncorrelated errors,  and , depend on the satellite . This idea goes beyond the standard combinations that are well known in the literature, e.g., the two satellitesâ difference, but has an opposite interest. We want to determine the receiver properties, while the interest in the two satellitesâ difference is in removing the receiver dependency for relative positioning purposes (see Ch. 21.5.2 in).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>15254</offset><text>2.4.

If the receiver clock has a limited oscillation stability, the offset between the receiver clock and the system time needs to be re-estimated for each observation epoch or eliminated by processing differences between simultaneous observations. On the other hand, when the receiver clock has a high oscillation stability, the offset between the receiver clock and the system time can be modeled.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>15838</offset><text>The navigation solution in a GNSS receiver is typically obtained using a Least Squares Estimator (LSE) or more advanced filtering techniques like the Kalman filter. Using these advanced filters allows for the use of a prediction step in the state estimation, which is especially useful when data from multiple sensors are combined to assist in the positioning. Here, as we only use data from a single GNSS receiver at a time, we retain the simpler LSE approach. In order to obtain maximal precision for our clock offset estimate, we rely on the more accurate carrier phase measurements and, thus, actually estimate the clock offset through the velocity LSE using clock drift, , which is the time derivative of the clock offset. For a discussion on different techniques, see.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>16613</offset><text>To obtain the clock drift for each constellation at a discrete time  (), we write the Doppler term: which eliminates biases that are very slowly varying with respect to time (such as atmospheric delays) and use a simple LSE: to solve the unknowns , where v stands for velocity. In Equation (4), the expectation terms  are calculated for a static receiver and moving satellites. To this end, receiver position is obtained from the standard position LSE calculated using pseudo-ranges, and satellite movement is obtained from the navigation message. Intuitively, if the receiver would be error-free, we would obtain  from Equation (4), since the receiver is kept static during the measurement. However, as the receiver is not error-free, we obtain time-series for the clock drift.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>17392</offset><text>The receiver clock imposes the same error on all clock drifts regardless of the constellation.

Remember that in the Methods section, we left as an open question whether the slow and fast component of the clock drift in Equation (5) can be separated. In Figure 3a,c,e, the clock drift is clearly separable, , even for the smartphone receiver. This means that our assumptions related to the combination of measurements and the respective clock model hold. Here, the slow component is represented with a fourth order polynomial, which are commonly used in Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) receivers for similar numerical purposes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28513</offset><text>The fast component, which we were interested in, showed small 0.1â0.4-m/s noise in Figure 3b. These data, when without temporal correlations, can be modeled with a normal distribution, such as the rightmost term in Equation (7). The temporal oscillations of the fast component, however, required further analysis. Here, we performed an exemplary analysis of the u-blox data shown in Figure 3b, by calculating an autocorrelation function using Equation (24); see Figure 4. The autocorrelation function obtained from the fast clock drift followed the form of the following model function: where the constants for the u-blox receiver with the patch antenna are , , and . In other words, the receiver clock exhibits a repetitive error that has a characteristic cycle of about  m/s, or dividing by the speed of light, a cycle of about  ns in the time domain. These oscillations that have a large magnitude were due to interference between the signal replica and the incoming signal, telling us about the free-running frequency of the crystal. Note that the autocorrelation function of Equation (26) for the clock drift is similar to, but simpler than the one predicted by Winkel for the DLL and PLL oscillations; see Equation (25). We shall see whether the DLL and PLL observations exhibit this same behavior. However, before we do this, we shall write out a clock offset model that encompasses both the random walk and the temporal correlations as follows: where , k enumerates discrete time steps of length , the constants a and  that are GNSS receiver specific are obtained from Equation (26), and  that is also GNSS receiver specific is obtained from Equation (6).

The autocorrelation functions calculated from the fast component data, shown in Figure 5c,f,i, exhibit the temporal behavior of white noise. Therefore, we can conclude that the DLL error model of Equation (18) is adequate for simulation purposes. The variance of the normal distribution, , is obtained from the fast component, i.e., the time series shown in Figure 5b,e,h. In Figure 5b, the time series shows an up-down peak, i.e., an anomaly, that we conserved for visualization purposes. Otherwise, the times series used for the DLL and PLL analyses did not contain such anomalies and thus represented the lower bound for errors.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>31146</offset><text>The PLL noise in the carrier phase is analyzed using Equation (11), and exemplary results are shown in Figure 6a,d,g. For the u-blox receiver in (d), we can see that the phase noise is within  cm. The fast component is shown in Figure 6e, and it is further analyzed by calculating the autocorrelation function; see Figure 6f. The autocorrelation function reveals no anomalous components. However, the validity of our assumptions requires further testing. The proposed PLL-related error model of Equation (23) employs a single normal distribution even though the combination of measurements of Equation (21) used to estimate its parameters uses data from two different satellites. Therefore, we examine the distribution of the measured observable (see Figure 7) and see that it is close to a Gaussian shape. Therefore, we conclude that using a normal distribution in Equation (23) is valid for simulating the phase noise caused by the receiver instrumentation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>32106</offset><text>4.3.

Huawei P10 did not track any Galileo satellites, and Samsung S8 tracked only one, so the appropriate columns are marked with Not Available (N/A). This happened despite the most suitable hour of the week being selected from the satellite almanac in terms of satellite visibility. A maximum of nine Galileo satellites were visible during the time of measurement, which is a large amount near Helsinki, Finland. From the results of Table 1, we can observe that the smartphones studied here, Huawei P10 and Samsung S8, have a clock of similar quality as the u-blox receiver. However, the smartphones suffer from DLL and PLL noise levels that are over one level of magnitude higher, and this is what makes them inferior in positioning compared to the u-blox receiver. One major cause for this is without a doubt the antenna, as the smartphones have only small integrated antennas.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>33121</offset><text>The two u-blox receivers using separate antennas seem to output a similar level of noise; see Table 1.

This lower bound can be seen to represent a feasibility threshold for crowdsourcing applications, i.e., if an application would require a higher performance than what is available in open sky conditions for certain equipment, that application is not feasible with that equipment. On the other hand, if the performance requirements for the feasibility are lower than what is the measured performance of certain equipment in open sky conditions, that equipment may contribute to the successful implementation of that application.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>35246</offset><text>For DLL and PLL errors, we used the satellite signals with the highest signal to noise ratio, . Even in environments where multipathing is present, such as in our semi-urban experiments, this signal is typically obtained from a straight line-of-sight observation. However, if the signal contains multipathing, the central assumptions for the models of Equations (18) and (23) are violated. This can be seen as a limitation of the proposed method. Furthermore, another limitation is that the quality of the time series with respect to this ratio can only be verified in the post-processing phase, so online measurements are not feasible. In the future, it would be interesting to establish the link between  and the variance of the thermal DLL and PLL noise. The signal-to-noise ratio  likely depends, e.g., on the satellite elevation angle and also on the antenna quality if signal receiving conditions are degraded.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>36163</offset><text>In our study, the time series were at most one hour long.

Here, we studied this offset indirectly using Equations (6) and (7). This offset is not a constant, but an unknown function whose time development depends on the instrumentation properties and changes in the temperature. Temperature changes can occur in a receiver when the outside temperature changes, the receiver is heating up after start-up, and when the power consumption changes due to some part of the receiver becoming active and generating heat. A typical such part is the signal acquisition block that activates on a regular basis and usually consumes several mA of power.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>37455</offset><text>If the receiver is prone to exhibit frequent cycle slips, the effect of these cycle slips are incorporated into the estimated (low-bound) error for the clock drift.

For consumer-grade receivers that have integrated antennas such as smartphones, this is a real challenge, as the exact location of the antenna is unknown. Furthermore, the separation of errors originating from the receiver and those originating from the atmosphere is crucial for this kind of error analysis. Here, we laid out the equations for combinations of measurements needed to assess the level of quality of smartphone GNSS receivers, developed models on how these (low bound) errors can be simulated, and then performed field experiments to verify that the assumptions made for the proposed methods do hold. Using GPS L1, Galileo E1, and GLONASS L1 signals, exemplary parameter values for the proposed error models were presented for low-, medium-, and high-grade GNSS receivers. Our methodology is straightforwardly applicable also to multi-frequency GNSS receivers, including smartphones.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>39779</offset><text>Based on our results, we conclude that the noise that originated from instruments and showed in code and carrier phase measurements, i.e., DLL and PLL, had negligible time-dependent components and can be modeled as white noise.
