The ability to accurately delineate tissue regions can provide important information for computational diagnosis, prognostication, assessments of treatment response and investigations of cancer biology. The problem of semantic segmentation, or exhaustive pixel-level classification of tissues, is particularly challenging. While deep-learning methods have demonstrated promising results in general semantic image segmentation problems, these encoder-decoder convolutional architectures require large training datasets to generalize well. Generating annotated histology datasets with adequate scale presents significant challenges, especially when careful delineation of regions or structures is required, and the lack of annotated histology remains a significant barrier in the growth of computational pathology. Semantic segmentation is particularly challenging, as complete labeling of the scene is required. Generating a meaningful number of annotations requires engaging with multiple experts, and even experienced pathologists will exhibit some inter-rater discordance. Annotations need to be captured on many images, as remarkable histologic variations can be observed even within a single lab, and variations in tissue processing (fixation, staining, mounting) and imaging have a strong influence on image texture and color. Data augmentation techniques are often used when training networks to simulate this variation by artificially manipulating the color and contrast of images with some success, reducing the annotation burden. Still, a pathologist with significant clinical demands often cannot produce enough annotations on their own to adequately train deep-learning models for challenging applications like semantic segmentation. Interfaces for viewing and annotating whole-slide histology images, collaborative review and data management are also a critical element in engaging pathologists to scale the production of accurate ground truth.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3453</offset><text>Crowdsourcing has been extensively used in general non-medical tasks, and has been shown to markedly speed and scale the process of image annotation. In the life sciences, crowd-based approaches based on gamification or micropayments enabled successful scaling of biological annotations. In pathology, however, the value of crowdsourcing is not immediately apparent due to the complexity and subjectivity of tasks, scale of whole-slide scans (necessitating custom large-scale viewers and annotation platforms), and domain expertise needed; a recent systematic review found that almost all crowdsourcing articles in the pathology literature focused on malaria diagnosis and relatively simple scoring of immunohistochemical biomarkers. Recent work has established the value of crowdsourcing for nucleus detection and segmentation microtasks in hematoxylin and eosin stained images, and that research fellows and some non-pathologists (NPs) are able to reach acceptable concordance with senior pathologists (SPs). This work was based on a limited number of slides (10), focused on small regions of interest (400×400 up to 800×800 pixels), and did not explore more challenging tasks such as semantic segmentation. Moreover, this work did not investigate how to organize participants and leverage their various experience levels, and how technology can facilitate feedback and collaboration between more and less experienced participants to improve crowdsourcing efficiency and accuracy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4938</offset><text>To address some of these issues, we investigate the use of crowdsourcing in the context of semantic segmentation of breast cancer images. This task is widely regarded as the most laborious and challenging type of ground truth generation. We describe our experience using web-based technology to facilitate an international crowdsourcing effort, and in expanding this effort to include junior pathology residents (JPs) and medical students. We also describe how training and directed feedback using web-based tools like the Digital Slide Archive (DSA) can be instrumental in streamlining the annotation and review process. Our annotation efforts focus on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), an aggressive genomic subtype that comprises ∼15% of breast cancer cases.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>5706</offset><text>2 Materials and methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>5730</offset><text>2.1 Dataset description</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5754</offset><text>The dataset used in this study consists of 151 hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images (WSIs) corresponding to 151 histologically-confirmed breast cancer cases. These images of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues were acquired from the Cancer Genome Atlas, with triple-negative status determined from clinical data files. A representative region of interest (ROI) was selected within each slide by the study coordinator, a medical doctor, and approved by a SP. The mean ROI size was 1.18 mm2 (SD = 0.80 mm2). ROIs were selected to be representative of predominant region classes and textures within each slide. Very large ROIs were avoided to prevent degradation in quality due to participant fatigue. Regions with high tumor density were selected whenever possible, for two reasons: (i) to maximize the proportion of ROI occupied by tumor; (ii) to minimize the need to distinguish normal/inflammatory cells and cancerous tissue, an exhaustive process requiring expertise not expected from NPs.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>6769</offset><text>2.2 Participant recruitment and training</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6810</offset><text>The study workflow is illustrated in Figure 1. Research interest groups on social media (including Facebook and LinkedIn) were used to recruit participants, who were asked to submit a resume and brief motivation statement to the study coordinator. A total of 25 participants, including 20 medical students, 3 JPs and 2 SPs were selected during recruitment. Throughout this manuscript, we use the following notation to denote the various participant classes: SP (senior resident or faculty); JP; NP. JPs were defined as pathology residents who have not finished their second year of residency training. Participants underwent a training session, composed of introductory videos and a detailed document describing guidelines, histological patterns to annotate, common pitfalls as well as instructions for using the DSA interface. Supplementary Table S1 illustrates sample instructions provided to participants to help improve and standardize the annotation process. Slack, an online team communication tool, was used for NPs to ask questions and to receive feedback from other participants and pathologists. Extensive feedback was provided on the first slide annotated by a participant, serving as a de-facto practical component of their training. </text></passage><passage><infon key="file">btz083f1.jpg</infon><infon key="id">btz083-F1</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>8058</offset><text>Study overview.

Each class has a style that defines the rendering properties for its annotations including class names and boundary colors. These styles were pre-defined in a template by the study coordinator in consultation with an SP, and serve to improve the consistency of annotations across participants and to facilitate review.

(ii) Non-predominant classes including artifacts, adipose tissue, blood vessels, blood (intravascular or extravasated red blood cells), glandular secretions and extracellular mucoid material and (iii) challenging classes including plasma cells, mixed inflammatory infiltrates (e.g. neutrophils), normal ducts or acini, metaplastic changes (osteoid matrix, cartilaginous metaplasia, etc.), lymph vessels, skin adnexa, angioinvasion and nerves. Since stroma is the most prevalent component in many slides, it was considered to be the ‘default’ class and defined by absence of annotations. JPs and NPs were directed to focus their effort on annotating predominant classes and to ask for feedback on Slack when annotating non-predominant or challenging classes. Providing feedbacks publicly on the Slack channel allowed all participants to access and learn from each other’s questions and responses. The study coordinator and SPs reviewed all annotations for mistakes using two mechanisms: (i) providing feedback to the participants on the Slack channel and (ii) generating new correction overlay annotations that are patched on top of the original annotations (Supplementary Fig. S1). Two phases of review and corrections were used (Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig. S3).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>13487</offset><text>2.6 Measuring annotation discordance</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>13524</offset><text>The polygonal coordinates are queried using the DSA server REST API and are converted to a mask image format offline, where pixel values encode region class (Supplementary Fig S1).

Our analysis makes comparisons on the effect of experience level and feedback on annotation quality. We used two techniques to visualize discordance between participants. The first is a bi-clustered heatmap of the inter-participant discordance matrix that groups participants based on discordance profiles. The second is a multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis of the discordance matrix that depicts participants as points in two-dimensional space and where proximity indicates concordance.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>14601</offset><text>2.7 Semantic segmentation and classification models</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>14653</offset><text>A pre-trained fully convolutional VGG-16, FCN-8 network was trained to segment histology images into five classes: tumor, stroma, inflammatory infiltrates, necrosis and other classes.

Focusing on the 125 ROIs from infiltrating ductal carcinomas [the majority of TNBCs ], we first applied color normalization to the RGB images of the ROIs. Several different types of models were trained to evaluate different aspects of crowdsourcing:</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>15198</offset><text>Firstly, to investigate the effects of using crowdsourced versus single-expert annotations for training, we trained ‘comparison’ models for semantic segmentation.

Since training hundreds of semantic segmentation models is time prohibitive, we instead trained classification models based on the pre-trained VGG-16 network to classify 224×224 pixel patches from the three predominant classes: tumor, stroma and inflammatory infiltration, using the same train/test assignment used in the semantic segmentation model (see details in Supplementary Methods).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>16735</offset><text>3 Results</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>16745</offset><text>Our study produced a total of 50 057 polygonal annotations, including 3988 corrections.

While ALs are demonstrating diagnostically meaningful performance in many applications, large amounts of annotations are required to develop and validate these models. This necessitates engaging multiple participants in annotation studies, and the ability to efficiently organize participants with a range of experience levels is one approach to scaling the annotation process. While significant expertise is needed for accurate semantic annotation of histology, our study provides an example application where non-experts can be trained to effectively perform much of the time-consuming work.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>24875</offset><text>While non-experts cannot be expected to recognize rare patterns or to accurately annotate difficult cases, a large majority of the work in delineating tissue boundaries does not fall in these categories. By utilizing expertise where it is needed, in the annotation of rare or difficult classes, and in reviewing and correcting the annotations of non-experts, we were able to produce a large dataset containing over 20 000 annotated tissue regions. This resource can be used to train semantic segmentation models for breast cancer histology to characterize the tumor microenvironment and inflammatory infiltration, both of which are known to strongly correlate with cancer progression and patient outcomes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>25582</offset><text>The annotations in our study were produced using the DSA, a web-based digital pathology platform. While DSA provides a wide array of annotation tools, future development will enhance review and collaboration capabilities by formalizing these processes in specialized interfaces. These enhancements will increase the utility of DSA for annotation studies, education and diagnostic review including tumor boards.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>25993</offset><text>Although concordance among participants was generally strong, important sources of discordance between SPs and NPs were observed (Supplementary Fig. S4). In the predominant classes, discordance was often observed in cases where judgment was either difficult or subjectively defined (e.g. a region is lymphocyte-rich if at least 80% of its area was occupied by lymphocytes). Less frequently occurring non-predominant classes were also often missed by NP participants, likely due to difficulty in recognizing these classes and a lack of training. Examples of annotation errors include stromal regions being mislabeled as necrosis or vice versa, hyalinized or acellular stroma misclassified as mucinous change, plasma cells being mislabeled as lymphocytes, and endothelial cells, activated fibroblasts or activated histiocytes being mislabeled as tumor. Missed classes include blood vessels, glandular secretions, as well as rare metaplastic changes and non-lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrates (it should be noted that much of the discordance arises from non-predominant classes added by the SPs during correction). We provide further evidence of the utility of NP annotations, showing that comparison models derived from NP annotations had similar accuracy to models derived from SP annotations. These comparison experiments were based on the limited set of ROIs for which both SP and NP annotations were available, and hence we still recommend supervision and feedback by SPs following the initial training of NP participants.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27520</offset><text>Semantic segmentation models derived from our annotation dataset were highly accurate, and provide new opportunities for feature extraction from breast cancer histology and tissue based studies. These models have a high macro-average AUC (0.897) and class-wise AUCs ranging from 0.881 (stroma) to 0.941 (inflammatory). Visualization shows that many of the areas where the human and computational prediction disagree is due to increased sensitivity of the models to granular regions that are not annotated by human participants.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28048</offset><text>While our study presents important findings on annotating histology images, there are a number of research questions that were not addressed. Our study relied on medical students and graduates, with the rationale being that basic familiarity with histology and general biology may reduce error rates. Future studies may investigate whether this assumption is correct, and if it is possible to engage a broader pool of participants that lack this training to further scale annotation efforts. Our study also did not evaluate intra-participant discordance, an issue that is known to be significant in pathology. Measuring intra-participant discordance would provide a baseline to evaluate inter-participant discordances against, and would provide better context for the differences in discordance observed among and between participants with different experience levels. The time participants spent in making annotations was also not recorded, nor was the time that more experienced users spent correcting annotations. This information, while difficult to acquire reliably, could provide further insights on how to best allocate resources in structured crowdsourcing studies. Finally, we would point out that the value of crowdsourcing likely varies by application. The amount of data required varies with the difficulty of the prediction task, whether the model is expected to generalize to specimens from different institutions, expectations for prediction model accuracy and the availability of experts to produce annotations. In some tasks, a well-resourced organization may be able to engage their pathologists to produce sufficient annotations for ‘in-house’ models not intended to generalize to specimens generated at other labs.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ACK_FUND</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>29787</offset><text>Funding</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ACK_FUND</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>29795</offset><text>This work was supported by the U.S. National Institutes of Health; and National Cancer Institute grants [U01CA220401, U24CA194362].</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ACK_FUND</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>29927</offset><text> Conflict of Interest: Ventana did not fund this study, but they are funding others.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>30012</offset><text>Supplementary Material</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>30035</offset><text>References</text></passage><passage><infon key="fpage">2.</infon><infon key="name_0">surname:Alialy;given-names:R.</infon><infon key="pub-id_pmid">29531847</infon><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="source">J.
