It has been suspected that infected persons who remain asymptomatic play a significant role in the ongoing pandemic, but their relative number and effect have been uncertain. The authors sought to review and synthesize the available evidence on asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Asymptomatic persons seem to account for approximately 40% to 45% of SARS-CoV-2 infections, and they can transmit the virus to others for an extended period, perhaps longer than 14 days. Asymptomatic infection may be associated with subclinical lung abnormalities, as detected by computed tomography. Because of the high risk for silent spread by asymptomatic persons, it is imperative that testing programs include those without symptoms. To supplement conventional diagnostic testing, which is constrained by capacity, cost, and its one-off nature, innovative tactics for public health surveillance, such as crowdsourcing digital wearable data and monitoring sewage sludge, might be helpful.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>1232</offset><text>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly throughout the world.

This is the deadly face of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which as of 26 May 2020 had claimed more than 348 000 lives worldwide.

In some cases, the viral load of such asymptomatic persons has been equal to that of symptomatic persons, suggesting similar potential for viral transmission. The prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, however, has remained uncertain. We sought to review and synthesize the available evidence on testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection, carried out by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction using nasopharyngeal swabs in all studies that specified the method of testing.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3438</offset><text>Most data from the 16 cohorts in this narrative review are not the output of large, carefully designed studies with randomly selected, representative samples. They do not generally purport to depict anything more than certain circumscribed cohorts at specific moments in time. We have not attempted to pool them for the purposes of statistical analysis. When viewed as a collection, though—as a kind of mosaic or patchwork—these data may offer potentially valuable insights into SARS-CoV-2 incidence and the highly variable effect of infection.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3987</offset><text>The difficulty of distinguishing asymptomatic persons from those who are merely presymptomatic is a stumbling block. To be clear, the asymptomatic individual is infected with SARS-CoV-2 but will never develop symptoms of COVID-19. In contrast, the presymptomatic individual is similarly infected but eventually will develop symptoms. The simple solution to this conundrum is longitudinal testing—that is, repeated observations of the individual over time. Unfortunately, only 5 of our cohorts include longitudinal data. We must therefore acknowledge the possibility that some of the proportions of asymptomatic persons are lower than reported.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>4633</offset><text>Methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4641</offset><text>From 19 April through 26 May 2020, using the keywords COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, symptoms, and asymptomatic, we periodically searched the published medical literature using the PubMed service maintained by the U.S. National Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health.

According to the researchers, in the roughly 2-week period between the sampling efforts, none of the asymptomatic persons developed any symptoms of COVID-19. In addition, through contact tracing, they confirmed that several new cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection that appeared during the second sampling had been caused by exposure to asymptomatic persons. In Vo' during the 14-day period studied, young children seemed to play no role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2: “No infections were detected in either survey in 234 tested children ranging from 0 to 10 years, despite some of them living in the same household as infected people”.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>7148</offset><text> Diamond Princess </text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7167</offset><text>On 3 February 2020, the Diamond Princess cruise ship returned to Yokohama, Japan, for quarantine, having transferred an ill passenger to shore in Hong Kong on 25 January who later tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.

In a locked-down congregate setting like a prison, it seems possible that contagious respiratory viruses could spread rapidly, so it would be interesting to do a serosurvey for antibodies to these betacoronaviruses. Still, 96% is very high. It would be prudent to review the source data carefully for errors.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>21692</offset><text>What individual differences might account for why 2 persons of the same age, sex, and health status, for example, have idiosyncratic responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection? Why does one come through with nary a symptom, while the other lies near death in intensive care? At the moment, we simply do not know. If ever there were a need for precision medicine—for deeply and thoroughly understanding the multitudinous “-omics” that shape each of us—this is it. Perhaps there will be not just 1 therapy or vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 but versions that are individualized to maximize their efficacy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>22286</offset><text>In countries like the United States that have been hardest hit by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, it has been apparent for some time that the amount of testing must be significantly and rapidly increased—perhaps by an order of magnitude or more. With this new knowledge that a large proportion of those infected with SARS-CoV-2 have no symptoms, the urgency for more testing becomes even greater.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>22678</offset><text>In a perfect world, perhaps using simple, accurate, inexpensive technology that is still on the drawing board, we would test each person every day for SARS-CoV-2. Until that is possible, innovative surveillance tactics might provide useful data for public health officials. Self-monitoring with internet-connected thermometers and smart watches that monitor heart rate, then crowdsourcing the resulting data, has been shown to accurately predict the incidence of influenza-like illness as reported by the California Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Similarly, monitoring sewage sludge provided “SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations [that] were a seven-day leading indicator ahead of compiled COVID-19 testing data and led local hospital admissions data by three days”.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>23491</offset><text>The early data that we have assembled on the prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection suggest that this is a significant factor in the rapid progression of the COVID-19 pandemic.
