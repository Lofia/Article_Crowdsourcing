The success of these platforms depends in no small part on their ability to attract and retain participants, turning diffuse crowds of users into active and productive communities. This article investigates how the collectives of online citizen science are formed and governed, and identifies two ideal-types of government, either based on self-interest or on universal norms of science. Based on an ethnography of three citizen science platforms and a series of interviews with their managers, we show how different technologies – rhetorical, of the self, social, and ontological – can be diversely combined to configure these collectives. We suggest that the shift from individual projects to platforms is a defining moment for online citizen science, during which the technologies that sustain the collectives are standardized and automatized in ways that make the crowd appear to be a natural community.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1131</offset><text>‘Citizen science’ is an actor’s category that has been assertively taken up by the media and more recently by science funding and science policy agencies. It designates a wide range of practices, from citizens donating the processing power of their personal computer to perform scientific calculations (SETI@home from BOINC), to amateur naturalists collecting observational data about birds (eBird), to people analyzing light curve graphs in search of potential exoplanets (Planet Hunters from Zooniverse), to patients sharing quantified observations, symptoms, and experiences about their health (PatientsLikeMe), to biohackers attempting to produce insulin in a community laboratory (Counter Culture Labs).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1846</offset><text>Analysts of citizen science, who are often active promoters of the field, have attempted to make sense of such a diverse set of practices by asking, for example, what motivates the participants in citizen science projects, how power is distributed between professional and amateur participants (; ; ), how participation is shaped by the spaces in which amateur activities take place or how these activities embody different epistemic practices, each with a distinct genealogy. This article introduces another analytic perspective to the study of citizen science by shifting the focus away from power, individual motivations, and the spaces and epistemic practices of citizen science, toward the constitution of participatory collectives. Throughout the article, we use the term ‘collective’ to refer to any kind of group that takes part in citizen science. In our usage, ‘collective’ is an abstract and general term that, unlike ‘community’, does not imply any a priori assumption regarding the nature and composition of the group, or the strength of its bonds. Although, as we show in the article, non-human actors certainly play a role in the constitution of the collectives of online citizen science, we are using the term to refer only to human collectives.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3120</offset><text>In our focus on the collectives engaged in the production of scientific knowledge in citizen science, we ask the questions: How are these collectives constituted and maintained? How are they portrayed and labeled? How are they governed? What kinds of social forms emerge out of citizen science? This study will not only contribute to our understanding of citizen science but also, more generally, to the transformation of crowds of individuals into online communities.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3589</offset><text>We explore these questions by looking at a specific, yet numerically important (involving several million participants) subset of citizen science – projects that take place exclusively online, are usually set up by mostly academic scientists and request participants to compute or analyze scientific data. Compared with other kinds of citizen science, such as ‘social movement-based citizen science’, often focused on issues of environmental justice or on biomedical research, where the collectives take their starting point in pre-existing local communities that are strengthened and enlarged by the project, online citizen science aggregates individual volunteers who share a common interest but do not (yet) constitute a stable collective. When patient-based citizen science takes place primarily online, for example on the platform PatientsLikeMe, communities appear to emerge out of the very process of individual volunteers engaging in citizen science, rather than the opposite. This also tends to be the case in hybrid contexts, for example in naturalist citizen science projects which do not rely on pre-existing communities, such as birders, but organize field activities for participants and also crucially depend on online databases.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4840</offset><text>Instead of surveying all kinds of citizen science in order to produce yet another typology of it – this time in terms of the collectives engaged in, transformed by, and established through citizen science – we choose to focus on and compare three online citizen science projects – SETI@home, GalaxyZoo, EyeWire – for which the formation of durable collectives appears to be especially challenging and fragile. Indeed, such projects rarely draw on pre-existing, offline collectives such as local communities of amateur scientists. Instead, they gather what has been characterized as ‘crowds’ – a term which has been quite successful in ‘figuring the collective’ at play in the digital world since the 2010s. Referring to both a large and diffuse mass of individuals, the crowd has recently been called on to represent the collectives of online citizen science; some authors now speak of ‘citizen crowd science’ or simply ‘crowd science’.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5803</offset><text>In these distributed computing and crowdsourcing projects, scientific questions are broken down into repetitive micro-tasks that human and non-human crowds are asked to process. Unlike better-known crowdsourcing endeavors, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, participants on citizen science platforms receive no remuneration in exchange for the tasks they perform, raising the question of what sustains the collectives of online citizen science. This article shows how citizen science platforms enroll crowds of volunteers and turn them into active and industrious collectives, in the name of science. The crowd then takes on a new (ideal) form, that of the community, defined by stability, shared values, and self-organization. This article thus speaks more generally to the social construction of online communities in the digital age.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6637</offset><text>To show how such a process is achieved, the article presents case studies of three different citizen science projects and platforms, based on various types of sources: An ethnography/participant observation of three projects/platforms, semi-structured interviews with the founders and managers of the projects and an exploration of the literature from the fields of psychology and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) that engage with the projects, a literature that we treat as a primary source. The three projects/platforms have different genealogies and they elicit different kinds of participation from their users. 1 </text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7256</offset><text>The first project, SETI@home, was launched in 1999 at UC Berkeley and rapidly reached iconic status. The project uses the idle cycles of the participants’ computers to perform scientific calculations on astronomical radio signals, in the hope of finding signs of extraterrestrial intelligence. The process, known as ‘distributed computing’, consists of dividing large calculations into small tasks distributed among many computers. In the 1990s, thanks to the increasing speed of networks and popularity of personal computers, this approach was becoming a viable alternative to performing these calculations on a centralized supercomputer. In 2004, SETI@home was integrated into a broader platform for science-related distributed computing projects called BOINC (Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing). In 2020, the project entered a ‘hibernation’ phase, with no new tasks being distributed. The second project, GalaxyZoo, was launched in 2007 at Oxford University and has participants analyze and classify images of galaxies according to their shape. In 2009, it was integrated into the platform Zooniverse, which hosts other crowdsourcing projects in many fields of the natural sciences and the humanities. Finally, EyeWire was launched in 2012 at Princeton University, as a science game in which the users engage in complex 3D-mapping of neurons from 2D electron microscopic images. It is expected to form the basis of a platform for citizen science games about the brain, called Neo, yet to be launched. 2 </text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>8790</offset><text>To explore how the collectives of online citizen science are constituted and governed, we first present the three case studies in more detail, highlighting what kinds of user experience the projects/platforms offer to their participants, whether in terms of navigating the website, performing the tasks, reflecting on one’s activity or connecting with other users. We then build on these results in order to characterize, at the level of the participants, the different technologies that configure the social forms of citizen science, that is, turning crowds into communities. These technologies can be diversely combined, but they ultimately point to two ideal-types of government, either based on self-interest or on shared norms (of science). Finally, moving to the level of the architecture and infrastructure of the collectives, we analyze the constant human and non-human mediation work involved by the technologies of crowd governing. We show how the shift from projects to platforms can be seen as a way of automatizing and, ultimately, invisibilizing this mediation work so as to make the crowd appear as a natural community.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>9927</offset><text>Experiencing the interface</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>9954</offset><text>SETI@home/BOINC</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9970</offset><text>Welcome to &lt;https://setiathome.berkeley.edu&gt;! The website may look a bit old fashioned in 2021, but SETI@home still exists. ‘You can participate by running a free program that downloads and analyzes radio telescope data’. Once installed on your computer, this program, called BOINC manager, allows you to choose between different projects – some dedicated to astronomy (Milkyway@home), others to physics (LHC@home), biology (Rosetta@home), or climate science (Climateprediction.net). The interface of the BOINC manager is rather rudimentary (see Figure 1a); still, in addition to providing a short description of the project for which you are computing, it will display a bar showing your progress (35.719%, for now) in completing a ‘task’ or ‘work unit’. It will also remind you of the total ‘work’ you have dedicated to the project (21,723 in arbitrary units), information you can also access by looking at your account on the project website (where ‘work’ significantly becomes ‘credit’). External websites run by volunteers, such as BOINCstats, will also provide you with plenty of statistics on your activity. This information is public, so that you can easily compare your achievements to those of others. If you are in the top 1%, 10%, or 25% for recent average credits, you will also distinguish yourself with, respectively, gold, silver, and bronze ‘badges’.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">10.1177_03063127211058791-fig1.jpg</infon><infon key="id">fig1-03063127211058791</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>11368</offset><text>(a) BOINC manager (running SETI@home) and (b) SETI@home

You will classify galaxies (GalaxyZoo), search for exoplanets (Planet Hunters), transcribe nineteenth-century ship’s logs (Old Weather) or identify animals in millions of camera trap images (Snapshot Serengeti). Each project offers a distinct interface, but the process is always the same. Let us try GalaxyZoo (see Figure 2). What appears on your computer or smartphone screen is an image featuring at least one galaxy in the center; your mission is to classify this galaxy, with the help of a series of questions that ask you to specify and further refine your choice. If the galaxy is ‘simply smooth’, would you say that it is ‘completely round’, ‘cigar shaped’ or in between? Do you see something odd, such as a ring or a merger? And so forth. Apparently, you are better at this pattern recognition task than some of the most powerful computers on earth (at least for now, because your classifications are being used to train AI algorithms further).</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">10.1177_03063127211058791-fig2.jpg</infon><infon key="id">fig2-03063127211058791</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>13996</offset><text>GalaxyZoo: Classifying galaxies.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>14029</offset><text>On Zooniverse, unlike BOINC, there is no need to register if you just want to make classifications.

Feedback is quantitative, not qualitative: You will learn how many classifications you have performed, but not how well you performed them (which can be known only a posteriori, when enough classifications of the same question have been made to allow for comparison and computation of the ‘right’ answer). However, you are always offered the opportunity, through the ‘Talk’ function, to discuss an image with your fellow classifiers. On this social space, with their help, you might even make a big discovery, as did the Dutch schoolteacher Hanny van Arkel, who observed in 2007 a quasar ionization echo now known as ‘Hanny’s Voorwerp’ (; : 130–133). Importantly, you can only perform tasks individually, not as part of a team, even if from time to time Zooniverse will advertise short-term collective goals, such as ‘Let’s collectively classify at least X galaxies in the next Y hours!’</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>15305</offset><text>EyeWire</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>15313</offset><text>Tired of classifying galaxies?

Once you’ve passed the tutorial, cubes will be ‘artifacts’, and then, if you go on performing well, ‘relics’, and you’ll be able to ‘trailblaze’ cubes (i.e. be the first person to trace a cube). Your performance or ‘stats’ will be closely monitored (both in terms of points and ‘accuracy’ – how well you traced a cube) and made publicly available, so that everyone can compare – and compete! Users can also enter temporary teams and participate in collective competitions (e.g. Stripes vs Spots in June 2020). Communication spaces are also important: Alongside the traditional forum, an in-game chat will allow you to discuss with other players online, asking them for advice and support (or anything else). Finally, a regularly updated blog, run by the EyeWire HQ and featuring illustrations inspired by sci-fi and heroic fantasy, will keep you on track with the latest developments in the game.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>17258</offset><text>Interfaces</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>17269</offset><text>By describing the interfaces of these three platforms in terms of the general experience of the participant (navigating the platform, performing tasks, measuring one’s activity, and connecting to others), we have in mind a sociology of interfaces that goes beyond the vernacular understanding of the term or even the conception articulated in the HCI literature. In the field of HCI, interface usually refers to the graphical user interface – the carefully designed features, tools, and buttons that either express content or provide a set of instructions for action. This understanding of the interface is task-oriented, focused on feedback loops and aimed at maximizing efficiency. In this mechanistic vision of the interface, the participant is cast as a ‘user’ rather than a subject (: 142). In this context, a key concept is that of ‘affordance’, originally introduced by ecological psychologist James Gibson to describe the relations between individuals and the environment through what it ‘provides and furnishes’ (: 127). Gibson used the term to develop a theory of perception in which animals and humans do not perceive the environment as such, but rather through its affordances, the possibilities for action it may offer. In the field of HCI, the meaning of the term has often been restricted  to the ‘perceived affordances’ that designers build into their artifacts in order to configure and determine the action possibilities of the users. At best, the interface is seen as a space where a two-step mediation takes place – between, first, an apparatus that seeks to frame and to constrain the behavior of a pre-defined user and, second, a participant who interprets and plays with the action possibilities offered by the apparatus. Following: 12–15), the interface of HCI might better be called a ‘surface’ (as in interface), rather than a relation between things (as in interface).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>19193</offset><text>Instead of seeing interfaces as things or as a surface, the literature in media studies has understood them, for example, as ‘autonomous zones of activity’ (: vii) or ‘form[s] of relation’ (: 2). For Hookway, the qualities of an interface lie not in a specific device or feature but in the relation between distinct entities that, at the same time, circumscribe the interface (interface as in ‘between faces’) and are shaped by the interface (interface as in ‘facing between’), producing in the end a ‘supplementation or augmentation of agency’ (: 17). Defined as ‘the point of juncture between different bodies’, interfaces ‘describe, hide, and condition the asymmetry between the elements conjoined’ (: 150). Building on this conceptualization of the interface, we propose to analyze the interfaces of our three citizen science projects/platforms as relational spaces where not only the relations between humans and machines are (re)made, but also where the very nature of the human (collectives) and machines is produced. Such a research program partly reconnects with the original, fundamentally relational notion of affordance, but goes beyond in that it acknowledges that the digital environment of platforms is much more dynamic and malleable than the natural environment studied by Gibson  and that ‘users’ do not preexist their presence and interactions on the interface.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>20606</offset><text>From crowd to community: Four technologies</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>20649</offset><text>If interfaces are less things – well-designed arrangements of features such as buttons, images and hyperlinks – than a relational space, then their functions should be redefined as well. Instead of studying how interfaces are made to catch, hold, and capitalize on the attention of pre-existing (or imagined) individual users, we propose to examine how interfaces manufacture the social or, more precisely, how, depending on what types of relations are produced inside them, interfaces create, stabilize, reproduce and govern different collectives. We distinguish between four ‘technologies’ that produce the relations inside the interface: Rhetorical technologies, technologies of the self, social technologies, and ontological technologies. We use this distinction as a useful analytical tool; however, in reality, each technology embeds the others and they generally co-exist. By using the term ‘technology’, we do not mean to imply that these technologies are fundamentally technical, nor that they are inescapably top-down, designed by some to shape the behavior of others (although, of course, agency is usually not equally distributed among actors). Rather, we use the term ‘technology’ in order to show how online collectives are an artifact of the discursive, personal, social, and ontological relations between humans and machines inside the interface.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>22028</offset><text>Rhetorical technologies</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>22052</offset><text>Communities are never just ‘taxonomic’ (the community as made of members who have similarities in the mind of the classifier) or ‘relational’ (the community as made of interrelations between members in reality) , they are also ‘rhetorical’: They exist by being ‘invoked, represented, presupposed’ in ‘discursive projection[s]’ and ‘rhetorical construct[s]’. In our three online citizen science projects, rhetorical technologies help to define the basic entities inside the interface by ascribing fixed meanings to them.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>22596</offset><text>One first venue for this discursive work is the project description page, where the project presents itself to the outside world. Zooniverse, for example, purports to be a ‘platform’ for ‘people-powered research’, that is, an open space for ‘people [to] come together’ and ‘work together’. Once they have joined the platforms, those people are neither referred to as ‘users’ nor as ‘participants’; rather, they are systematically characterized as ‘volunteers’. There is much at stake in these labeling processes; in particular, framing a gathering of actors as coherent or harmonious is crucial to the creation of a durable collective. This can be realized by appealing to a common moral purpose that transcends the social heterogeneity of the crowd. In the case of Zooniverse, actors are ‘volunteers’, meaning that they are all driven by a disinterested desire to help (science). In the project EyeWire, it is not shared altruism, but exalted curiosity which is put forward to cement the community. A visual from the EyeWire website accomplishes the same rhetorical effect as the ‘volunteer’ label in Zooniverse. The cartoon represents a group of ostensibly diverse people, in terms of gender, age, ethnicity, and professional background, gathering around a young-looking woman (wearing glasses) who is using a computer on which the EyeWire logo is affixed. For all its diversity, the unity of participants is achieved through the ascription of a common cognitive property: The caption reads, ‘gamers * students * teachers * scientists WE ARE WONDERERS’.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>24192</offset><text>I love the EyeWire heroes!!

BOINC projects routinely deliver badges to individual users and teams for a number of different accomplishments (total credit, length of participation, number of message-board posts), and these badges are sometimes displayed publicly by users, for example through banners embedded in forum messages, as marks of distinction and of authority which show how seriously some of the users take their participation to the platform. While no such technology exists in Zooniverse, EyeWire, in contrast, is an even more stratified community than BOINC, with users divided between normal ‘users’, ‘scouts’, ‘scythes’ (and, recently, ‘mystics’). Out of approximately 200,000 registered users, only 200 are scythes. Scouts and Scythes not only have a higher status – ‘in glowing turquoise armor, Scythes are EyeWire’s most powerful players next to Admins’, according to the EyeWire blog – they also play distinct roles in the project and enjoy a whole different user experience. While regular users complete cubes, scouts have access to a ‘heat map’ through which they can flag problematic cubes, and scythes review and correct the cubes that have been flagged. In the end, this stratification acts both as a division of labor and a social hierarchy based on distinction and past achievements.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>29212</offset><text>Social technologies</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>29232</offset><text>I think without that discussion area there isn’t really a community.

This includes actions such as discussing with users on chats, forums, social media and via emails, posting new contents on the web and especially on social media, policing public spaces, launching new contests and competitions, introducing new features to users and so forth. However, a crucial part of their work involves another constituency – the scientists. As online citizen science moves from single project to multiple-project platforms, teams of scientists have to be managed, like the users. Community managers in online citizen science not only make sure that the scientists’ concerns are taken into account (for example about data accuracy), but they also guide them in turning their research questions and raw data into a meaningful and attractive citizen science project for a broad audience, drawing on research about their own online communities (see Conclusion). Community managers encourage scientists to interact with the users on a regular basis, feeding the users with information on the project and on the results of their research.

The reluctance also comes from the fact that community management conflicts with the idea of an unmediated access to scientists, which is part of the appeal of these citizen science projects.

EyeWire is also expected to become a platform for various citizen science games in the future. By using the term ‘platformization’ we point less to the hegemonic rhetoric of ‘platforms’ or the ‘material-technical’ perspective on programmability through APIs and more to the socio-technical formatting that becoming a platform entails. Before platformization, project organizers and lead scientists were often the same person and in a direct relation with participants. With platformization, the scientists become another kind of users of the platform, along with the participants, and both are now in relation with the platform and those who maintain it, rather than with one another. Platform organizers and the platform itself assumes a mediating role between users and scientists. Automating the platform, not just for relation with the participants, but also with the scientists, becomes a priority. Both BOINC and Zooniverse have created tools that enable research teams interested in using their platform to build, from scratch, their own projects.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>50308</offset><text>These days, projects don’t … Projects can startup without me, without help from me.

With the Zooniverse Project Builder, scientists create a project out of a series of ‘workflows’ (‘the sequence of tasks that you’re asking volunteers to perform’) that are in turn made of four generic ‘tasks’: ‘Question’ (answering a question about an image), ‘drawing’ (marking features in the image), ‘text’ (transcribing a text) and ‘survey’ (recognizing specific items in an image).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>51489</offset><text>It’s designed for specific interaction with data.

Once platformization generalizes and reduces the analyses performed by the volunteers of citizen science into a limited number of basic tasks, these tasks become generic – that is, not necessarily linked to a specific scientific goal, or even to science:</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>52991</offset><text>The very nature of BOINC being an open-source project and having all the source code available online means that anybody anywhere can set up a BOINC project that they want. … That was one of the design goals for BOINC, it was to be a generic platform that anybody could use to do volunteer computing.

Although they initially embed volunteering as well as scientific norms through different technologies – either rhetoric, of the self, social and ontological – platformization transforms citizen science projects into spaces whose central function is perhaps less the production of scientific knowledge than mediation between tasks, collectives and machines. Already almost twenty years ago, SETI@home founder David Anderson had highlighted such flexibility, imagining that citizen science platforms could become ‘decision markets’, in which users would vote for scientific projects not by casting a ballot but by choosing to contribute to a project, thereby revealing their preferences: ‘Because computer owners can contribute to whatever project they choose, the control over resource allocation for science will be shifted away from government funding agencies and toward the public’, he predicted.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>55226</offset><text>Conclusion: From citizen science to a science of the citizen</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>55287</offset><text>It is not uncommon for citizen science projects, online or not, to couch their activities in political terms. Under the aegis of democratization and participation, a twofold promise is offered. First, as science ceases to be a closed domain reserved for an expert elite, scientific work will accelerate, new research practices will emerge, and, perhaps, new questions will be asked that are more aligned with the public interest. Second, as scientific research becomes accessible to anyone, a new kind of citizen will emerge, one who brings their working knowledge of science into the realm of liberal-democratic politics and participation . Analysts and commentators of citizen science have been keen on taking up these political promises, sometimes in a celebratory tone, sometimes in a more critical way – asking, for example, if actual practices measure up to the promise. But what exactly do ‘politics’ or ‘political’ mean here? A first, rather direct, but also subtly normative answer has been to cast the politics of citizen science in terms of power and agency toward defining scientific agendas and methods, for example, by positing a scale of participation and analyzing how individual projects fare with it (with the implication that some ways of sharing power between citizen and scientists are intrinsically better than others). A second, more circuitous answer has been to uphold the STS adage that the true politics of (citizen) science lie neither in discourse nor in organization but in the epistemic practices, calling for thick descriptions of the actual practices of citizen science, especially in relation with the longue durée history of the role of amateurs, invisible technicians and the public in the development and professionalization of science.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>57072</offset><text>We believe that another way to investigate the politics of citizen science is to look at the social forms of citizen science, and to ask how they are fabricated, maintained and regulated. Citizen science projects and their advocates often speak of their ‘community’ as if it were naturally constituted, essentially through the mutual interests (science as leisure), shared virtues (science as a way of life) and common values (science as a civic ideal) of their members. Yet, through our three case studies of online citizen science we have seen that it takes a huge amount of work and many chains of human-technical mediators to fabricate and maintain this collective and its apparent naturalness. Of course, other studies on different kinds of citizen science, especially social movement-based and medicine-related citizen science, which are very likely to involve different community dynamics, would be needed to better understand the constitution and governing of collectives through citizen science. Still, as virtually none of these projects take place entirely offline today, we believe that the interfaces of online citizen science projects offer a good starting point to delve into what we have called the technologies that construct and govern the collective. Once interfaces are defined less as things and boundaries than as relational spaces in which constitutive processes take place, it becomes possible to study their structure, their topography and their generative outcomes – in other words, how a number of technologies, diversely arranged, configure individual and collective actors, behaviors and actions. Neither the interface nor their technologies are simply designed by project organizers, as HCI would see it, but are co-constructed by the organizers and the users. Different combinations of rhetorical technologies, technologies of the self, social technologies, and ontological technologies – one may need to complement this typology for other kinds of citizen science, for example by examining political technologies – produce different kinds of collectives, but the case studies of BOINC, Zooniverse and EyeWire ultimately point to two ideal-typical ways of fabricating the community – one based on the shared values and norms of science, the other on self-interest, and competition. These technologies demand an important mediation work, accomplished by human and technical actors that engage in ‘community management’; in particular, community managers see their work as interfacing between two constituencies, the users and the scientists. The intensity of this mediation work, the amount of artifice necessary to stabilize and regulate the collective threatens the definition of the situation – that of a naturally occurring community in direct contact with science and scientists.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>59905</offset><text>I learned a tremendous amount about kind of the requirements.

Platformization not only answers the problem of scalability, it also generates the drive to generalize, standardize and, insofar as possible, automatize the functioning of the community. In the process, platforms lose their structural relation to their object, science, and tend to become neutral spaces that mediate between constituencies for the accomplishment of generic tasks. Moreover, as individual projects integrate platforms, they not only generate scientific results linked to specific scientific questions (whether in astronomy, climatology, history, and so forth), but they also tend to actively produce meta-knowledge on their users. The amount of HCI and psychology research that has been carried out on the community dynamics of citizen science, often with the involvement of the projects’ organizers and community managers, is quite striking. Such work typically tries to understand what motivates the users to contribute , proposes new design and features in order to retain users and stabilize the community (; ), or evaluates the epistemic reliability of users. Imperceptibly, in addition to producing scientific knowledge with the help of citizens, these platforms increasingly produce scientific knowledge about those very citizens. When they reflect on their past experience, organizers typically emphasize the knowledge they have gained in social engineering:</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>62228</offset><text>It is against this move – from citizen science to a science of the citizen, from crowdsourcing experiments to an ‘experiment into crowdsourcing’ – that the politics of citizen science can be cast in a new light.

Although they are not perfect, we have found the terms ‘users’ and ‘participants’ to be the most neutral in this context. In the same fashion, we will speak of the activities carried out on the projects/platforms as ‘using’, ‘participating’, or, in a more technical way, ‘performing tasks’. Because we do not want to cast the users’ activities in terms of ‘digital labor’, we will intentionally avoid using the term ‘work’. That online citizen science can or cannot qualify as digital labor is open to discussion, but it should be noted that neither an objective definition of digital labor (where activity becomes ‘labor’ because monetary value is produced out of it) nor a subjective definition (where activity becomes ‘labor’ because the actors think of and define their activity as work) can be easily applied to our three case studies.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>64305</offset><text>We identify each interview as coming from one of these three projects with a code, such as #Z2; the letter indicates the project/platform (B for SETI@home/BOINC; Z for GalaxyZoo/Zooniverse; E for EyeWire) and the number distinguishes the different interviews we have conducted for each project/platform.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>64609</offset><text>References</text></passage><passage><infon key="fpage">67</infon><infon key="lpage">106</infon><infon key="name_0">surname:Agre;given-names:PE</infon><infon key="name_1">surname:Thomas;given-names:PJ</infon><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="source">The Social and Interactional Dimensions
