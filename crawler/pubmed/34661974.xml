This opens the way to understand the heterogeneity of complex multi‐signaling networks across cells and cell types, with important implications to understand and treat diseases such as cancer. These technologies are, however, limited to proteins for which antibodies are available and are fairly costly, making predictions of new markers and of existing markers under new conditions a valuable alternative. To assess our capacity to make such predictions and boost further methodological development, we organized the Single Cell Signaling in Breast Cancer DREAM challenge. We used a mass cytometry dataset, covering 36 markers in over 4,000 conditions totaling 80 million single cells across 67 breast cancer cell lines. Through four increasingly difficult subchallenges, the participants predicted missing markers, new conditions, and the time‐course response of single cells to stimuli in the presence and absence of kinase inhibitors. The challenge results show that despite the stochastic nature of signal transduction in single cells, the signaling events are tightly controlled and machine learning methods can accurately predict new experimental data.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>1380</offset><text>This study presents the results and conclusions of the ‘Single Cell Signaling in Breast Cancer DREAM challenge’, where teams were challenged to use state‐of‐the‐art methods for predicting single‐cell signaling from single‐cell and bulk proteomics, transcriptomics and genomics data.  </text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1679</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1692</offset><text>Cell signaling governs most activities of cells as it underlies the ability to correctly respond to stimuli from the cellular microenvironment. This dynamic process of signaling is tightly regulated by the interactions of proteins. Deregulation and major disturbances in this finely tuned machinery can lead to diseases such as cancer (Hynes &amp; MacDonald,), autoimmunity (Benveniste et al,), and diabetes (Boucher et al,).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2116</offset><text>The abundance of signaling proteins and the mutation status of underlying genes vary across cell lines; therefore, different cell lines have distinct signaling networks. But not only different cell lines have different signaling networks: Cells of the same type display dissimilar signaling patterns in response to stimuli depending on history, cell state, and microenvironment. This heterogeneity has important implications for the treatment of diseases. For example, intratumor heterogeneity in cancer is a key contributor to therapeutic failure and drug resistance: Often subpopulations do not respond to therapies, resulting in relapses. Thus, a better understanding of signaling and its heterogeneity might unlock better treatments (Yaffe,).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2863</offset><text>Single‐cell measurements, particularly mass cytometry (Bodenmiller et al,; Spitzer &amp; Nolan,), have opened a new way to monitor the signaling in individual cells. With this technique, we can measure the cellular response to multiple perturbations, paving the way for understanding the heterogeneity of the underlying cellular mechanisms.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3203</offset><text>However, the measured nodes are limited to a handful of proteins for fluorescence‐based live cell imaging and several dozens for highly multiplexed mass cytometry. If we could predict nodes that are not measured via computational approaches, we could overcome this technological limitation. In addition, the number of combinatorial treatments in studies is often limited by the budget or available material, since these experiments are complicated and expensive. Therefore, it would also be desirable whether models could predict the single‐cell response of a cell line to new treatments after training on response data of other cell lines. One could even conceive models that predict the response to perturbations from only basal, unperturbed data.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3957</offset><text>Answering these questions requires advanced computational methods. Predictive mathematical models are often used for bulk data analysis (Byrne et al,; Rukhlenko et al,), but they have not yet been applied extensively to single‐cell data (Loos et al,). Therefore, as a first step, we need to assess the available modeling frameworks for single‐cell predictions on a fair platform and explore their use, capabilities, and also limits.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4397</offset><text>To accelerate the development of methods, we organized the Single Cell Signaling in Breast Cancer (SCSBrC) DREAM challenge. The Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) Challenges provides a framework for participants across the globe to compare their methods for solving biomedical problems (Saez‐Rodriguez et al,). The participants are ranked according to predefined metrics, and the solutions are analyzed to find the best ways to approach the particular problems. Further, the predictions, the methods, and the code that reproduce the results are made publicly available after the challenge as a stepping stone for further improvements. DREAM challenges have enabled the benchmark and development of methods in systems biology (Meyer &amp; Saez‐Rodriguez,), including the inference of signaling networks (Prill et al,; Hill et al,).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5261</offset><text>We based the SCSBrC challenge on a single‐cell signaling mass cytometry dataset (Tognetti et al,). In this dataset, 67 cell lines were stimulated with EGF and serum (referred hereafter as EGF treatment) in combination with one of five kinase inhibitors (PKC, PI3K, mTOR, MEK, and EGFR), and in each condition, 31 phosphoproteins and 5 cellular markers were measured at 10 different time points over the course of one hour (Fig 1, Appendix Fig S1 and Appendix Fig S2A). In total, this dataset includes more than 80 million single cells and more than 4,000 experimental conditions. The data are complemented with population‐level protein abundance experiments, transcriptomic data (RNAseq), and genomic data (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism and Copy Number Aberration; Marcotte et al,). A portion of this data was kept for scoring (test data), and the rest was provided as training data to the participants to develop their methods. Further, we encouraged participants to incorporate external data and resources of prior knowledge, such as pathways and protein–protein interaction databases, in their models.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">MSB-17-e10402-g006.jpg</infon><infon key="id">msb202110402-fig-0001</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_title_caption</infon><offset>6378</offset><text>Overview of the Single Cell Signaling in Breast Cancer challenge</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">MSB-17-e10402-g006.jpg</infon><infon key="id">msb202110402-fig-0001</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>6443</offset><text>The challenge data consist of genomic, basal transcriptomic, and proteomic data, and perturbation single‐cell phosphorylation datasets from 67 breast cancer cell lines.

In each subchallenge, a suitable metric was chosen to score the predictions.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6878</offset><text>Specifically, in our challenge we aimed to answer the following questions of increasing complexity: “Can we predict the signaling response (i) of nodes that are not directly measured from other measurements on the same cells?”, (ii) “to new combinatorial treatments based on how other cell lines respond to that treatment?”, (iii) “to perturbations for which we have no data but know the target?”, and (iv) purely from basal omics data?”. We defined four corresponding subchallenges (Fig 1).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7385</offset><text>We evaluated 73 models from 27 teams across the four subchallenges and found that machine learning‐based methods worked well for these prediction tasks (Fig 2). Subchallenge 1 showed that the signaling dynamics in nodes that are measured in some cell lines can be accurately predicted in other cell lines. In some cell lines, the basal phosphorylation of the nodes is significantly different from others, which may lead to a shift between measurements and predictions; therefore, we recommend to include the basal phosphorylation in the predictive models. Subchallenge 2 showed that the effect of kinase inhibitors can be learnt from other cell lines and predicted with high accuracy. Predictions performed better than random even when only the target of the kinase inhibitor is given (Subchallenge 3). Further, we found major differences between model types in terms of performance at capturing intra‐cell line heterogeneity. Finally, we found in Subchallenge 4 that models can partially predict the dynamics of a cell line from the basal omics if one uses the general signaling response of other cell lines.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">MSB-17-e10402-g001.jpg</infon><infon key="id">msb202110402-fig-0002</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_title_caption</infon><offset>8500</offset><text>Summary of the ranking of teams and their methods and data usage across subchallenges</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">MSB-17-e10402-g001.jpg</infon><infon key="id">msb202110402-fig-0002</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>8586</offset><text>A, B, C, and D summarize subchallenge 1–4, respectively.

The teams were ranked in each subchallenge (SC1‐4) based on their predictions on the test dataset (Fig 2A–D, respectively). The challenges were followed by a post‐challenge period where participants submitted write‐ups and code, and participated in a survey about their methods.

To obtain such models, we asked participants to predict the phosphorylation of selected proteins in single cells from specific cell lines and conditions (pink box; Fig 1). To do this, the participants could use the other nodes of the signaling network for the same condition and cell lines as well as the same nodes from different cell lines (green box; Fig 1; Appendix Fig S1). Specifically, we asked the participants to predict five markers (p‐ERKThr202/Tyr‐204, p‐AKTSer473, p‐PLCg2Tyr759, p‐HER2Tyr1196, and p‐S6Ser235/Ser236) in six cell lines, measured in all the 49 different conditions, totaling 11.9 million cells. The participants submitted their predictions for each measured single cell, and we compared them to the actual measurements of the markers using the root mean square error (RMSE) (see Materials and Methods and Fig 1). This performance was also compared against a reference model we built before the challenge using a random forest predictor (see Materials and Methods).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>11160</offset><text>Quality of predictions</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>11183</offset><text>First, we ranked the teams and compared their performance with random predictions and with a random forest‐based reference (see Materials and Methods, Appendix Table S4). For robust ranking, we used bootstrap sampling of the test conditions to generate a distribution of scores for each team (see Materials and Methods; Fig 2A). This identified the winner (icx_bxai, RMSEicx_bxai = 0.849), which strongly outperformed other participants (Bayes factor &gt; 499). For the random prediction, we took the test data and shuffled the unique cell‐ids in each cell line and experimental condition. This way, when we scored this randomized dataset, each cell was predicted by a randomly chosen other cell in the same cell line and experimental condition. Almost all teams performed better than this random prediction (Fig 2A), with 32% average improvement (RMSEteams average = 0.979 ± 0.238, RMSErandom = 1.44 ± 2.6e‐4). Six teams achieved better predictions than a reference model that we built before the challenge started (RMSEreference = 0.903, see Materials and Methods).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>12273</offset><text>Models predicted the trend of the data well, but for a few cell lines the predictions under‐ or overestimated the test data. Model predictions correlated strongly with the test data (median correlation coefficient: 0.761) in each condition (Fig 3A top) and explained large amounts of variance (R 2 median = 0.40, R 2 max = 0.803) across all teams (Fig 3A bottom). The explained variance was negative in some conditions, which means that the predictions of node phosphorylation were worse than the sample mean in those conditions. These conditions were found to belong to specific cell lines that had strongly different initial activation (at time 0, before stimulating) of the predicted nodes than the majority of cell lines (details below), leading to a shift between predictions and measurements.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">MSB-17-e10402-g002.jpg</infon><infon key="id">msb202110402-fig-0003</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_title_caption</infon><offset>13080</offset><text>Summary of subchallenge 1</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">MSB-17-e10402-g002.jpg</infon><infon key="id">msb202110402-fig-0003</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>13106</offset><text>Distribution of the correlation coefficients and explained variances across conditions, cell lines, and markers (N

To quantify how much the knowledge of this initial phosphorylation influences the accuracy of the predictions, we corrected the predictions by the difference between the predicted and measured mean basal activities of the cell lines. All the predictions improved significantly (Appendix Fig S3D): in average teams’ error decreased by 10.4%, and even for the top team the error decreased by 7% (from RMSEicx_bxai = 0.849 to RMSEicx_bxai, corrected = 0.789).

We used the winner’s method to learn signaling relationships among the measured markers in a set of cells overexpressing some proteins and then predict missing markers on cells expressing other proteins (Appendix Table S7). We found that the challenge winner’s method greatly outperformed a random prediction (RMSEteam, Lun = 0.508 vs. RMSErandom, Lun = 1.298; Appendix Fig S10), which demonstrates the applicability of the method on other datasets.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>15580</offset><text>What makes a good model for node prediction?</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>15625</offset><text>To understand what makes a model better than others, we analyzed the participants’ write‐up of methods and their answers to a questionnaire. The best three teams approached the prediction task with different methods: an ensemble of linear and tree‐based methods, convolutional neural networks, and gradient boosting, respectively (read about the details of each method in Appendix). Further, while teams 1 and 3 built models for each missing marker separately, the neural network model of team 2 predicted all the 5 missing markers together. Common among the three approaches are that all of them included all the 32 measured markers as model features among others and each team addressed the problem of missing data.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>16349</offset><text>We compared the building blocks of the methods to see which elements contributed to better predictions (Fig 3B).

In particular, pre‐processing of the data (mean RMSE improvement: 0.13, P = 0.0731 from a t‐test), using an ensemble of models (estimated RMSE improvement: 0.094, P = 0.0935), and training models on similar cell lines (improvement: 0.0949, P = 0.0975) had the largest individual impact on the score.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>16918</offset><text>While some teams relied on a single method to build their models, the top‐ranked team (icx_bxai) built a model for each marker independently and included the 32 provided markers, treatment, and time, and the top principal components of the proteomic data as features.

They used subsets of these features to train an ensemble of models: ElasticNet, ExtraTrees, RandomForest, Light Gradient Boosting, and linear model.

In particular, p‐Her2 was the most accurately predicted marker (improvement of 0.142 of the global mean RMSE; Appendix Table S2) and the largest prediction error was found for p‐S6 (deterioration of 0.305). Cell line HCC2218 has the largest prediction errors (0.246 above global mean RMSE), while other cell lines had similarly small prediction error values. The prediction error differences between cell lines and markers suggest that the cell lines show diverse signaling patterns that influence the models’ accuracy (Appendix Fig S4).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>19147</offset><text>As signaling is a dynamic process, we aggregated the predictions of each team and the test data at each time point and compared the time‐courses. The dynamic response of phosphosites changed strongly across the different perturbations and also between cell lines (Appendix Fig S4), which was captured well by the predictions. For example, MDAMB436 cells showed strong p‐AKT activation upon all perturbations with EGF, except when a PI3K inhibitor (iPI3K) was applied. The majority of models captured both the initial dynamics and the level at which the phosphorylation saturated and predicted the low response of p‐AKT when iPI3K was added. The measured members of the mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (e.g., p‐MEK, p‐ERK, and downstream p‐p90RSK) show similar activation dynamics in response to EGF stimulations, which was accurately predicted by most participants (Fig 4B). For example, there is a strong decrease in p‐ERK when we compare its response between EGF and iMEK conditions (mean phosphorylation decreases: log2 fold change −7.66, adj. P‐value = 4.14e‐23; Fig 4A), which was also predicted well by most models (Fig 4B). However, in five cell lines (four training cell lines: HCC2185, HCC1599, DU4475, CAL148 and one test cell line HCC2218), the p‐ERK phosphorylation did not decrease after inhibiting MEK (Fig 4B), indicating a rare (observed for 5 out of 67 cell lines) MEK independent ERK signaling.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">MSB-17-e10402-g005.jpg</infon><infon key="id">msb202110402-fig-0004</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_title_caption</infon><offset>20607</offset><text>Effect of kinase inhibitors</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">MSB-17-e10402-g005.jpg</infon><infon key="id">msb202110402-fig-0004</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>20635</offset><text>The population‐level effect of inhibitors on the phosphosites averaged across all 67 cell lines.

Seven out of the 16 teams performed better than our reference model (RMSEreference = 44.67), with up to 48% improvement (median improvement: 39.3%). Of note, a predictor corresponding to the lack of effect of the kinase inhibitor, thus using the measurements to the stimulus alone, leads to a score of RMSEEGF = 29.156. This relatively good score could be due to the fact that each inhibitor showed strong effect only on a few nodes in the measured part of the signaling network.

Their variation can be considered as an estimate of the upper‐bound of performance as it corresponds to the experimental error. Therefore, we also scored the participants on this subset of conditions and compared their scores to the variation of the measured individual biological replicas. Since SC2 and SC3 used different numbers of cell lines (12 and 38, respectively), we computed the prediction error per total number of predicted statistics. This allowed us to summarize the two subchallenges together (Fig 5A); however, they remain not directly comparable as the test cell lines and conditions were different. With that in mind, in SC2 the mean score of replica A and B (0.0753) is just slightly better than the top‐performing team (0.0782), which also holds for SC3, where the average score of the two biological replica is 0.0712 and the best team achieved 0.0725.

Further, all three predicted the cells in the target conditions using the available conditions of the same cell line, rather than from the same conditions of other cell lines. In the next step, they sampled from a multidimensional Gaussian distribution that followed the inferred statistics in each condition which resulted in the single‐cell predictions.

Therefore, we analyzed, for SC2, how the different methods generated heterogeneity and how this matched the heterogeneity found in the data (Fig 5C). We could distinguish two fundamentally different prediction methods. Five teams (including the top three teams) used methods that involve the estimation of population‐level statistics of the cells (mean and covariance) and then used a Gaussian sampler that generated single cells that followed the estimated statistics. Due to the Gaussian sampler, these approaches inherently assume homogeneity. These types of methods showed good performance: teams using this approach achieved on average 38.7% better score (Wilcoxon test, P‐value: 0.069) than teams relying on other methods (Fig 5D). Another popular method (3 teams) was to resample and then optionally scale the available training data (e.g., the 4th best team). This method does not rely on a similar assumption of normality, and thus manages to keep the underlying heterogeneity of the cells.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>30769</offset><text>The measured cells show heterogeneity: The single‐cell measurements have the tendency of forming multiple clusters that are driven by the cell cycle states (see Materials and Methods), and where all the cell lines are represented in each main cluster (Fig 5C).

However, when we focused on cells in a single‐cell line and single treatment conditions (Appendix Fig S7), the heterogeneity due to cell cycle states was only visible in the resampling method because resampling inherits the heterogeneity of the sampled cell lines, while the Gaussian sampler‐based method predicted homogeneously distributed cells.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>31611</offset><text>In summary, the participants predicted the time response of all markers in response to kinase inhibitors, first (SC2) to inhibitors with known effects and then (SC3) to an inhibitor which was absent from the training data.

We formulated subchallenge 4 (SC4) to investigate how well the dynamic response of cell lines can be predicted from their unperturbed, basal state.

In Subchallenge 1, the majority of the teams predicted missing nodes in the signaling network building models based on all the other measured nodes in each single cell and a summary (e.g., principal components) of the RNAseq and proteomic data. These types of models were trained on the cell lines provided and then used to predict the test cell lines. This implicitly assumes that the relationship among the nodes can be transferred between cell lines. This, in turn, could reflect common molecular programs driven by the shared lineage of the cell lines. We would thus expect less transferability when considering different tissues or processes that are less linked to each other as the ones considered here. The predictions strongly correlated with the test data and explained large amounts of variance, suggesting that there are indeed signaling interactions transferable among cell lines.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>39090</offset><text>However, we found two major pitfalls in the predictions. First, the models captured much better the trends than the absolute value of nodes’ activities in cases where the basal marker intensity of the test cell lines was much higher than of the training cell lines. If the absolute values are important, this can be an important limitation, but not for downstream analysis where the data are rescaled, e.g. (Tognetti et al,). In addition, the functional effect of at least some main pathways is driven by fold changes, and thus, predicting these, even if not being able to do so accurately for the absolute values, is helpful (Adler &amp; Alon,). The second pitfall is related to rare signaling cases: In the majority of cell lines, MEK phosphorylated ERK and the inhibition of MEK resulted in the lower phosphorylation of ERK. However, in a few cell lines, ERK showed a similar level of phosphorylation to EGF and Serum with and without the MEK inhibitor CI‐1040. This phenomenon was not captured by the predictions either because the number of such cell lines was low in the training data or because there was no information on this alternative relationship in the data, for example, if this phenomenon depends on the expression of non‐measured nodes. It might also be that those cell lines showed this behavior because the high concentration of MEK inhibitor resulted in cell type‐specific off‐target effects. This example illustrates the potential limitations of inhibitors for network inference, as off‐target effects can confound the results.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>40648</offset><text>The activity of cellular markers within a single condition in a cell line could show twofold to threefold differences across single cells.

This phenomenon is already recognized and is used by network inference algorithms, e.g. (Krishnaswamy et al,). Furthermore, the models were trained on some cell lines and predicted the behavior in other cell lines, which show that the learnt regulations are transferable between cell lines.

Further, instead of predicting each individual single cell directly, the top‐performing models derived statistical descriptors of the markers in each condition, predicted the distribution of cells in the target condition, and then sampled that distribution to generate the single cell predictions. We found that the predictions of the top team were almost as accurate as biological replicas, although it should be noted that we only had two replicates.

However, similarly to previous we did not find evidence for the idea that a specific type of algorithm performed significantly better than other types of models for these prediction challenges. Across subchallenges, we found that the ensemble of predictions of multiple teams is better than an average team, which means that the risk for a bad prediction can be mitigated by combining multiple approaches.
