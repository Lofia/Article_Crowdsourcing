This includes plain facts witnessed while on the job, related or not to one’s job responsibilities. Many of these facts, which we call “occurrence data”, are known by employees but remain unknown to the company. We suppose that some of them are valuable and may improve the company’s situational awareness. In the spirit of mobile crowdsensing, we propose intra-company crowdsensing (ICC), a method of “extracting” occurrence data from employees. In ICC, an employee occasionally responds to sensing requests, each about one plain fact. We elaborate the concept of ICC, proposing a model of human-system interaction, a system architecture, and an organizational process. We position ICC with respect to related concepts from information technology, and we look at it from selected organizational and managerial viewpoints. Finally, we conducted a survey, in which we presented the concept of ICC to employees of different companies and asked for their evaluation. Respondents positive about ICC outnumbered skeptics by a wide margin. The survey also revealed some concerns, mostly related to ICC being perceived as another employee surveillance tool. However, useful and acceptable sensing requests are likely to be found in every organization.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1388</offset><text>1. Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1404</offset><text>Consider energy consumption in a typical office building. Energy gets wasted by lights lighting empty spaces, thermostats set to heat stairways to room temperature, or air conditioners cooling empty rooms. These facts are easy to spot, but office workers do not recognize the problem as theirs and do not pay attention to them. We argue that there are many areas where plain facts, related to how the company functions, go unnoticed or overlooked. They include security, customer behavior, and work safety, to name a few. And there is an opportunity here; knowing these facts may improve the company’s situational awareness and operation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2045</offset><text>A seemingly obvious solution is to instrument space with sensors. The approach is consistent with current trends, such as the Internet-of-Things (IoT), but it does have disadvantages. The sensors need to be deployed and maintained. Some sensor data processing tasks are quite hard for computers to perform (e.g., image understanding). Carbon footprint, used batteries, and electronic waste contribute to an environmental impact. On top of that, ubiquitous sensing infrastructure may create a panopticon-like environment, with employees under constant surveillance.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2610</offset><text>Our approach is not meant to replace, but to complement IoT. It relies on humans; the sources of the facts are the company’s own employees, who contribute by responding to sensing requests. Each sensing request is about a plain fact, which should be known to an employee by virtue of their performing regular activities at the company. A software system distributes the requests so that no employee gets overloaded. Notably, it is up to the recipient whether to respond or not. We call the above system intra-company crowdsensing. It is crowdsensing in that it relies on a potentially large population (i.e., all employees) to “sense.” It is intra-company, as it is limited to the employees and does not reach out to the general public.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3353</offset><text>This paper makes three contributions. First, we put forward the thought that some plain facts, tacitly known by employees, may, when acquired, form a potentially valuable resource. We name the resource “occurrence data” and list some of its characteristics. Second, we contribute the concept of intra-company crowdsensing (ICC), a method to extract occurrence data from employees. ICC is software-driven and can be considered a novel digital/human work configuration. We elaborate ICC, proposing a human-system interaction model, a system architecture, and an organizational process. We position ICC against the background of information technology and look at it from several managerial perspectives. Third, we offer a survey-based evaluation of ICC. We present the method to employees of different companies and ask for their opinions and suggestions. In our coverage of ICC, we gather our own proposed solutions, applicable existing research, and views of our respondents, all to provide value to those interested in pursuing this exploration further. In particular, we uncover ICC-related challenges that deserve most attention.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4490</offset><text>As the name implies, the foundational concept for ICC is crowdsensing, and, more specifically, mobile crowdsensing (in its participatory version, where a person performs an action to contribute a piece of data). Our work belongs to the line of research that considers mobile crowdsensing, which relies on humans, as complementary to or synergistic with IoT, which relies on embedded nodes and other computational resources. Here we mention some examples of this approach. A recent survey reviews promising studies that use participatory mobile crowdsensing as a means of interaction between the users of an office building and its BMS (building management system). In, the detection of events in urban areas was studied. The paper explores the benefits of a hybrid system that combines mobile crowdsensing (in its opportunistic version, where sensing is done by a mobile device without the direct involvement of its owner) with a network of fixed sensors deployed in an area of interest. In, combining different actors, i.e., humans, robots, and environmental sensors, into a single sensing system is termed “heterogeneous crowdsensing”; complementary sensing powers and kinds of intelligence exhibited by the different “participants” in heterogeneous crowdsensing is highlighted. In, visual data from a city, obtained via participatory crowdsensing, was fed into the city’s 3D digital twin, thus making the twin more aligned with reality. In, crowdsensing is seen as a new generation of wireless sensor networks. The paper reviews techniques to produce much needed location information for carried or worn mobile sensors, which work on top of heterogeneous communication technologies.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6186</offset><text>While ICC can essentially be considered a special case of participatory mobile crowdsensing, two clarifications are in order. First, we explore participatory sensing in the unique context of a company. Being “intra-company” gives rise to a number of assumptions, problems, and opportunities, which do not exist in the “public” case. In that sense, the paper seems to open a new niche in mobile crowdsensing. Second, while ICC does indeed rely primarily on mobile devices, it may use other devices as well; sensing requests may be delivered via any personal device operated by an employee (e.g., a laptop or desktop), or via shared stationary terminals dedicated to specific locations. In that sense, crowdsensing is extended beyond relying solely on mobile devices; data acquired from human sensors matter more than the kind of devices used. We offer more information on how our work relates to mobile crowdsensing (and similar concepts) in Section 6.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7146</offset><text>From now on, we use the words “user” and “employee” interchangeably: in terms of user interaction, the employee who handles a sensing request is the primary user of an ICC system. In addition, we use “company” and “organization” interchangeably (we could use “enterprise” as well). Importantly, ICC is envisioned as applicable in any organization, not necessarily a business-oriented or industrial one.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7569</offset><text>In Section 2, we introduce occurrence data. In Section 3, we define intra-company crowdsensing and provide examples of sensing requests. In Section 4, we cover human-system interaction and user experience issues. In Section 5, we propose a generic ICC system architecture. In Section 6, we discuss how ICC relates to existing approaches in information and communication technologies (ICT). In Section 7, we look at ICC as an organizational process, and, in Section 8, we continue with an organizational and managerial outlook. In Section 9, we present the survey and its results. Section 10 concludes the paper.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>8181</offset><text>2. Occurrence Data as Company’s Overlooked Resource</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>8235</offset><text>Every day each employee learns about what is going on in their company. This may include complex insight, such as understanding the company’s market position derived from sales figures. However, much of what an employee learns are plain facts they simply witness while performing regular job activities or just by “being there” (at the company’s premises, with a customer, etc.). Notably, the facts need not be related to the employee’s job responsibilities. We use the term “occurrence data” to denote company-relevant plain facts (“occurrences”) an employee learns by doing their job at the workplace.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>8857</offset><text>They are specific and unambiguous.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>8892</offset><text>They are heterogeneous and cover many areas, even for a single employee.

Intra-Company Crowdsensing: Definition and Examples</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10083</offset><text>We propose intra-company crowdsensing (ICC) as a continuous, software-driven process of acquiring occurrence data from a company’s employees. It consists in regularly delivering sensing requests and collecting responses. Each sensing request concerns a plain fact, occurring now or in the recent past; it is not about an opinion, interpretation, or judgment. It is phrased as a closed-ended question or asks for a number. Once a request is delivered, it is up to the recipient whether to respond or not.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10589</offset><text>ICC is best explained by examples of sensing requests, as in Table 1. The examples are grouped into ICC “application areas,” as diverse as energy and water conservation, customer intelligence, security and cybersecurity, occupational safety and health-promoting work habits, sociometry and the efficiency of work activities, and, finally, the availability of workplace facilities and supplies. If needed, a sensing request in Table 1 is accompanied by a brief annotation on its context of use or recipient (in italics). Some of the examples may be used at any company, while others are company specific. Similarly, some sensing requests may be directed to most (or all) employees, while others are tailored to a specific role. In general, sensing requests should be designed for a given company and then for different roles its employees play.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>11437</offset><text>Certainly, not all potential ICC application areas are represented in Table 1. Quite a few examples belong to the office and building domain; one can certainly find more from construction, manufacturing, logistics, and the like. A company-wide ICC system can include sensing requests from multiple areas and domains, and the number of requests belonging to any of them may vary from one to many. Furthermore, both the ICC application areas and their sensing requests may change over time.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>11926</offset><text>4. User Interaction Model and User Experience Issues</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>11979</offset><text>For ICC to be successful, employees need to accept it and cooperate. Accordingly, the overall user experience is crucial. This is why ICC, as defined above, works in the pull mode: it is the system that triggers an action by delivering a sensing request. The push mode, i.e., contributing on one’s own initiative, would place more burden on an employee. For the same reason, we restrict our attention to voluntary participation. Here we describe an ICC interaction model and touch upon some user experience issues.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>12496</offset><text>4.1. ICC Terminals and Request Delivery Modes</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>12542</offset><text>We consider two kinds of terminals used for the delivery of sensing requests to a user: (a) personal terminals and (b) point of interest (POI) terminals. In either case, the terminal displays a sensing request and allows the user to enter a response. Personal terminals are primarily mobile devices, but they may also include laptops or desktops “owned” by an employee. A user interface like that of a messenger application may be used with a personal terminal. A less typical example of a personal terminal, designed for extreme conditions, would be an ICC-tailored wristband.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>13124</offset><text>We envision a POI terminal to be a compact, dedicated, standalone device deployed in some area. The terminal features a minimalistic user interface: a tiny screen and some buttons. On top of that, the POI terminal can alert people nearby, via blinking or beeping. The alerting starts when a new sensing request becomes available and stops after some time to avoid excessive disruption. The POI terminal is primarily meant to be deployed near an object or location of interest. However, it may be used to deliver assorted sensing requests.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>13663</offset><text>In line with our classification of terminals, we distinguish two delivery modes. With personal delivery one delivers to a specific person. Thus, if needed, one can reach employees who play specific roles matching the sensing request. In addition, personal delivery mitigates the diffusion of responsibility. With POI delivery one usually wants to reach anybody near a point of interest. POI delivery ensures anonymity and the lack of pressure on employees.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>14120</offset><text>Personal delivery can be context-aware, e.g., to avoid interrupting an employee when they are focused. Consider a bus driver. A sensing request should not be delivered when the bus moves, but it probably could be delivered at a bus stop (a condition easy to detect). Another reason for context-awareness (actually, location awareness) is to emulate POI delivery with personal delivery; a sensing request may be delivered to a person when they happen to be at a location of interest.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>14603</offset><text>4.2. Receiving and Reacting to Sensing Request</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>14650</offset><text>Receiving and handling a sensing request is the key use case in ICC. The request is a brief question about a plain fact. As shown in Figure 1, the question may be closed-ended (i.e., provided with possible answers), or it may ask for a number. Two generic buttons, “don’t know” and “dismiss”, are always available.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>14975</offset><text>A user who received a sensing request may react in different ways. The simplest one is to disregard the request, i.e., to do nothing, abstaining from any interaction with the terminal. In that case, after some expiry time, the request is withdrawn. The user may also explicitly dismiss the request using the dedicated buttons. As participation is voluntary, the user should be aware that disregarding and dismissing a request are as good reactions as any other.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>15437</offset><text>The user may also decide to respond to the request, by picking one of the presented answers or entering a number. The response should come either off the top of the user’s head or result from a brief check of a nearby place. In the latter case, the user may need to move to the place in question, look around, and go back (e.g., for a personal delivery, when the user is at their desk), or just to look around (e.g., for a POI delivery, when the user is already at the right place).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>15922</offset><text>4.3. System Intrusiveness and Load Balancing</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>15967</offset><text>The effort of handling a sensing request should not exceed that of answering an SMS or replying to an instant message. However, every sensing request introduces some disruption, which may lower the efficiency of doing primary tasks or cause a negative user reaction. This is especially the case for personal delivery when the recipient “owns” the request. We assume that ICC includes a load balancing mechanism. It is a technique of allocating requests to users so that no single user gets overwhelmed by too many of them delivered in a short time. In the proposed architecture of the ICC system (see below), we introduce a component responsible for load balancing.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>16637</offset><text>4.4. Self-Incrimination and Loss of Privacy</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>16681</offset><text>So far, we have described the ICC user interaction model without paying attention to what a sensing request is about. Many requests are quite “neutral” (e.g., “How many customers are currently looking at self-help books?”). Sometimes, however, responding to a sensing request may reflect badly on the person who answers or their colleagues. An honest response may imply that somebody is negligent (“Can you see any dangerous tools left unattended?”) or has poor work habits (“Did your last meeting end with action items?”). And even if a response itself is not negative, it may lead to undesirable loss of privacy. For example, responding “yes” to “Was the company parking lot full when you arrived today?” may reveal that the employee comes to work later than most (while still within company-set limits). In short, there is the danger that ICC may be perceived as a “big brother”; people may reject it because they do not want to reveal things about themselves or act as informers.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>17693</offset><text>It is an open issue how to ensure that people are not discouraged by incriminating responses or the loss of privacy, inherent in some (not all) sensing requests. Sometimes, anonymization is an option. It is not always possible, but, notably, POI delivery guarantees anonymity by design. Another approach is for the software to raise the level of abstraction of response-derived information. This way, ICC may be used to spot systemic problems rather than specific instances of “wrongdoing.” In some cases, employees will understand that concerns related to incrimination and privacy should come second to bigger issues. There are areas where not following procedures may lead to disastrous consequences, as in work safety and accident avoidance. In those cases, ICC may facilitate a kind of internal whistleblowing. Yet another approach may have to do with an explicitly stated organizational culture that promotes openness, awareness, and continuous improvement rather than punishment. Finally, an employee may always decide not to respond.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>18739</offset><text>5. Generic ICC System Architecture</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>18774</offset><text>In this section, we outline a high-level ICC system architecture and some lower-level details on how the system could be implemented. These are not the only possible choices; one can make different ones within the general ICC concept presented above. We use both the architecture and the details to exemplify and clarify the concept, not to limit it.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>19125</offset><text>5.1. ICC as Part of Context-Aware System</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>19166</offset><text>The architecture, shown in Figure 2, includes various sources of data about the state of the environment, not just ICC. These may be physical (non-human) sensors, such as those found in IoT instrumentation or a building management system (BMS). We use the term “context” (as in “context-aware computing”) to refer collectively to all such data. The intention is to treat all context uniformly, no matter whether a data item comes from a physical sensor or a human. Accordingly, all context data end up in the context repository, a core element in any well-engineered context-aware system.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>19763</offset><text>Figure 2 also shows some applications that use the context. One of them may generate higher-level insight from low-level context data. Such an application, called a logical sensor, is a place for possibly sophisticated AI, big data, or reasoning algorithms. Another application may drive actuators (not shown) to change the state of the environment. Yet another performs real-time context reporting to a human via a dashboard or alerts. As we refer to a company setting, Figure 2 shows integration with the company’s ERP (enterprise resource planning) system. Such integration is certainly desirable, but the system shown in Figure 2 could deliver value without a connection to ERP.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>20448</offset><text>In summary, Figure 2 shows a complete context-aware system, of which ICC is a part. One could build a system like this around an existing context-awareness platform, e.g., FIWARE). Of course, ICC must then obey the data model used by the platform’s context repository. Thus, introducing ICC does not require building the system shown in Figure 2 from scratch. Instead, it is more about integrating an ICC sub-system with an infrastructure already in place.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>20907</offset><text>5.2. ICC Databases: Sensing Requests, Users, POI Terminals</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>20966</offset><text>The ICC sub-system itself is driven by a request database, user database, and POI terminal database. All the three databases include profiles (attributes) and histories (assorted timestamped events) for their respective entities. The request database stores sensing requests used by the system. The profile of a sensing request may include the following attributes: (a) the text of the request, along with possible responses (as displayed on an ICC terminal), (b) a target location (optional), (c) a list of target roles (optional), (d) a request delivery schedule (optional), (e) request delivery context triggers (optional), (f) an oversampling factor, and (g) a response metadata pattern.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>21658</offset><text>The target location, if applicable, indicates a place on the company’s premises where an object or area of interest is (e.g., consider a sensing request referring to the thermostat in the kitchen room). It maps a request to the logical organization of the company’s space. A request with a target location is called location-targeted.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>21997</offset><text>The list of target roles specifies to whom the request may be delivered. A target role may include a division and position within the division. Note that here, one does not identify people, just roles. Again, the target roles are included only if applicable (e.g., if the request is about the number of customers in some store area, it should probably be delivered to a salesperson and not to the store manager). A request with one or more target roles is called role-targeted. Notably, the request database is agnostic as to the workforce; determining employees that play any of the target roles requires access to the user database, as described below. Note that being role-targeted is independent of being location-targeted (all four combinations are possible).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>22762</offset><text>The delivery schedule, included for requests with time-triggered delivery, specifies at what times, or how often, the request should be delivered to users. The other possibility is context-triggered delivery, where the request is delivered when some conditions, called context triggers, become fulfilled (e.g., when the outside temperature drops below zero). In general, delivering a request may be both time-triggered and context-triggered. The oversampling factor has to do with delivering one request to multiple users at a time to ensure the reliability of acquired data; it is the number of users from which the system seeks a response to the request at any given time. Finally, the response metadata pattern is a template for metadata added to a response when it is injected into the context repository.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>23572</offset><text>The user database stores information about the company’s employees. An employee’s profile may include: (a) their role (e.g., the division and position), (b) the location they work at (e.g., a room number), (c) locations they have access to, (d) their working schedule, and (e) context prerequisites for delivery (optional). The last item specifies that a request can be delivered to the employee only if some employee-related context conditions are met (e.g., only if the employee is in the conference room). The POI terminal database stores information on POI terminals. A POI terminal’s profile may include its location, interaction capabilities (e.g., whether it can display an arbitrary request), etc.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>24284</offset><text>Note the difference between a context trigger and a context prerequisite. The former belongs to the profile of a request and specifies that the request should be delivered when some environment-related contextual condition is met. The latter belongs to the profile of a user and specifies that no requests should be delivered to that user unless a user-related contextual condition is met.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>24674</offset><text>5.3. ICC Components: Request Manager, User Manager, POI Terminal Manager</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>24747</offset><text>The three major components of the ICC sub-system are the request manager (ReqMngr), user manager (UserMngr), and POI terminal manager (POIMngr). Each of them uses its respective database. ReqMngr detects when each sensing request should be delivered to users, initiates deliveries, and, having received responses, stores them in the context repository. To find out when to deliver, ReqMngr inspects the delivery schedule and context triggers (checking if the context triggers’ conditions are met is done by consulting the context repository). It may also take the request history into account. When a request is to be delivered, ReqMngr decides on the delivery mode. A possible mapping of different kinds of sensing requests to the delivery modes is shown in Figure 3. Then the request is passed to UserMngr for personal delivery or to POIMngr for POI delivery.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>25611</offset><text>The user manager (UserMngr), having received a request from ReqMngr, picks the user(s) to whom the request should be delivered. It does so by inspecting the request’s target roles and location (if any) and consulting the user database. First, UserMngr finds all eligible users: (a) for a role-targeted request, a user’s role in the organization must match at least one of the target roles, (b) for a location-targeted request, a user must have access to the target location. If the request is neither role-targeted nor location-targeted, all employees are eligible.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>26181</offset><text>Next, UserMngr finds the most appropriate users among the eligible ones. For each, it checks their working schedule and history. It finds out if another request delivery would not overload the employee (load balancing). For a location-targeted request, UserMngr estimates how long it would take the user to get to the location. The user manager also consults the context repository to check if the user’s current context satisfies their contextual prerequisites. Based on these factors, UserMngr picks the recipients (ideally, as many as the request’s oversampling factor). Thus, UserMngr is responsible both for delivery to the right employees and the overall user experience. In the end, UserMngr displays the request on the recipients’ personal terminals and collects responses (or indications of dismissal or disregard). These are passed to ReqMngr.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27041</offset><text>The POI terminal manager (POIMngr), having received a request and its target location from ReqMngr, finds POI terminals with matching locations.

Also, note that a company-wide messaging application (e.g., Slack), if deployed, could be used to handle user interaction. Then the ICC sub-system would conveniently take advantage of the existing communication infrastructure.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>28008</offset><text>5.4. Notes on Selecting Delivery Modes</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28047</offset><text>First, note that the POI delivery, as open to any user, is unsuitable for role-targeted requests; for them, one must use personal delivery. Next, we assume that location-targeted requests that are not role-targeted are passed for POI delivery (Figure 3). This is a natural choice, as the main reason for having POI terminals is to cover a specific location. However, if a POI delivery does not produce a response (maybe nobody is nearby the selected POI terminal), ReqMngr may try personal delivery; then, a responding employee needs to move to the location to inspect it.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28620</offset><text>We also assume, somewhat arbitrarily, that requests that are neither location-targeted nor role-targeted are passed for personal delivery (Figure 3). If a personal delivery does not produce a response (maybe all recipients have dismissed the request), ReqMngr may try POI delivery. In that case, the fact that POI terminals have specific locations does not matter; they become a means to deliver a location-neutral request.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>29044</offset><text>Combining the above, it follows that an ICC sub-system can work without POI delivery, i.e., without POI terminals. If there are no role-targeted requests, it can work without personal delivery. In that case, all requests (location-targeted or not) would be delivered via POI terminals, with the advantages of anonymization and lack of pressure on employees.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>29402</offset><text>5.5.

Let us assume that one wants to build a reusable ICC sub-system, i.e., one that can be used in different companies, after being customized for each one. Then such a platform should be based on a meta-model that allows one to develop and enter a model of a specific company, as part of the customization. The model of a company would include its organizational structure (e.g., its divisions and their relationships), the structure of its workforce (e.g., the positions or roles that can be held by its employees), and the composition and topology of its facilities (e.g., what logical locations are available, and how far away they are from one another). Once the platform is equipped with the model of the company, it can be populated with individual employees and sensing requests. The modeling challenge belongs to knowledge engineering and may use ontologies. For example, one can start with The Organization Ontology, available as a W3C recommendation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>30781</offset><text>Algorithms are needed to drive the operation of the request manager, user manager, and other components. For example, the request manager needs an algorithm to decide on the most promising delivery modes and an algorithm to detect fake responses to sensing requests with an oversampling factor greater than one. The user manager needs a load balancing algorithm and an algorithm that finds the distances between employees and target locations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>31225</offset><text>Finally, the integration challenge concerns interoperability of the ICC platform with the context repository and other pre-existing components of a company’s IT infrastructure.

Mobile Crowdsensing, Citizen Sensing, People-as-Sensors</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>31893</offset><text>In mobile crowdsensing, many people contribute data via their mobile devices. A data item may come from a device’s sensor without human involvement (opportunistic sensing), or it may result from a user’s action (participatory sensing). Mobile crowdsensing has been applied in several domains, e.g., smart city. Typically, participants come from the public at large (e.g., they are city dwellers). “Citizen sensing”, “citizen science”, “citizen as sensors”, and “people as sensors” are all terms with considerable overlap with mobile crowdsensing. They imply the involvement of “citizens” rather than the employees of a company.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>32545</offset><text>In ICC, most sensing requests are likely to be delivered via mobile devices. This makes ICC almost a variety of participatory mobile crowdsensing. It is a variety clearly distinguished by several characteristics. First, in ICC, potential participants do not come from the public. They are “insiders” who share a wealth of intra-company knowledge, operating procedures, values, objectives, etc.; the questions that can be asked of such participants and the way to communicate with them should be different. Second, the crowd of employees is structured and heterogeneous in terms of positions (roles). Accordingly, some sensing requests, rather than being directed to everybody (as in the case of a “flat” public crowd), can be role targeted. Third, while a mobile crowdsensing campaign usually covers a single issue, ICC may span multiple application areas within a single company (as shown in Table 1). Finally, in ICC, one need not be restricted to mobile devices but may also apply laptops, desktops, or, most notably, dedicated stationary POI terminals. The last characteristic means that ICC is not entirely subsumed by mobile crowdsensing.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>33698</offset><text>Mobile crowdsensing has been recently advocated in the context of industry, and, more specifically, Industry 4.0. Most employee-related use cases covered in those papers fall under opportunistic sensing, i.e., using physical sensors embedded in employees’ mobile devices (not the case in ICC). “Subjective” data provided by humans, “subjective assessments,” “human knowledge,” and “integrated human wisdom” are also mentioned in, with at least a part of this input meant to come from employees (the other part coming from customers). These ideas are close to ICC but are put forward in general terms. Moreover, ICC is not limited to industrial, or even business-oriented, organizational settings.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>34413</offset><text>Participatory sensing by employees can be traced in the experiment presented in. There, if physical sensors detect lights switched on in an empty room, a so-called “actuation request” is delivered to a nearby employee. The employee is asked to check if the light is indeed on and, if so, to switch it off. Asking the employee to check the light may be interpreted as a “sensing request” embedded in the actuation request. However, the main means of sensing used in is via physical sensors.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>34911</offset><text>In summary, while there exists an extensive body of research devoted to a “crowd” contributing data, there seems to be little on this idea in the context of any company or organization, where employees do participatory sensing.

Evidently, ICC satisfies both conditions quite well. First, in principle, data from ICC could also be obtained from a cyber-physical (computing) system, using sensors and algorithms. Second, the delivery of sensing requests is managed by the ICC (computer) system, which thus directs the human participation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>35798</offset><text>Human computation is often applied to tasks that are easy for humans, while hard or time-consuming for computer algorithms (e.g., image labeling).

We envision ICC, not as competing with IoT-based sensing, but as complementary to it. Both serve the same purpose, with different means (physical vs. human sensors). This is reflected in Figure 2, where data from both IoT and ICC end up in the context repository, stored in the same format. The two technologies can coexist within a single company. Further, we see IoT and ICC, to some extent, as interchangeable. ICC can be used instead of IoT when physical sensors have not yet been deployed, when they are expensive to deploy, or when sensing relies on understanding a situation (i.e., when humans are better than computers). As more physical sensors are deployed, ICC can be scaled down accordingly.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>37077</offset><text>One could argue that data acquired from people are fundamentally less reliable than those coming from physical sensors. However, this is more a matter of degree. In pervasive computing, assessing the quality of inherently imperfect context information has been an important issue for a long time. Data coming from non-human sensors have been described as possibly incomplete, imprecise, ambiguous, inconsistent, and outdated. Accordingly, various quality metrics, to be associated with every piece of context information, have been proposed. One may adopt a similar approach for data originating from ICC. Generally, we advocate treating ICC-originated data in much the same way as data coming from physical IoT sensors to the extent possible.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>37821</offset><text>ICC has a human dimension, and it qualifies as a cyber-physical-social system (CPSS) or a cyber-physical-human-system (CPHS). “Humans in CPSSs can be viewed as not only the service consumers but also the service providers”, a feature that ICC certainly exhibits.

Experience Sampling in Pervasive Computing</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>38727</offset><text>The experience sampling method (ESM) originates in psychology, but it is also used in pervasive computing to evaluate solutions with users. ICC and ESM are similar in that participants are prompted to enter data while “in the field”. The prompted user responds to a sensing request (in ICC) or fills out a short questionnaire (in ESM). In both methods, the user should be able to respond with ease. As the name implies, ESM is more about experiences, while ICC is about plain facts.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>39214</offset><text>Some arguments in favor of ESM (e.g., its ecological validity) seem to apply, after minor changes, to ICC. In addition, some concerns (e.g., about the burden on the participant, a possible drop in motivation, or the quality of contributed data) are similar. The common mode of operation gives rise to similar design issues. Examples include (a) how not to overload a user with interruptions, (b) how long to wait before deciding that a user has disregarded a prompt, or (c) whether to prompt in a context-aware way. One approach to motivate ESM participants is to establish a “research alliance, in which the participants understand the importance of their contribution to the study”. The recommendation can be applied in a company when talking to employees about ICC. Generally, insight from ESM can help design an ICC system, especially when it comes to user experience. The strong standing of ESM and its structural similarity to ICC hint at prospects for ICC adoption.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>40191</offset><text>6.5. Persuasive Technologies</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>40220</offset><text>Persuasive technology is about interactive computing systems designed to change people’s attitudes and behaviors. Consider ICC sensing requests such as “Have you taken a break from the sedentary position within the last hour?” or “How many months ago did you change the password to your work PC?”. These are used to collect useful occurrence data on health-related working habits and on following security procedures. But apart from being a means to collect data, such requests also have a persuasive component. Employees who receive them are implicitly reminded that it is desirable (or required) to take a break from the sedentary position or change one’s password. The reminding happens even if a request is disregarded or dismissed. Reminders are among the top motivational strategies applied in persuasive technology. Apart from being an implicit reminder, a sensing request implements a self-report strategy, where a user provides feedback to the system. In summary, a subset of ICC consisting of persuasive sensing requests (like those above) may be treated as a workplace persuasive technology aiming to implement a company’s procedures and policies. Such requests may lead to self-incrimination, so one should prioritize making the responses anonymous.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>41496</offset><text>7. ICC as Organizational Process</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>41529</offset><text>In this section and the next one, we look at ICC from the organizational point of view. Here we outline a possible company-wide process of implementing and running ICC. We assume that a platform with the functionality of the ICC sub-system (Figure 2) is available, probably as a third-party product. It could include the request manager, user manager, and databases. For simplicity, we consider personal delivery only.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>41948</offset><text>The process, shown in Figure 4, consists of consecutive phases, each with concurrently running, interdependent “threads.” The first phase, IT preparation, comprises customization and integration of the ICC platform. The customization starts with “telling” the platform about a company’s organization (divisions), the structure of its workforce (positions), and the structure of its space (assorted locations); it ends with populating the user database (Figure 2) with employees. The integration ensures interoperability with the company’s context repository or another data store. A data model translation plug-in to the ICC platform may be needed.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>42609</offset><text>The second phase is jumpstarting. Here we have a promotion and information thread: advertising the new activity to the employees, providing a rationale, explaining how it works, describing incentives, presenting risks and possible downsides, and answering questions. The rationale may inform how data obtained with ICC will improve the company’s operation; this follows the recommendation to “identify and communicate the business value of data,” a step in creating a data-driven culture. The downsides may include a negative impact on the employees’ privacy or an incriminatory flavor of some sensing requests. This, in turn, complies with the suggestion to “manage the ethical implications of data and analytics”. Such a thread is an opportunity for the management to demonstrate its commitment to ICC—an element much needed in ICT technology adoption.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>43478</offset><text>The other jumpstarting thread generates an initial set of sensing requests. This can be done by asking the employees themselves, via an internal crowdsourcing campaign initiated with an open call for sensing request proposals. Thus, everybody, not just the management, can contribute to setting up ICC. Such involvement of the workforce may reveal things that the employees see as problematic or unknown. It may also contribute to ICC being accepted, once it is operational. The proposals undergo some curation before they are stored in the request database (Figure 2).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>44048</offset><text>The third phase, operation, comprises four threads (Figure 4). The sensing thread, essential to ICC, consists in delivering sensing requests to the employees, collecting responses, and injecting them into the context repository. The sensing thread is realized by the ICC sub-system (Figure 2). The updating thread injects new sensing requests to the request database and removes old ones from there, on the fly. A sensing request may be removed when it is no longer needed or when it is not well received by the employees (as detected by the monitoring and feedback thread described below). A new sensing request may be proposed by any employee at any time; in fact, the internal crowdsourcing of sensing requests, started in the jumpstarting phase, may continue in the operation phase. Adding a new sensing request, and getting first responses to it, may happen very quickly. The data processing thread is where assorted applications (data analytics algorithms) derive higher-level insight from data in the context repository. Moreover, some raw data may be presented directly to responsible personnel. While not specific to ICC (data from different sources are processed together), the processing thread is where ICC adds value.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>45279</offset><text>The monitoring and feedback thread serves two distinct (though related) functions. First, it assesses the level of employee cooperation with the ICC system (e.g., whether the employees respond, whether there are signs of fake responses, etc.). The thread regularly calculates indicators that capture the “health” of the ICC system in this respect. This should not be done for an individual employee but for the workforce at large. Regularly assessing and inspecting the indicators amounts to runtime monitoring of the user acceptance of ICC.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>45825</offset><text>A simple acceptance indicator would be the overall response rate: the ratio of the number of all sensing request deliveries to the number of deliveries responded to. The response rate could also be maintained for each sensing request, to detect those requests that are frowned upon by employees. Another per-request indicator could measure inconsistencies among responses obtained when the oversampling factor is greater than one. A high level of inconsistency would suggest fake or incorrect responses.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>46329</offset><text>Disturbing values of the acceptance indicators should not lead to any actions against employees. Overall indicators require a big picture outlook. A low overall acceptance may indicate that the promotion and information thread was less than perfect; it may also point to a broader problem rooted in a dysfunctional organizational culture. A disturbing value of a per-request indicator is easier to deal with; the sensing request in question could be modified or removed. Beyond that, the mere fact that a sensing request “failed” may lead to some insight.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>46889</offset><text>The other function of the monitoring and feedback thread is to gauge benefits from ICC and inform both the management and employees on achieved positive outcomes. The regular feedback may include collected data, the company’s performance indicators, or actions taken. For example, one could highlight the amount of saved energy. Pinpointing the benefits may be difficult, but it should be done to keep employees motivated. The operation phase, and thus the entire ICC process, has no pre-determined end. It continues indefinitely, with the set of sensing requests updated on the fly to fit current needs.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>47496</offset><text>Notably, in our ICC process, employees do not simply participate in the sensing thread by responding to sensing requests.

At the same time, ICC is susceptible to general criticism towards datafication, namely that it leads to surveillance and loss of privacy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>49059</offset><text>8.2. “Instant” Input Collecting</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>49095</offset><text>Here we consider company-run systems that prompt people (employees or not) to enter simple pieces of information. Such systems (a) work in the pull mode, i.e., take initiative, (b) prompt on a regular basis, and (c) ask for little time and attention (they are “instant”).

Makers envision them to be used, not only by “generic” customers, but also by patients, students, visitors, passengers, and even employees. Our POI terminal is much like a customer feedback device, except they acquire data of different kinds. A device maker proposes asking employees about “happiness rating, wellbeing monitoring, engagement levels, change management, employee concerns, and culture alignment“. ICC collects plain facts, not opinions. On top of that, ICC includes personal delivery and role-targeted requests, both not possible with a customer feedback device.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>50927</offset><text>8.3. Internal Crowdsourcing</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>50955</offset><text>Internal crowdsourcing is, in simple terms, outsourcing to an organization’s own employees. It has been more formally defined as “an IT-enabled group activity based on an open call for participation in an enterprise”. ICC does not fit the definition in that it is not driven by an open call, but by multiple, assorted sensing requests. Furthermore, the “crowd” in internal crowdsourcing is flat, while in ICC it is structured (which gives rise to role-targeted requests). Therefore, ICC is not a group activity; responding to a given sensing request may be limited to just one employee. ICC fits the definition in that it is IT-enabled and limited to the employees. To offer a more detailed comparison, we review the components of a conceptual framework for internal crowdsourcing proposed in. The framework applies to ICC at the component level; differences are seen inside individual components.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>51863</offset><text>The two components of the framework where the differences are most fundamental are: problems to be addressed and expected outcomes. For internal crowdsourcing, the problems are in the areas of collective intelligence, design, and decision making; the outcomes are, respectively, knowledge integration, innovation, and choices. These challenges are typically of substantial intellectual weight and may include developing new product ideas or business strategies. For ICC, the problems and outcomes are more down-to-earth: the problem is the lack of some data about an existing activity, place, or object, and the outcome is occurrence data about that entity. In addition, while an internal crowdsourcing open call usually targets a single challenge, ICC is multi-topic; sensing requests may belong to different areas (Table 1).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>52690</offset><text>As to the governance component, the framework lists issues, such as corporate culture, incentives, quality assurance, and employee community management. Both internal crowdsourcing and ICC are different from the usual hierarchy-based work, and they need changes in the management model. Thus, governance issues are relevant to ICC, and some governance solutions may work well for both techniques.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>53087</offset><text>Another component of the conceptual framework covers roles that people play in internal crowdsourcing. Requestors initiate and manage a campaign, while solvers contribute their knowledge and ideas. These roles have their counterparts in ICC, but the respective tasks are different. Internal crowdsourcing requires a solver to expend significant effort to come up with new ideas. According to, “given their other work responsibilities, many employees do not have time to participate in crowdsourcing activities”. In ICC, a “solver’s” involvement is limited to a short reaction to a sensing request, which, by definition, should be easy to respond to (although, without proper load balancing, interruptions may occur too often).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>53824</offset><text>The next component is the use of IT. Internal crowdsourcing needs a platform that facilitates collaborating and exchanging ideas, e.g., idea management software. Unlike that, ICC involves a high level of automation and integration with existing IT infrastructure. In ICC, possibly sophisticated algorithms manage requests and users. Integration with a pre-existing data model is needed to merge data from ICC with data from other sources. In terms of the layers identified in, a technology for internal crowdsourcing belongs to the group and community layer, while that for ICC to the intelligent augmentation layer. The ICC sub-system fits the description of intelligent augmentation in that it is “able to perform managerial roles” and “produce work activities for humans”.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>54608</offset><text>The last component of the conceptual framework is the process. For internal crowdsourcing, it is a complete project cycle, with a beginning and an end, and with sequentially ordered phases.

Furthermore, in ICC, outcomes (occurrence data) are available from the very beginning of the operation phase.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>55015</offset><text>8.4.

A basic prerequisite for employee cooperation is a non-adversarial relationship between a company and its workforce.

It focuses on transparency, which is “the degree to which information flows freely within an organization, among managers and employees”. The way to transparency is through “an organizational climate in which no one fears the consequences of speaking up”. For some sensing requests, ICC relies on the lack of fear of “speaking up”; thus, a culture of candor should ease the acceptance of ICC.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>56101</offset><text>Notably, there seems to be an impact in the opposite direction as well; ICC, if introduced successfully, may affect a company’s culture.

ICC, yet another channel of information flow within a company, contributes to transparency by prompting small but concrete actions (i.e., responding to sensing requests).

The latter starts with an open call, directed to all, independently of their positions. And, ideally, the employees of a company contribute as equals. As such, internal crowdsourcing may trigger a shift towards a more democratic culture. ICC is egalitarian as well. While with role-targeted sensing requests, different people are asked about different things, the key use case of handling a sensing request is the same for all. Therefore, one may argue by analogy, ICC should also lead to democratization. By participating without hierarchy-based differentiation, employees may increasingly see themselves as active agents in their company.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>57571</offset><text>Responding to a sensing request makes an employee focus, even if very briefly, on the topic of the request. Occasionally having specific workplace activities, places, or objects at the center of attention, an employee may become inclined to see, so far overlooked, things without a prompt. In fact, ICC could be a tool to achieve just that: make employees more attentive to some “critical cues” and thus more aware of what is happening around them (e.g., noticing that lights are unnecessarily on). Company-wide perception, the first level of situational awareness, should then improve. For an employee, noticing things may trigger a sense of responsibility and engagement (e.g., turning a light off).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>58277</offset><text>Finally, ICC may contribute to a data-driven culture by involving employees in data acquisition and demonstrating benefits obtained from the data, e.g., reducing energy consumption.

Motivation to Participate</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>58648</offset><text>We describe ICC as an extra tool, orthogonal and complementary to existing work done by employees. As such, participation in ICC is not a part of job descriptions. Responding to sensing requests does not lead to gains in one’s individual job performance; hence, performance expectancy cannot be counted on as a factor leading to participation. As ICC is, by definition, voluntary, the same conclusion applies to social influence. On the positive side, effort expectancy should work for ICC, which is designed to require minimal effort. Overall, ensuring widespread employee participation appears non-trivial.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>59259</offset><text>Incidentally, the same problem is researched for internal crowdsourcing, without clear conclusions. As contributions in ICC are not nearly as prominent as those in internal crowdsourcing (e.g., new product ideas), company-wide “fame” is not a viable incentive in ICC. Further, recognizing employees active in ICC would likely put pressure on less active ones, which would violate the principle of voluntary participation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>59685</offset><text>Some people may be motivated by outcomes they value at the personal level. Energy savings enabled by ICC could motivate environmentally conscious people. Organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) may also play a role. According to the original definition, OCB refers to an employee’s behavior that “is discretionary, not directly or explicitly recognized by the formal reward system, and that in the aggregate promotes the effective functioning of the organization”. Responding to an ICC sensing request satisfies these conditions perfectly. The extent, to which ICC may rely on organizational citizenship behavior certainly depends on how prevalent the latter is in the company (which leads us back to the issue of culture).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>60417</offset><text>Incentivization has been researched in the context of mobile crowdsensing and the ESM method, among others. For example, adding personalized feedback and gamification to ESM is examined in and, respectively, and in a survey of incentives for mobile crowdsensing is presented. Some results from this research may apply to ICC. However, compared to “public” crowdsensing, ICC presents a more subtle challenge. In the public case, the relationship between a participant and the organization is based on recruitment for crowdsensing tasks alone. The relationship is much weaker than in the case of ICC, where it is based on employment. Unlike in the public case, the pool of ICC participants, i.e., the workforce of a company, is not easy to change. Organizational culture, mutual dependence between an employee and their employer (where ICC plays a marginal role at best), and the possibility of having more privacy-sensitive sensing requests (than, e.g., a request to report traffic intensity in a city) all make a difference. The unique context of a company, with all its complexities, may call for a fresh look at incentive mechanisms.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>61557</offset><text>9.

It took about fifteen minutes to complete the revised questionnaire. We used non-probabilistic, convenience sampling.

Next, we provide four principles of interacting with INFOBot (Table 2, item 2) and ask a respondent to imagine being contacted by it (Table 2, item 3).

There was a wide variety in the functions of company divisions (with around 30 categories represented) and job titles (although most referred to knowledge work). Approximately 33% of the respondents managed people; for these, the average and maximum numbers of direct and indirect reports were 10 and 70, respectively. As to stationary vs. mobile work, the largest group were desk workers (71%), followed by those who do both (22%) and those who mostly move at work (7%).

Finally, the “add comment” button adds a feature of opportunistic interaction: whenever a sensing request is delivered, an employee has a chance to write anything on whatever topic, whether related to the request or not.

We stressed that, until now, a lot of occurrence data, while potentially valuable, have been overlooked. We proposed and elaborated the technique of intra-company crowdsensing (ICC), a way to extract occurrence data from employees. In doing so, we approached ICC from different points of view: user-centered (the interaction model), technical (the system architecture), and organizational (the ICC process). We positioned ICC against the background of information and communication technologies (ICT) as well as selected managerial issues. Finally, we conducted a survey to learn how employees react to the concept of ICC. The results indicate that ICC is worth pursuing, but one should design an ICC system with care for it to be accepted.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>79128</offset><text>This paper provides groundwork and calls for further research. One key research challenge is to explore the nature, scope, and value of occurrence data. A technique to extract occurrence data is justified only if the data itself is valuable. Attention should be paid to non-office work environments, as the present paper tends to focus on the office domain. Another key challenge has to do with ICC being accepted by the workforce. The conditions of benevolent employee participation, when an employee responds and provides correct data, seem more subtle than in the case of “public” crowdsensing. There are implementation challenges related to modeling an organization, developing algorithms to handle sensing requests and manage users, as well as integrating ICC with pre-existing IT infrastructure. Our next step is to implement an ICC system, deploy it in a company, and validate ICC via an experiment in-the-wild. We also hope that this paper will trigger interest in ICC in the research community.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>80136</offset><text>ICC is not a datafication panacea.
