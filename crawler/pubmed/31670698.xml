A chi-square test revealed a positive relationship between respondents’ general privacy concern and their average concern about Internet research (P&lt;.005). We found associations between respondents’ Twitter literacy and their concerns about the ability for researchers to monitor their Twitter activity for clinical trial recruitment (P=.001) and whether they consider Twitter monitoring for clinical trial recruitment as eavesdropping (P&lt;.001) and an invasion of privacy (P=.003). As Twitter literacy increased, so did people’s concerns about researchers monitoring Twitter activity. Our data support the previously suggested use of the nonexceptionalist methodology for assessing social media in research, insofar as social media-based recruitment does not need to be considered exceptional and, for most, it is considered preferable to traditional in-person interventions at physical clinics. The expressed attitudes were highly contextual, depending on factors such as the type of disease or health topic (eg, HIV/AIDS vs obesity vs smoking), the entity or person monitoring users on Twitter, and the monitored information.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon><infon key="type">abstract_title_1</infon><offset>2667</offset><text>Conclusions</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>2679</offset><text>The data and findings from this study contribute to the critical dialogue with the public about the use of social media in clinical research. The findings suggest that most users do not think that monitoring Twitter for clinical trial recruitment constitutes inappropriate surveillance or a violation of privacy. However, researchers should remain mindful that some participants might find social media monitoring problematic when connected with certain conditions or health topics. Further research should isolate factors that influence the level of concern among social media users across platforms and populations and inform the development of more clear and consistent guidelines.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>3364</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>3377</offset><text>Background</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3388</offset><text>The success of clinical trials depends on the enrollment of study participants, also referred to as research participant recruitment. Recruitment involves attracting and selecting suitable study participants. It can be conducted through different communication channels (eg, newspapers, radio, television, posters, brochures, email, and social media). Without their involvement, medical and scientific progress that benefits patients would be impossible. A recent systematic review found that 76.1% (131/172) of randomized clinical trials discontinued due to poor recruitment. There is an urgent need for innovative solutions to address the issue of underenrollment in clinical trials. We wanted to assess the feasibility of using Twitter user data for enhancing clinical trial recruitment. There is growing interest in using social media data for research, which is also referred to as infoveillance or digital epidemiology. This type of social media monitoring uses insights from social media users’ activity and conversations to learn more about their attitudes and behaviors. Active recruitment occurs when research team members approach and interact with specific individuals to enroll them in research on the basis of pre-existing knowledge of characteristics that would make them suitable candidates for particular clinical trials. We hypothesized that users’ data and their conversations derived from the social network Twitter could serve as a useful tool to identify and recruit potential participants for specific clinical trials.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4934</offset><text>In the context of the Internet and social media, user privacy is commonly considered a process of boundary management where individuals regulate disclosures in their social relationships through adjustments to the transmission and sharing of personal information online. In her theory of communication privacy management, Petronio argues that individuals are regularly engaged in decisions about disclosing or concealing private information within any given context. As the Internet and social media platforms become increasingly embedded into everyday life, they introduce new flows of information that challenge privacy norms and make managing boundaries more difficult. Such dynamism is central to the notion of networked privacy, which Marwick and Boyd define as the “ongoing negotiation of contexts in a networked ecosystem in which contexts regularly blur and collapse”. Additionally, Nissenbaum’s theory of contextual integrity takes context as its starting point. The contextual integrity framework rests on the understanding that social interactions occur in particular contexts and that norms govern people’s expectations of how personal information should flow within a given context. Rejecting the traditional dichotomy of public versus private information, as well as the notion that a user’s preferences and decisions of privacy are independent of context, contextual integrity provides a framework for evaluating the flow of personal information between different agents; it also provides a framework for explaining why certain patterns of information flow might be acceptable in one context but viewed as problematic in another. These approaches to privacy on social media platforms prompted us to consider user expectations of appropriate information flows in the context of monitoring Twitter activity for the purpose of clinical trial recruitment.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6811</offset><text>Nearly one-quarter of American adults (22%) use Twitter. Twitter users can send short messages, called tweets, that are limited to 280 characters; they can also search for any public message and further engage with tweets (ie, they can like, reply to, and retweet [ie, share] them). Previous research suggested that Twitter provides a “rich and promising avenue for exploring how patients conceptualize and communicate about their specific health issues” and provides an avenue for raising awareness of clinical trials and boosting enrollment.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7359</offset><text>To test the feasibility of Twitter monitoring for recruiting clinical trial participants, we decided to develop a use case for a multisite cancer study on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with patients in remission. These patients present a uniquely challenging population to recruit for clinical studies. AML, when active, typically leads to severe symptoms and hospitalization. Hospitalized patients are more accessible to screen, identify, and recruit for clinical trials. Once AML patients have completed their consolidation chemotherapy, they only visit their doctor every 3-4 months. The clinical trial we chose for this case study was designed to recruit patients in the first 3 months after they complete their consolidation chemotherapy, precisely the time when these patients have only sporadic contact with the health care system. Traditional techniques employed during routine patient contact would not be possible for this population. Furthermore, since postremission maintenance therapy is not a routine part of clinical practice for AML, we were unlikely to receive referrals from community physicians for this clinical trial. Therefore, we sought to examine the feasibility of a social media monitoring-enabled solution.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>8592</offset><text>However, in their review of the study protocol, the Central Institutional Review Board (CIRB) of the National Institute of Cancer raised concerns about the potential breach of privacy using monitoring techniques on Twitter. The CIRB committee noted the following:</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>8856</offset><text>Those who openly share their information via social media platforms may still have an expectation of privacy and/or be unaware of the platform’s privacy policies. To contact people after utilizing the approach of “active listening” may be perceived by some potential participants as eavesdropping on their conversations about their health... This may produce distrust and potential participants may interpret this as an invasion of their privacy even though social media is understood by many to be a public sphere. Privacy risks specific to [a Twitter user’s] diagnosis may be increased by taking part in the study. The study team, by echoing the information about an individual’s diagnosis, may amplify this information, so it’s more likely to come to the attention of the public or an employer.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9666</offset><text>We used this feedback as guidance and motivation for designing the following research study to ascertain people's attitudes and level of concern about the use of social media monitoring on Twitter for targeted clinical trial recruitment.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>9904</offset><text>Study Objective and Hypotheses</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9935</offset><text>Scientists have pointed out a lack of the inclusion of public views to inform future practices in social media research and social media-enabled recruitment. Furthermore, a recent survey about the general use of tweets in research showed a lack of awareness among Twitter users that their public tweets could be used by researchers. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the attitudes and level of concern among the public about using Twitter for the monitoring of social media users and their conversations in order to identify and recruit clinical trial participants. We focused on a variety of health topics, including cancer, obesity, human papilloma virus (HPV), HIV/AIDS, and smoking. The reason we chose to include a range of health topics, including nontransmissible and transmissible diseases, is that it reflects the spectrum of clinical trials that are being conducted in the United States and globally. We anticipated that the level of concern might vary by disease type and should be taken into consideration when choosing the recruitment method.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>11011</offset><text>This study tested four primary and three additional hypotheses related to potential privacy concerns with the use of Twitter monitoring for clinical trial recruitment (see Textbox 1). Motivated by the CIRB’s comments, we developed three hypotheses to test the CIRB’s concerns regarding the potential for Twitter users to perceive social media monitoring as invasive and a violation of privacy: see Hypotheses 1-3 in Textbox 1. Drawing from Gelinas et al, we also sought to test the validity of the nonexceptionalist methodology, which suggests that recruiting clinical trial participants online should be normalized and should not be considered exceptional compared to traditional, offline recruitment strategies: see Hypothesis 4 in Textbox 1. They argue that “social media recruitment should be evaluated in substantially the same way as more traditional analogue or ‘off-line’ recruitment.” Building from these four primary hypotheses, we sought to determine whether additional factors might impact participants’ level of concern with social media monitoring for clinical trial participant recruitment. We isolated different factors within the vignettes for further analysis (ie, the type of information being monitored, the kind of disease or health topic of the clinical trial, and the nature of the entity engaged in the monitoring): see Hypotheses 5-7 in Textbox 1.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>12398</offset><text>Our results are based on the views of the public and they support the formulation of evidence-based guidelines to assist researchers and Institutional Review Board (IRB) professionals using social media in clinical research recruitment.

Most questions were required; however, in some cases they were optional or allowed multiple answers. We incorporated two attention-check questions to assess respondents’ attentiveness to the wording of questions and eliminated from the final dataset those respondents who failed them. We tested the survey in order to evaluate the reading level and complexity of the questions, acceptability of the instrument to participants, the respondent burden, and time needed to complete the instrument. Among the testers were two community members (promotora, ie, lay Hispanic or Latino community members who receive specialized training to provide basic health education in the community without being professional health care workers) from Los Angeles, three experts from the Community Engagement Core Group team at the Southern California Clinical and Translational Science Institute at the University of Southern California, and four graduate students from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

Twitter ads provide a number of targeting options for reaching a specific target audience. Targeting features used for ads in this study included (1) age targeting to adults aged 18 or older, (2) location targeting to the United States, (3) language targeting to users who understand English, and (4) keyword and hashtag targeting for words and hashtagged words that Twitter users have tweeted or searched for on Twitter related to four main categories. The four categories to which targeted keywords or hashtags were related were (1) social media and social media surveillance, (2) research participant recruitment and clinical trial enrolment, (3) ethics and Internet privacy, and (4) clinical research and clinical trials. Each ad included a brief description (eg, “Your opinion on social media surveillance on Twitter and for a chance at a gift card. Survey and raffle entry.”), an image related to survey taking, a request for volunteers needed, a request for providing feedback, and a link to the questionnaire. Twitter ads were posted by the principal investigator's Twitter handle (ie, @dmsci). Our recruitment target was 500 participants. The daily maximum ad budget was set at US $49 with a total budget of US $980 for the entirety of the project. Respondents on Twitter had the opportunity to enter a raffle to win one of 10 US $100 gift cards upon completion of the survey. Duplicate and fraudulent responses were identified and removed as described by Teitcher et al. More specifically, we used four methods to check for duplicate and fraudulent responses: (1) we checked for inconsistent and irregular answers, (2) we assessed the survey submission time stamps and batch submissions, (3) we examined email addresses that used random English words followed by three to six random letters (eg, upgradeyhujer@gmail.com), and (4) we contacted suspected respondents via email and asked them to verify the answers to three questions included in the survey to compare their responses (ie, their first name, age, and highest education level).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_3</infon><offset>19676</offset><text>TurkPrime Recruitment</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>19698</offset><text>The second sample used in this study was recruited through TurkPrime, a panel service that allows researchers to target specific demographic groups. Prime Panels provides researchers with access to members of a number of market research panels through a Web interface similar to Amazon’s crowdsourcing platform Mechanical Turk, which has been found to be an effective method to recruit study participants online across a wide spectrum of disciplines. However, TurkPrime offers a proportional matching sampling approach. The study was visible to eligible participants on their dashboards. They also received an email inviting them to participate in the study. We applied a census-matched template provided by TurkPrime that ensured that the sample proportionally matched the US adult population, aged 18 years or older, in terms of gender, age, race, ethnicity, and US region. More specifically, target benchmarks for key demographics included the following: gender—male (49.4%) and female (50.6%); age in years—18-29 (22.4%), 30-39 (16.8%), 40-49 (16.4%), 50-59 (17.8%), 60-69 (14.0%), and 70-99 (12.6%); Hispanic—not Hispanic (84.0%) and Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish (16.0%); and ethnicity—white (78.8%), black or African American (13%), American Indian or Alaska Native (1.2%), Asian (4.8%), and some other race (2.2%). These characteristics were targeted because they were underrepresented in the Twitter study convenience sample. Upon completion of the survey, study participants received compensation in the amount that they agreed to with the market research platform through which they entered the survey. Upon successful completion of the survey’s attention-check questions, participants were also given bonuses. Bonuses serve as incentives for participation and have shown a substantial effect on data quality and the creativity of workers. Target recruitment was 500 participants, for a total budget of US $3500.

We analyzed the data on two levels: (1) at the respondent level to test control variables (individual factors: level 2) and (2) at the vignette level to test independent variables (contextual factors: level 1). Survey responses were first analyzed through descriptive statistical methods to assess the distribution of participants across our dependent and independent variables, such as the degree of privacy concern and demographic factors. Next, data regarding the different levels of concern for each vignette were further analyzed using pivot tables to identify any relationships between the levels of general privacy concern and the participants’ attitudes regarding the vignettes. We defined a high level of concern as responses that indicated Very or somewhat concerned and a low level of concern as responses that indicated Not too or not at all concerned. Finally, we also analyzed the responses using descriptive and inferential statistical techniques (ie, crosstabs and chi-square tests) to determine, generally, where respondents had strong concerns regarding the use of Twitter monitoring in clinical trial recruitment and where respondents had a weaker understanding of Twitter’s functions and usage policies. In particular, we looked to see if the concern regarding the use of Twitter monitoring in clinical trial recruitment was correlated with greater or less knowledge of Twitter, the type of monitoring used, or the method of outreach to the potential recruit. We report the results in aggregated form with all individually identifying information removed.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>26328</offset><text>Institutional Review Board Review and Approval</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>26375</offset><text>The study was reviewed and approved by the IRB at the University of Southern California (HS-17-00348).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>26478</offset><text>Results</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>26486</offset><text>Description of Participants</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_3</infon><offset>26514</offset><text>Demographics</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>26527</offset><text>Overall, the sample of 603 participants showed the following distribution (see Multimedia Appendix 2): 324 were male (53.7%) and 261 were female (43.3%); the majority were non-Hispanic white (421/603, 64.5%), 63 (9.7%) were Hispanic, and 66 (10.1%) were African American or black; and roughly a quarter (152/603, 25.2%) were 18-29 years of age and 107 (17.7%) were older than 60 years.

While the CIRB’s concerns have some basis, with 4 in 10 respondents feeling Twitter monitoring is eavesdropping and an invasion of privacy, the concern was not widespread, even among those expressing higher levels of general online privacy concern. This suggests that while clinical researchers should be mindful that some Twitter users will be wary of being monitored for the purpose of clinical trial recruitment, these concerns should not prevent the recruitment strategy from being pursued. Tactics such as Privacy by Design, for example, through privacy notices and disclaimers, can be applied to achieve privacy in social media-based research recruitment. Our data also show a statistically significant relationship between respondents’ general privacy concern and their average concern about Internet-based research activities. Those who were generally more concerned about Internet privacy were also more concerned about different aspects of Twitter monitoring for trial recruitment, such as who was performing the monitoring and what information was being monitored. We found the opposite effect among those respondents who were generally less concerned about Internet privacy and who were active, frequent Twitter users. Our data suggest that being an active Twitter user might impact the level of privacy concern expressed regarding Twitter-based Internet research activities. This suggests that users who are more active online and aware of general privacy concerns are also more likely to be concerned about Twitter monitoring for clinical trial recruitment, due to a higher overall awareness of privacy and surveillance online. </text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>54894</offset><text>Furthermore, the CIRB committee noted that “those who openly share their information via social media platforms may still be unaware of the platforms’ privacy policies.” We found that there is a significant association between respondents’ Twitter literacy and their concerns about the ability for researchers to monitor their Twitter activity, generally, for the purpose of clinical trial recruitment. We further found a significant association between respondents’ Twitter literacy and their concerns about researchers monitoring particular information types on Twitter (eg, hashtags, public tweets, and profile description) for the purpose of clinical trial recruitment. We cannot state, however, that these concerns necessarily increase as Twitter literacy increases. Related to the CIRB’s concerns, we also found a significant association between respondents’ Twitter literacy and whether they consider Twitter monitoring for clinical trial recruitment as eavesdropping and an invasion of privacy; however, there was no significant association between Twitter literacy and whether respondents felt Twitter monitoring jeopardizes confidentiality. Overall, there is a significant association between respondents’ Twitter literacy and their overall concern with researchers monitoring Twitter activity, suggesting that the more that users understood about Twitter as a platform, the greater they were concerned about researchers monitoring their Twitter activity. This presents a challenge seen in many areas of online literacy, as confirmed in studies of Internet users, in general, as well as with social network users, in particular. Thus, on the one hand, the more that people understand social media platforms, the more they are aware of possible privacy concerns. On the other hand, those who do not have high Twitter literacy might not be expressing concerns because they simply do not understand the potential threat.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>56838</offset><text>Testing the Nonexceptionalist Methodology</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>56880</offset><text>Gelinas et al suggested employing a nonexceptionalist methodology for assessing social media recruitment in research and “normalizing social media recruitment techniques while remaining sensitive to their potentially novel aspects”. They argue that “social media recruitment should be evaluated in substantially the same way as more traditional analogue or ‘off-line’ recruitment.” This includes (1) the identification of “a more familiar off-line variant or equivalent of the social media technique being proposed,” (2) identification of substantive ethical considerations with a focus on the respect for the privacy and other interests of social media users and investigator transparency, and (3) clarification and evaluation of any aspects in which the online version differs from the more traditional offline equivalent. We used a series of vignettes to assess respondents’ attitudes toward a more traditional, offline scenario and asked them about their attitudes toward patients discretely being approached in person as they leave a medical facility. We found that, regardless of previous Twitter usage and across all disease types, most people were either indifferent, did not know, or were less comfortable with an in-person approach. This suggests that even while many respondents expressed concern over social media monitoring as eavesdropping or a potential violation of privacy, as noted above, they did not find it any more concerning than the more traditional means of clinical trial subject recruitment. In fact, our data show that less than one-third of the respondents preferred in-person recruitment over the Twitter-monitoring approach described in the vignettes. Even among those with a high level of general online privacy concern, only 38% preferred in-person recruitment. However, in-person recruitment is the current standard practice. Our findings support Gelinas et al, insofar as social media-based recruitment in itself does not need to be considered exceptional from the participant’s perspective, while researchers should also remain mindful that some participants will find it problematic.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>59021</offset><text>Additional Factors That Influence the Level of Concern </text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>59077</offset><text>Following Marwick and Boyd and Nissenbaum, our findings support the notion that users frame privacy concerns in online platforms contextually and that when contexts collapse or blur, privacy concerns might emerge. Nearly half the respondents indicated general concern about researchers actively monitoring users’ Twitter activity to identify and contact potential participants for clinical trials. This suggests that, for many, a context collapse occurred that triggered some level of privacy concern; for example, information posted publicly for one reason, such as to share with one’s Twitter followers, was taken from that social context and used for a different purpose (ie, clinical trial recruitment).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>59789</offset><text>Our findings further support the point previously made by Bender et al that “within health information, there are gradients of sensitivity,” and certain health topics and disease types, such as cancer, may be considered less-sensitive personal health information. We found that the monitoring of Twitter user data that was related to HIV/AIDS raised the highest level of concern compared to monitoring related to cancer, HPV, obesity, or smoking. This may be partly due to the fact that HIV/AIDS is still associated with stigma.

The range of ages, education levels, and socioeconomic statuses of these populations could be more limited than those found in the general public. A total of 22% of US adults use Twitter, nearly equally among white, black, and Hispanic adults across all ages but with the highest usage among those 18-29 years of age. TurkPrime workers (ie, turkers) are diverse across several demographic dimensions, such as age, gender, and income, but are not precisely representative of the United States as a whole. Therefore, our findings may also not be generalizable to the monitoring of other social media platforms with different norms and privacy expectations, such as Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, or Snapchat. Although we expect to see similarities in public attitudes, future research will need to shed more light on how the results presented here might play out across different populations and different platforms.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>63620</offset><text>Additionally, this was an exploratory study prompted by the feedback from a national research organization (ie, CIRB) and the sample size of this study was limited.

Public social networks such as Twitter offer the clinical research community a novel opportunity for identifying and engaging potential study participants based on user activity data. However, the availability of public social media data has led to new ethical challenges about respecting user privacy and the appropriateness of monitoring social media for clinical trial recruitment. The results of this study suggest that most users do not think monitoring Twitter for the purpose of clinical trial recruitment constitutes inappropriate surveillance or a violation of privacy. Our data further support the previously suggested use of the nonexceptionalist methodology for assessing social media in research, insofar as social media-based recruitment in itself does not need to be considered exceptional from the participant’s perspective and, for most, it is considered preferable to traditional in-person interventions at physical clinics. Notwithstanding these findings, researchers should also remain mindful that some participants might find social media monitoring problematic when connected with certain conditions. The expressed attitudes were highly contextual, depending on factors such as the type of disease or health topic and the entity or person who monitored users on Twitter. Further research should isolate factors that influence the level of concern among social media users across platforms and inform the development of more clear and consistent guidelines.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>65689</offset><text>Conflicts of Interest: None
