However, group dynamics may also lead individuals to relinquish moral responsibility by conforming to the majority’s preference for punishment. Across five experiments (N = 399), we find Victims and Jurors tasked with restoring justice become increasingly punitive (by as much as 40%) as groups express a desire to punish, with every additional punisher augmenting an individual’s punishment rates. This influence is so potent that knowing about a past group’s preference continues swaying decisions even when they cannot affect present outcomes. Using computational models of decision-making, we test long-standing theories of how groups influence choice. We find groups induce conformity by making individuals less cautious and more impulsive, and by amplifying the value of punishment. However, compared to Victims, Jurors are more sensitive to moral violation severity and less readily swayed by the group. Conformity to a group’s punitive preference also extends to weightier moral violations such as assault and theft. Our results demonstrate that groups can powerfully shift an individual’s punitive preference across a variety of contexts, while additionally revealing the cognitive mechanisms by which social influence alters moral values.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1516</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1529</offset><text>In the classic film Twelve Angry Men, a jury must decide whether to convict a defendant accused of murder, thereby condemning him to death. In a memorable scene, Juror #8 hesitantly looks around the table as the initial vote is being taken by a show of hands, then conforms to the majority by voting ‘guilty.’ Why did the juror look to his peers when considering his vote? As in the film, it could be that we turn to others for guidance about how to enact justice in real-world contexts. Decades of conformity experiments demonstrate that individuals’ behaviors, preferences, and beliefs can be swayed by their peers in domains as wide-ranging as visual perception, inferences about socially normative behaviors, intensity of pain experience, preferences for food and music, and the attractiveness of faces. Furthermore, recent evidence from both lab and field studies suggests that people behave more prosocially after observing others engaging in behaviors such as cooperation and generosity.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2530</offset><text>However, since moral values appear to be deeply-held, stable across time, and resistant to change, a parallel literature on moral cognition makes a different prediction: insofar as punishment is a method of restoring justice following a moral violation, punitive preferences should be less susceptible to group influence. For example, people form more extreme judgments of an action’s rightness or wrongness when primed to perceive the action as having a moral dimension, which results in a stronger entrenchment of moral attitudes. In field studies, moralized attitudes lead to decreased support for political compromise and contribute to the intractability of conflicts in which sacred values are at stake. Indeed, it appears that moral attitudes may be an immutable feature of one’s individual identity, and are therefore unwavering across social contexts.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3394</offset><text>Given these divergent predictions, an important goal is to test the susceptibility of moral attitudes—in this case, punishment preferences—to group influence, and to understand the social and cognitive factors that might lead an individual to conform to a group’s desire to punish. Understanding the malleability of punitive preferences is especially important given that punishment of norm violators is a pervasive part of human social life. Moreover, punishment decisions are often made within group contexts, and are decided both by those who have been directly affected by a crime (i.e., victims), and by those who are impartial third parties (i.e., jurors).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4063</offset><text>Victims, for example, are often given the ability to recommend (or even determine) punishment across a wide variety of social settings: the submission of impact statements as evidence in a courtroom, deployment of informal or quasi-judicial practices in institutional contexts such as universities based on the responses of many victims, tribal and religious councils, war tribunals where punishment recommendations are made collectively by victims, and even instances when people employ vigilante justice. These real-world decisions about justice are sometimes made within contexts where groups have the ability to sway a victim’s desire for punishing a perpetrator, as is commonly observed when crowd dynamics lead to escalated violence during riots.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4818</offset><text>A juror—who is tasked with making punishment decisions on behalf of victims—typically also makes a punishment recommendation within the context of a group, which introduces the possibility that an individual juror can be swayed by others’ preferences. One large-scale field study surveyed nearly 3,500 real jurors who had actually decided upon felony cases and found that over one-third of them would have reversed their jury’s decision if they had been given sole control over the trial’s outcome. Though observational studies such as these are limited in their ability to establish causal mechanisms, this finding provides preliminary evidence that a group’s preference can have a powerful influence on one’s willingness to punish. This is an especially important phenomenon to understand if we consider that wrongful punishment has catastrophic and irreversible consequences. As a vivid illustration of the potential consequences of conformity in punishment decisions, we return to the fictional example from Twelve Angry Men, in which all but one juror initially voted to convict. Were it not for this standalone juror who refused to be swayed by the majority, the defendant—proven innocent at the end of the film—would have been wrongfully sentenced to death.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6101</offset><text>To investigate the psychological factors and cognitive mechanisms influencing one’s willingness to endorse punishment as a means of restoring justice, we leverage an interdisciplinary approach, drawing from social psychology, behavioral economics, and computational modeling. We first tested whether individuals’ punitive preferences are malleable when they are a victim of a moral violation (Experiments 1–2). Based on classic conformity research showing that individuals are sensitive to the proportion of people within a group who endorse an option in a non-moral context, we examined whether victims’ punishment rates scale with the proportion of punitive preferences expressed within a group (Experiment 1). We further investigated the strength of social influence by examining whether victims’ punishment behaviors continue to be affected by a past group’s punitive preferences, even when that past group’s preference is objectively irrelevant to the current decision (Experiment 2). Given existing work illustrating that people punish norm violators both as a second-party victim or third-party juror, we then tested whether an individual’s susceptibility to group influence hinges on whether they are a wronged victim or an unaffected juror (Experiments 3–4). In addition to examining behavior, we employed a computational model of decision-making (the Drift Diffusion Model) to reveal how a group’s preferences influence the cognitive processes underlying punishment decisions when tasked with restoring justice. Finally, we assessed whether conformity to a group’s punitive preferences generalizes to a variety of other real-world moral transgressions (Experiment 5).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>7801</offset><text>Results</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>7809</offset><text>Experiment 1: Susceptibility to a group’s punishment preferences as Last Decider</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">41598_2019_48050_Fig1_HTML.jpg</infon><infon key="id">Fig1</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>7892</offset><text>Task and trial structure for Experiment 1 (Last Decider) and 2 (First Decider).

Subjects completed a variant of the Justice Game, an economic task specifically designed to measure punitive and non-punitive responses to fairness violations. In this task, Player A is endowed with $10 on each trial and can choose how much to split with the subject, who always takes the role of Player B (Fig. 1a). Player A’s splits ranged from mildly unfair (a 6/4 split in which Player A keeps $6 and offers $4) to highly unfair (9/1 split) in $1 increments. After receiving an unfair offer, Player B then decided how to restore justice by choosing to: (i) Accept Player A’s split as-is; (ii) Compensate themselves in a cost-free manner by increasing their own payout to match Player A’s payout, without punishing Player A; or (iii) Reverse Player A’s split, a highly retributive option that maximizes Player B’s own payout and minimizes Player A’s payout (Fig. 1a).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9918</offset><text>Subjects first completed a Solo Phase of this task, allowing us to measure subjects’ punishment preferences in the absence of any social influence.

Indeed, subjects Reversed at greater rates as offers became increasingly unequal, indicating that they perceived small offers as unfair and punished the perpetrator accordingly. Subjects played with new Player As on each trial.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10611</offset><text>Subjects then completed a Group Phase of the task, in which they were told that they were sharing the role of Player B alongside four other subjects, and that their responses would collectively determine the payouts of all the players (Fig. 1b). Specifically, subjects were informed that the payout redistribution would be determined by the majority choice of the five Player Bs, that Player A’s payout would be affected by Player Bs’ collective decision just as it had in the Solo Phase, and that each Player B would receive the full payout. As in the Solo Phase, each of the players sharing the role of Player B could choose to Accept, Compensate, or Reverse Player A’s split, and subjects observed the other Player Bs’ choices in sequence, as if they were made in real time (Fig. 1b). Subjects always responded last, following the format of the classic Asch conformity paradigm. Subjects played with new Player As and Bs on each trial. To test the possibility that endorsement rates of the punitive Reverse option would increase as the number of punishers within the group increased, we parametrically and deterministically varied the proportion of players who selected the punitive option from 0% to 100%.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">Tab1.xml</infon><infon key="id">Tab1</infon><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="type">table_caption</infon><offset>11831</offset><text>Experiment 1: Last Decider.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">Tab1.xml</infon><infon key="id">Tab1</infon><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="type">table</infon><infon key="xml">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;

We modeled the probability of punishing as an additive combination of the proportion of punishers in the group (centered around 50% punishers), the unfairness of Player A’s offer (centered around medium unfairness), and each subject’s baseline preference for punishment (i.e., the proportion of Solo Phase trials in which a subject chose to Reverse instead of Compensate, matched for offer unfairness and centered around 50% punishment). Results reveal that individuals significantly increase punishment as a greater proportion of the group expresses a punitive preference, even after accounting for offer unfairness and baseline punitive preferences (Table 1; Fig. 2). This effect was so strong that the group was ultimately able to shift individuals’ predicted punishment rates as much as 30 percentage points.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>13927</offset><text>Experiment 2: Influence of past groups’ punishment preferences as First Decider</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>14009</offset><text>The findings from Experiment 1 are the first that we are aware of illustrating that individuals’ moral attitudes about punishment vary with the intensity of a group’s preference. To examine the robustness of this conformity effect and the potency of social influence, we conducted a second experiment examining the possibility that individuals might even conform to previous groups endorsing punishment. Specifically, we tested two competing hypotheses: whether the effect of social influence is abolished as soon as a past group’s preferences are no longer relevant to the current decision context, or whether knowing that a past group sanctioned punishment would also affect how readily an individual chooses to punish in the present moment. Evidence for the second hypothesis would suggest that decisions to punish are highly malleable. To probe whether subjects’ punitive behaviors are susceptible to influence even from past groups’ preferences, subjects in Experiment 2 were first in their group to decide during the Group Phase (i.e. playing as the “First Decider”, in contrast to Experiment 1, in which subjects played as the “Last Decider”).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>15178</offset><text>The methodology of Experiment 2 was identical to that of Experiment 1, with one key difference: the sequence of Player Bs in the Group Phase was fixed so that subjects were always the first person in the group to make their decision (Fig. 1c). When deciding first, subjects did not have access to their present group’s punitive preferences. Therefore, on any given trial, the only two pieces of information that could affect a subject’s decision were the unfairness of Player A’s offer and the preferences of past groups. Given that behavioral economic experiments examining fairness norms have found that people are sensitive to the magnitude of fairness violations, including in the Justice Game, we defined the proportion of punishers in a way that would allow us to match fairness violations across trials. We employed a simple analysis approach such that on each trial, we recorded Player A’s fairness violation (from mildly unfair splits of $6/$4 to highly unfair splits of $9/$1), searched backwards until we found the most recent past trial in which the severity of the fairness violation matched that of the present trial, and then used the proportion of punishers observed on that past trial to predict decisions to punish on the current trial. Alternative models with different operationalization of trial history are discussed in the Supplementary Results; we report the best-fitting model here.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>16595</offset><text>This task design also allows us to address two potential concerns about the validity of our paradigm: first, that explicit pressure to conform in Experiment 1 encouraged subjects to behave in ways they believed would please the experimenter, and second, that the observed conformity effect is only observable under conditions where people believe that their individual decision has little influence on the outcome of the group’s final decision. Therefore, in addition to testing whether punishment decisions remain susceptible to past groups’ influence, the task design of Experiment 2 also allowed us to determine whether the conformity effect replicates in a decision context where explicit pressure to conform is reduced and where subjects explicitly know their choice can affect the final outcome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">Tab2.xml</infon><infon key="id">Tab2</infon><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="type">table_caption</infon><offset>17401</offset><text>Experiment 2: First Decider.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">Tab2.xml</infon><infon key="id">Tab2</infon><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="type">table</infon><infon key="xml">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;

Though the DDM is typically used in perceptual decision-making contexts, it is well-suited for examining the effects of social influence, and has recently gained some traction within the social domain, successfully explaining how social groups bias perceptual judgments and even how altruistic decisions unfold.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>19642</offset><text>In the context of our task, DDM uses choices and reaction time distributions to characterize how people integrate evidence about the value of punishment (such as the group’s punitive preference) relative to compensation. This allows us to decompose the decision-making process into psychologically-meaningful parameters. First, bias (z) quantifies the extent to which people lean towards one of the justice restoration options prior to observing any evidence. Second, decision threshold (a) indexes the amount of evidence subjects need in order to make a choice, thereby capturing how cautiously individuals make choices in the presence (and absence) of group influence. Third, drift rate (v) indexes the strength of evidence favoring either punishment or compensation obtained from observing the group’s preference, and therefore how much an individual weighs the value of punishment relative to the value of compensation. Importantly, the strength of evidence in our task is not dependent on the dynamics of the stimulus (such as movement coherence in random dot motion tasks), but instead reflects the psychological process through which a group’s punitive preferences are dynamically integrated into an individual’s valuation of punishment.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>20895</offset><text>Therefore, DDM enables us to rigorously test two longstanding hypotheses from social psychological theory about how group influence acts on the cognitive mechanisms governing decision-making. First, we can test whether the presence of a group majority lowers the stakes of an individual’s decision (as the subject is now merely one vote out of many), thereby reducing the total amount of evidence required to commit to a choice and leading the individual to relinquish moral responsibility. Second, we can test whether the proportion of people within a group endorsing a punitive option increases the strength of evidence that punishment is a valuable method for restoring justice.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">41598_2019_48050_Fig3_HTML.jpg</infon><infon key="id">Fig3</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>21579</offset><text>Schematics and behavioral results of Experiments 3 and 4 (Victim and Juror). (a) As in the Last Decider study, subjects in Experiments 3 and 4 observed their group’s punishment preferences prior to indicating their own punishment preference. In this example, the group is evenly split between punishers and compensators. (b) According to the Drift Diffusion Model (DDM), people make decisions by noisily accumulating evidence in favor of each of the options until a decision bound is reached. In this cartoon schematic, subjects are biased such that they initially prefer compensation over punishment, indicated by the starting point z; they require some threshold of evidence in order to commit to a choice, indicated by a; and they accumulate evidence in favor of compensation, indicated by v. Together, these parameters dictate the shapes of reaction time distributions for punishment and compensation. (c) In this example trial, the group unanimously prefers to punish the unfair offer. (d) We illustrate using a cartoon schematic how conformity to the group underlie shifts in the v and a parameters, thereby changing choice and reaction time distributions.

First, because the best-established DDMs only account for binary choices, subjects were only presented with the Compensate and Reverse options on each trial. Second, subjects sometimes made decisions in the absence of information about others’ preferences during the Group Phase of the task (hereafter referred as the Alone condition), which allows us to avoid ordering confounds from the Solo Phase that might contaminate DDM parameters (e.g. from unrelated motor or task learning). Third, offers from Player As were placed within discrete monetary bins and jittered to offset task habituation from repeatedly seeing only four distinct offer types (as in Experiments 1–2), which was especially important given the large number of trials needed to estimate DDM parameters. Therefore, offers from Player As were binned into three levels of unfairness, all drawn from a uniform distribution in increments of 10¢: Mildly Unfair offers between $3.70 and $4.90, Somewhat Unfair offers between $1.90 and $3.10, and Highly Unfair offers between $0.10 and $1.30. Finally, because DDM requires reaction time (RT) distributions to capture the decision process in its entirety, subjects were simultaneously presented with Player A’s offer and four randomly-sampled responses from other Player Bs (Fig. 3a,c; this is in contrast to Experiments 1–2, in which subjects observed Player A offers and Player B choices sequentially). Subjects were free to make a response at their own pace, but were encouraged to make decisions as quickly as possible.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">Tab3.xml</infon><infon key="id">Tab3</infon><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="type">table_caption</infon><offset>24726</offset><text>Experiment 3: Punishing as Victim.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">Tab3.xml</infon><infon key="id">Tab3</infon><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="type">table</infon><infon key="xml">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;

We then used the HDDM software package to perform hierarchical Bayesian estimation of DDM parameters. The drift rate (v), threshold (a), and bias (z) parameters were estimated at the group level using a hierarchical Bayesian procedure. This allows individuals’ contributions to the group parameters to be weighted according to their diagnostic value, maximizes power by capitalizing on statistical similarities between subjects, and addresses collinearity between variables by incorporating greater uncertainty in the posteriors of parameter estimates. To additionally account for within-subject variability, the proportion of punishers was regressed onto the DDM parameters of interest. Three regressions were performed, one for each bin of offer unfairness. Decisions to punish were mapped to the upper boundary, and decisions to compensate were mapped to the lower boundary (Fig. 3b). Separate parameters were fit for each bin of offer unfairness. Drift rate and threshold were allowed to vary by the proportion of punishers in the group, whereas a single bias parameter was estimated for each type of unfairness. This model specification reflects that people likely have preexisting biases about how much punishment is warranted depending on the degree of fairness violations, while making no claims that preexisting bias varies according to group dynamics.

This would be reflected by the bias (z) parameter being closer to the decision boundary for compensating (see Fig. 3b for a schematic). Values greater than 0.5 indicate an initial preference for punishment, and values less than 0.5 indicate an initial preference for compensation. Indeed, we found that Victims exhibit a preference for compensation over punishment, reflected by 95% of posterior z estimates falling under the point value 0.5 (average z for Mildly Unfair = 0.42, Somewhat Unfair = 0.43, Highly Unfair = 0.44, all posterior Ps &lt; 0.001).

That is, Victims may be reluctant to punish norm violators because they believe that retribution is perceived as being socially undesirable; observing others being punitive would then enable them to act upon their latent desire to punish.

In other words, the degree of unfairness does not influence Victims’ valuation of punishment, whereas Jurors incorporate this information into their decisions, placing higher value on punishment as unfairness increases. Additionally, the regression betas for the number of punishers are significantly greater for Victims than Jurors (all posterior Ps &lt; 0.001; Fig. 6b), meaning that each additional punisher in a group provides stronger evidence that punishment is valuable when one is an affected Victim than when one is an impartial Juror.

The overall pattern of results reveals that the proportion of group members endorsing severe punishment significantly modulates subjects’ judgments of how severely crimes should be punished (Fig. 7b), both when they are Victims (Table 5) and Jurors (Table 6). A formal comparison between Victims and Jurors further reveals that the overall conformity effect is significantly stronger for Jurors than for Victims (β = 2.06, SE = 0.69, z = 3.00, df = 224.00, p = 0.003), unlike our findings from Experiments 3–4. This divergence may be due to differences in moral decision-making when choices are hypothetical, or may alternatively be due to the fact that the vignettes used in Experiment 5 involve moral transgressions that are more severe than the fairness violations in Experiments 1–4.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>42968</offset><text>Discussion</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>42979</offset><text>Groups often make better decisions than individuals by aggregating the knowledge, perspectives, and opinions of many people. This insight has led legal systems in many countries to use juries as fact-finders and arbiters of punishment. Though juries are often able to use the ‘wisdom of the crowd’ to reach fair and judicious verdicts, groups can also produce conformist behavior, which may introduce biases into the decision-making process. Indeed, we find that subjects—Victims and Jurors alike—swiftly conform to groups’ punitive preferences, changing their own punishment behaviors by as much as 40 percentage points. Across all studies, this conformity effect scales linearly, such that individuals incrementally increase punishment as the proportion of punishers within the group grows larger. This indicates that individuals are integrating the group’s preference into their valuation of punishment, a conclusion that is additionally supported by the results of our computational model.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>43985</offset><text>Though foundational theories of conformity have long invoked the metaphor of information processing, little work has actually examined how individuals integrate others’ preferences into their own values as they are making choices. Therefore, by modeling decision-making as an information integration process, we extend a rich body of research on social influence by contributing three major insights into the cognitive dynamics that give rise to conformity. First, choosing in a group context causes individuals to become less cautious and more impulsive about their choices, making them especially susceptible to relinquishing moral responsibility and exhibiting conformist behavior. Second, being exposed to a group’s punitive preference amplifies how much an individual weighs evidence that punishment is a valuable mechanism for enacting justice. Third, groups are able to exert strong influence over individuals’ punitive behaviors regardless of individuals’ preexisting preferences for punishment. Specifically, despite Victims having an overall bias favoring compensatory responses over punitive ones (meaning that they do not seem to intrinsically value punishment), groups still can cause them to behave punitively.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>45218</offset><text>These data suggest that punitive preferences are not held as sacred moral values. Instead, these results support an account in which decisions to punish a perpetrator are flexibly implemented, regardless of who is making those decisions and what the stakes of the choices are. By leveraging a computational model, we reveal two cognitive mechanisms explaining why both Victims and Jurors conform. First, both Victims and Jurors lowered their decision threshold when choosing in group contexts, which made them more susceptible to group influence because they were making less cautious and more impulsive choices. Second, as groups became increasingly punitive, they caused Victims and Jurors to value punishment more, as reflected by the growing drift rate.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>45976</offset><text>The model, however, also reveals critical differences in how Victims and Jurors are influenced by groups. First, unlike Jurors, Victims are predisposed to a compensatory (non-punitive) response regardless of how unfair the offer was. This finding has clear implications for judicial bodies, as they may be inclined to punish perpetrators more than the victims themselves would desire. Second, the rate at which Jurors integrate social information indicates that they weigh the group’s punitive preferences less than Victims. Third, Jurors, unlike Victims, actively incorporate information about the violation severity in their decision. This exquisite sensitivity of Jurors to the severity of violations is particularly interesting in the context of the principle of proportionality and legal debates on the role of victim impact statements on jury decisions. Therefore, although Jurors also conformed to the group’s punitive preference, they were more sensitive to the degree of the fairness violation and more resistant to use the group as a source of information about the value of punishment.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>47077</offset><text>By demonstrating that groups can alter a victim or juror’s desire to punish a perpetrator, our data carry real-world implications for how mediators (such as ombudsmen and victim advocacy organizations) may influence their constituents’ preferences for justice restoration, and for how individuals serving on a jury may conform to fellow jurors’ punitive preferences. Indeed, our results point to a key vulnerability in decision-making that sets the stage for conformity, especially since our findings were not limited to fairness violations, but also extended to more serious crimes, such as assault and theft. Real-world social decisions depend on recurrent interactions between individuals that can result in cascading conformity effects. A small majority within the group could cause individuals to lower their decision threshold and conform to the majority opinion, thereby creating progressively larger majorities that provide stronger and stronger evidence for punishment’s value. Although it is difficult to obtain field data quantifying the extent to which conformity effects shift real jurors’ punitive inclinations, our results help to explain why conformity may be commonplace in jury deliberation: we can readily and repeatedly induce the same conformist behaviors in naïve subjects, modify the rate at which subjects punish by manipulating the proportion of people endorsing punishment within a group, and explain how social influence impacts specific cognitive mechanisms involved in decisions to punish.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>48607</offset><text>Of course, many questions still remain. For example, future work should examine how the strength of social influence changes when individuals repeatedly interact with the same perpetrators, especially when those perpetrators can learn to reform their behaviors over time. Given the theorized role of altruistic punishment in the enforcement and spread of prosocial behaviors like cooperation, it is possible that conforming to a group’s punitive preferences might cease once an individual perceives that a perpetrator has been successfully rehabilitated. Repeated interactions with perpetrators will also allow researchers to build upon literature characterizing social influence and attitude change as learning processes. This may reveal that, depending on how much decision ambiguity they are able to resolve, individuals modulate their willingness to conform to a group by drawing upon previously-learned social knowledge. While real-world punishment decisions are undoubtedly informed by a variety of factors, our experiments reveal the potency of groups in swaying an individual’s punitive preferences by providing individuals with evidence that punishment is a socially-valued method of restoring justice.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>49823</offset><text>Methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>49831</offset><text>Subjects</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>49840</offset><text>In Experiments 1–4, 176 subjects were recruited from Brown University and the surrounding community.

Based on a scale where 1 = not suspicious at all and 6 = very suspicious, high suspicion was operationalized a priori as a rating of 5 or higher.

The subject pool was restricted to IP addresses from the United States, and to workers who had completed ≥50 HITs with ≥95% HIT approval rate. Due to concerns about data quality on mTurk, subjects were required to provide a free-response answer to the open-ended prompt: “In your own words, please define the word crime.

Player As were represented by photographs of faces in order to enhance believability of the social deception manipulation.

The number of Reverse responses from other Player Bs was parametrically varied such that zero to four partners reversed on each trial out of a fixed total of four partners, and every permutation was presented. Responses to highly unfair offers (8/2 and 9/1 splits to Player B) were sampled at twice the frequency as responses to mildly unfair offers (6/4 and 7/3 splits). In total, subjects completed 96 trials in the Group Phase of the study. Subjects had up to eight seconds to make a choice, after which the computer automatically selected the Accept option and moved on to the next trial. Prior to beginning either the Solo Phase or the Group Phase, subjects completed verbal quizzes to ensure that they understood all the rules of the game and were given an opportunity to ask any questions before beginning the task. After completing both the Solo and Group Phases of the experiment, subjects completed a demographic survey, were probed for suspicion that their partners might not be real, and were debriefed.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_3</infon><offset>58231</offset><text>Experiments 3–4: Victim and Juror DDM</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>58271</offset><text>Experiment 3 (Victim DDM) closely resembles Experiment 1 (Last Decider) with the following major differences. First, subjects could only choose between the Compensation and Reverse options; response key mapping was counterbalanced across subjects and remained consistent across trials and task phases for each subject. Second, Alone trials were intermixed with Group trials. Subjects completed a total of 420 trials in the Group Phase, of which 375 were Group trials and 45 were Alone trials. Third, offers from Player As were drawn from bounded uniform distributions in 10¢ increments, such that Mildly Unfair offers ranged from $3.70-$4.90, Somewhat Unfair offers ranged from $1.90-$3.10, and Highly Unfair offers ranged from $0.10-$1.30. Once a subject made a response, they were shown a feedback screen showing the outcome of their choice (i.e. the amount of money Player A and Player B would receive based on Player B’s decision). Fourth, photographs of group members were replaced with images of blue dots to avoid potential confounds associated with the use of face stimuli. Fifth, subjects were presented with the entire group’s votes simultaneously in order to capture the decision-making process in its entirety. Finally, all subjects saw the same predetermined fully-randomized trial sequence.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>59581</offset><text>Because DDM is sensitive to reaction time outliers, we excluded trials in which reaction times were faster than 0.3 s or slower than 5 s. This consisted of 9.88% of all trials in Experiment 3 and 4.74% of trials in Experiment 4. The 0.3 s cutoff was chosen as a conservative threshold for fast outliers based on best practices in the drift diffusion modeling literature, and also given that even the simplest perceptual discrimination decisions are rarely made faster than 0.3 s. Similarly, given that DDMs have been best characterized for relatively fast decisions of 1–1.5s, we chose to threshold slow outliers at a conservative cutoff of 5 s, which excluded a small number of trials. For consistency, both our behavioral and DDM analyses were performed on this clipped data. To further guard DDM estimates against outliers, our model assumed 5% of trials to be distributed from a uniform distribution, as opposed to the DDM likelihood. This procedure is specifically recommended by the HDDM developers as a best practice. One subject in Experiment 3 was excluded from the Highly Unfair analysis because their data contained missing cells. Mean v and a for each fairness type was calculated by adding the regression coefficient for each number of punishers (zero to four punishers) compared to deciding Alone, which we treated as the intercept.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>60940</offset><text>HDDM uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling methods to generate posterior distributions for estimated parameters; chain convergence was assessed using the Gelman-Rubin statistic (all scale reduction factors &lt;1.1), and we obtained 10,000 samples of each posterior distribution to obtain smooth parameter estimates. We tested multiple models allowing different parameters to vary according to the number of punishers within the group. The model parameters reported are from the best-fitting model that most faithfully matches the design of our task. Model selection was performed using the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC), which assesses goodness of model fit while penalizing for model complexity. Goodness of fit was also assessed using a posterior predictive check. To ensure that HDDM is capable of accurately estimating our model’s parameters, we also performed parameter recovery simulations using the parameters that were estimated for our model. Details are discussed in the Supplementary Methods.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>61951</offset><text>The procedure for Experiment 4 (Juror DDM) was identical to that of Experiment 3, with two key differences. First, because subjects were making third-party punishment decisions, we informed subjects that their choices would not affect their own monetary outcomes and required subjects to recount this information in a verbal quiz before beginning the task. Second, each subject saw a unique and fully-randomized trial sequence. The procedure used to analyze DDM results was identical to that of Experiment 3. The best-fitting model from Experiment 3 was used to estimate parameters for Experiment 4 (see Supplementary Information for details).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_3</infon><offset>62595</offset><text>Experiment 5: Crime judgments</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>62625</offset><text>Alone and Group trials were intermixed to avoid potential ordering confounds.
