While standardized tests of medical knowledge exist throughout residency and for board certification, there are no analogous technical skill assessments that are broadly adopted. Currently, judgments of surgical competence are made locally after reviewing subjective evaluations of residents by supervising faculty, and these skills assessments vary by training program and are not universally defined. Thus, the current system of assessment lacks objective benchmarks to gauge surgical proficiency and to ensure that all resident physicians across training programs are equally competent to practice autonomously by graduation. This disconnect, between certifying resident competency and the absence of standardized metrics to describe competency, puts programs at risk of misclassifying trainees as competent for independent practice when they may benefit from additional supervised practice and learning. There are several validated grading scales to measure surgical skill but these are time- and resource-intensive, subject to in-person rater biases, and largely inefficient for providing timely feedback to trainees. Standardized protocols have been proposed with small but promising validation studies utilizing wet lab and surgical simulator technologies, but have not been widely implemented for routine use. There is a crucial need to identify an effective surgical assessment tool that is minimally burdensome both in time and cost, that reduces evaluator bias, and that is scalable for use across different programs without requiring local expertise or training.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4154</offset><text>One idea gaining popularity is to outsource the procedural assessment to crowdsourced lay raters. Crowdsourcing, which employs large numbers of lay people via the internet to perform a task, represents a novel approach to standardize skill evaluations while minimizing subjective observer biases. While any individual crowd worker score may be inaccurate given their lack of expertise, crowdsourcing averages the scores of many workers to achieve “regression to the mean” of what is ideally an accurate judgment, at a much faster and cheaper scale than obtaining expert reviews. Several other surgical subspecialties including general surgery, urology, otolaryngology, and gynecology have published reports promoting crowdsourcing as comparable to expert feedback on technical skill assessments. However, most of these studies show correlation rather than equivalence of crowd and expert ratings and were almost entirely based on simulated surgery or wet lab scenarios. To date, the few study exceptions which examined crowdsourced assessments of actual surgery were limited by poor interrater reliability and reported mixed results regarding whether the crowd could distinguish novices from more experienced surgeons.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5377</offset><text>The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether crowdsourced lay raters can accurately assess ophthalmic surgical skill as compared to experts, utilizing videos of real cataract surgery rather than simulations or wet lab setups. If feasible and accurate, this technology could be used to plot out trainee progression to proficiency and to identify for whom and when educational intervention may be beneficial. Also, as the crowdsourcing approach is not faculty- or institution-specific, crowd assessments of surgery could be used to collect cohort data across training programs, and perhaps even to establish standardized metrics as skill criteria for graduation or board certification.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>6075</offset><text>MATERIALS AND METHODS</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>6097</offset><text>Study Design</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6110</offset><text>Single institution, observational prospective cohort study with two arms: cross-sectional and longitudinal.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>6218</offset><text>Setting and Participants</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6243</offset><text>Ophthalmology residents, fellows, and faculty at the home institution were invited to submit cataract phacoemulsification videos for de-identified assessment.

Arm 2 was a separate, longitudinal analysis of cataract videos for a cohort of 5 senior residents. Because residents rotate on more or less surgically busy rotations at different times during the year, videos were collected by case number (every 30 cases: 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180) rather than by date. All surgical videos recorded actual surgery cases on live patients where a single surgeon was operating for the duration of interest.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>7288</offset><text>Video Editing</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7302</offset><text>Surgery videos were anonymized regarding patient and surgeon identities, and subsequently edited to include only the phacoemulsification segment, wherein the eye’s natural lens is emulsified with an ultrasonic handpiece and aspirated from the eye.

As the phacoemulsification step ranged in time length across varying skill levels, longer video segments were truncated to the first 10 minutes to enable uploading to the Amazon Mechanical Turk crowd-worker platform (Amazon.com Inc., Seattle, WA). Video editing was performed using iMovie software (Apple Inc., Cupertino, CA) and Windows Movie Editor (Microsoft Inc., Seattle, WA).

The C-SATS platform included a brief orientation video and one comprehension test question to screen lay raters. The animated orientation video was created by C-SATS, Inc. to familiarize the reviewers with the phacoemulsification step of cataract surgery and the scoring rubric.

There are several published valid and reliable surgical competency assessments for cataract surgery, however many of them contain task-specific domains and ophthalmic technical language that could pose a barrier to crowd-sourced lay raters. Thus, the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS), the most commonly used technical skills assessment tool in surgery, was modified with the goal being a grading rubric with simplified language easily understandable to a layperson without surgical expertise. The modified OSATS tool (mOSATS) preserves 4 elements of assessment from the OSATS (economy of movement, respect for tissue, flow of operation, instrument handling) and includes a fifth element adapted from the Global Rating Assessment of Skills in Intraocular Surgery assessment tool (microscope centration) (Fig S1B). These domains overlap with content from multiple validated cataract skill assessments, and discussion with our expert raters and other local cataract surgeons established face validity for the mOSATS. Each of the 5 categories was graded on a 5-point Likert scale with defined narrative anchors at the low, middle, and high ranges of the scale. To measure overall technical skill performance, a “mean sum score” was derived for each video as the averaged summative score across the 5 categories for both the experts and crowdworkers, with a minimum and maximum score of 5 and 25, respectively.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>10871</offset><text>Statistical Analysis</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10892</offset><text>Data analyses were computed with Statistical Analysis Software V9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Interrater reliability was determined by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), specifically the Shrout-Fleiss reliability ICC which is a measure of how well groups agree as opposed to how well they correlate (two-way random average measures). ICCs were calculated for single-score or mean k scores for single versus averaged data points, respectively. Mean crowd and expert scores were compared via Pearson correlation (Pearson’s r) and matched-pair t-tests. To adjust for score clustering by crowd raters, crowd mean scores were generated with a linear mixed-effects model using an interaction term for surgical experience of trainee and rater type (lay or expert). A repeated measures model was used in the longitudinal study. Consistency was tested using an interaction term for experience as measured by case number from baseline (30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180) and by rater type (lay or expert). A stepwise regression analysis was performed to explore the strength of crowd score and surgery length (phacoemulsification segment) variables as individual and combined predictors of expert score.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>12093</offset><text>RESULTS</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>12101</offset><text>Cross-sectional Study</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>12123</offset><text>Fifty phacoemulsification video segments supplied by 15 unique physicians with varying surgical experience were graded by 5 blinded expert surgeons, yielding 250 evaluations.

This finding suggests that any individual expert performed very well but not quite as well as the average of the group. The group expert mean sum score predicted level of surgeon training (Pearson’s r = 0.860, p &lt; 0.0001) establishing construct validity for the mOSATS (Fig 1B). The expert group took 21 days to complete the 50 video evaluations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>12948</offset><text>A total of 2507 evaluations of the same 50 videos were furnished by 347 distinct, individual crowdworkers.

The median number of crowd evaluations per video was 45 (range 41-49). The crowd scores demonstrated poor individual interrater reliability with an ICC for individual crowd workers of 0.015, as compared with 0.891 for individual experts (Fig 1A). Nonetheless, the crowd performed much better as a group than as individuals as seen from the crowd mean ICC of 0.823. The mean crowd sum score had a moderately positive correlation with level of surgeon training (r = 0.729, p &lt; 0.0001) which suggests that lay raters can reasonably assess surgical skill (Fig 1C), but not as reliably as the experts (r = 0.860 versus r = 0.729).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>13872</offset><text>The averaged mean sum score across all 50 videos was higher for the crowd as compared with the experts, and the lowest average score given was 16.5 by the crowd versus 5.2 by the experts (Fig 1B-C), indicating grade inflation by the crowd.

The ICC for the expert versus crowd mean sum scores for these 50 videos was −0.091, demonstrating statistically that the gap between the scores is large. Examining the mean sum scores for the videos grouped by level of experience showed a similar pattern: crowd mean sum scores were consistently higher than expert mean scores for first, second, and third year residents (p &lt; 0.0001, paired t-test; Fig 1F). In addition, crowd versus expert scores for the PGY5 fellows approached but did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.055), possibly due to an underpowered sample size (n = 6).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>15277</offset><text>Independently of crowd score, longer surgery duration (as defined by the duration of phacoemulsification) was strongly correlated with both lower training level (r =−0.855, p &lt; 0.001; Fig 2A) and lower expert mean sum score (r = −0.927, p &lt; 0.0001; Fig 2B). In a stepwise regression analysis to predict expert mean sum score, surgery length was a better predictor variable than crowd mean sum score. While both crowd score and surgery length were highly correlated with expert score (r = 0.865 and −0.927, respectively), neither metric alone predicted expert score very accurately. To determine whether using both metrics together could better predict expert score, a regression equation to convert crowd score plus surgery length into a predicted score was derived from the cross-sectional data. The equation was as follows: Predicted Expert Mean = −11.18 + −0.018*video_length (in seconds) + 1.643*crowd_score. This equation generated a predicted score that more closely approximated the real expert score when utilizing both crowd score and surgery length (r2 = 0.92) (Fig 2C) as compared to using crowd score alone (r2 = 0.75) or surgery length alone (r2 = 0.86). The final prediction model fit the actual data well, with differences between real (mean expert) and predicted values varying within +/−3 points on the 25-point scale (Fig 2C). The predicted values and real expert mean scores displayed excellent correlation (r = 0.959, p &lt; 0.0001) (Fig 2D), outperforming the accuracy of crowd scores alone (Fig 1D-E).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>16810</offset><text>Longitudinal Study</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>16829</offset><text>Five resident surgeons provided phacoemulsification videos at 6 distinct time points in training (30th cataract case, 60th case, 90th case, 120th case, 150th case, and 180th case).

The ICC for the expert versus crowd mean sum scores for these 28 videos was low at −0.33, indicating a very large numerical score gap.

This predictive accuracy from using the regression equation derived from the first data set on the independent second data set suggests robustness of our model. Combining the 2 datasets of videos and plotting the residuals (observed minus predicted expert sum score, as predicted from crowd sum score) for the combined dataset revealed the crowd systematically inflates scores for low performers (Fig S2); this biased, non-random residual pattern (heteroscedasticity) demonstrates how looking only at correlation (r and r2) can be misleading and highlights the importance of first checking other statistical measures to validate the model.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>20563</offset><text>Student Rater Analysis</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>20586</offset><text>We further hypothesized that non-surgeon lay raters with more exposure or training could outperform lay raters with no or minimal training.

In addition, our crowd and expert mean scores were highly correlated, similar to other crowdsourced assessment studies. However, measures of correlation alone ignore the difference between absolute expert and crowd mean scores. Correlation does not describe the actual agreement between data, and is frequently misused to proclaim equivalence. In particular, the crowd tended to give inflated scores to novice and intermediate surgeons. The crowd and expert scores were thus significantly different at lower levels of surgical experience, then tended to converge as experience increased, suggesting that the crowd was not able to discern beginner surgeons from accomplished ones. As a result, this crowdsourced platform did not demonstrate construct validity in the assessment of videotaped cataract surgery. In contrast to the crowd, the “student raters” in our study more closely matched expert scores and use of the entire grading scale range, with a correspondingly high ICC showing agreement. This may suggest that the subject matter (phaco technical skill) is too complex or nuanced for lay raters to assess with sufficient sensitivity, rather than a failure of crowdsourced assessment.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>23648</offset><text>Study Strengths</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>23664</offset><text>Our expert panel demonstrated excellent interrater reliability (ICC) while utilizing the full grading scale.

Blinded expert review of videos reduced the potential of cognitive biases that may affect in-person evaluation, e.g., halo effect, by attendings who are familiar with and are simultaneously supervising the resident surgeon. In comparison with other studies of crowdsourced skill assessments, our study reports the univariate data and compares absolute values and spread (range), rather than focusing on correlation. We argue that the validity of the metric should be based on equivalence rather than correlation and presenting the data this way reveals large discrepancies between crowd and expert scores, especially for trainee surgeons for whom this technology was intended. We report the outcomes of two separate studies, cross-sectional and longitudinal performance, in which the second data set independently reproduced the score patterns seen in the first data set. The expert scores from the longitudinal study traced the learning curve for individual trainees. Despite a limited dataset with 5-6 data points per trainee, our data mirrored prior seminal work suggesting an inflection point for increased phaco efficiency and decreased vitreous loss complications after a resident’s first 80 cases. While our particular group did not have a surgically challenged resident, this model may potentially detect an individual whose trajectory lags behind peers and thus may benefit from customized additional training.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>25416</offset><text>While crowd scores did not replicate expert scores, the close correlation prompted us to look for other variables that could improve upon crowd scores. Regression analysis suggested that time spent in surgery was a reliable indicator of skill level, and that the combination of crowd score and surgery length (as defined by the duration of phacoemulsification) was a better estimator of actual expert score than crowd score alone. Employing multiple variables to approximate expert evaluation proved to be a robust model. Applying the regression equation derived from the first data set to the second, independent set of surgery videos predicted the actual expert score with reasonable accuracy. This novel “conversion factor” will need to be tested in future studies to ascertain its reproducibility and generalizability to other surgical skill sets. Also, we would caution that faster surgery is not necessarily better, as it takes skill to be simultaneously fast and good at surgery. Our results likely reflect that less skilled learners moved more hesitantly and took time to consider next steps in comparison to more experienced surgeons.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>26564</offset><text>Study Limitations</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>26582</offset><text>This study utilized a grading rubric with a global performance score based on 5 domains addressing general procedural elements, none of which were cataract specific. The objective of this study was to explore the feasibility and validity of crowdsourced assessments for cataract surgery, so in order to facilitate lay rater comprehension, the grading scale was intentionally less technically specialized than other more granular, cataract-specific assessment tools. Locally-developed granular assessments tailored to each training program will still play an important role in guiding resident education, whereas the implementation of an accessible, standardized skill evaluation tool like this one may better fulfill universal accreditation requirements and our profession’s social contract with the public. A followup study is ongoing to examine the relative contribution of each of the 5 mOSATS domains to the crowd and expert scores, as well as analysis of the free-text expert rater comments using natural language processing techniques to determine what specific surgical steps residents are excelling at or need further practice.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27720</offset><text>Our study evaluated only the phaco segment as proof of concept for crowdsourced assessment. While phacoemulsification is a critical skill for ophthalmic surgeons, there are many more technical elements, as well as surgical judgment, clinical acumen, and patient counseling components of cataract and other ocular surgery, which are equally important yet outside the scope of this study. Encouragingly, work done by other researchers indicates that skill assessments for specific tasks such as phaco or capsulorrhexis are highly predictive of overall technical skill. This suggests that trainee global surgical progression could be monitored using select rubric items.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28388</offset><text>Other limitations of our longitudinal study included a relatively small sample size of 5 surgeons and 2 missing video time points. We did not standardize cases by nuclear density or dictate a specific phaco technique. But these limitations also signal one of this study’s strengths: that we examined real-world, actual surgery cases while leveraging existing workflows (routine video recording when available). In surgical training programs, more complex cases are typically assigned to more experienced trainees, decreasing the likelihood that more experienced surgeons received higher scores due to “easier” cataracts. As ophthalmology residency programs are relatively small compared to residencies like general surgery, our class size of 5 residents per year (a medium-sized program) provides compelling pilot data to inspire a future multisite collaborative study. Another challenge of this study was the need to manually segment the videos, although promising investigations on machine learning to discern phases of cataract surgery imply this may soon become a historical problem. Finally, an important limitation of this study was the use of a private company’s platform (C-SATS) to obtain the crowd evaluations, which may be financially prohibitive for training programs. The cost of directly contracting with crowdworkers via Amazon Mechanical Turk marketplace, which would not benefit from the C-SATS platform ease of use, was estimated at $46 to $96 per video for ~46 crowd evaluations (derived from an estimated Turker rate of $0.10 to $0.25 per minute ($6 to $15 per hour), plus an additional 20% markup by Amazon). Nevertheless, when considered on a per resident cost basis, even $100 per graduating resident for one standardized cataract surgery assessment appears reasonable next to the Ophthalmic Knowledge Assessment Program (OKAP in-service exam: $395 per resident per year), the written qualifying exam (WQE: $1950), and the oral board exam ($ 1950).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>30368</offset><text>Future Work</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>30380</offset><text>How can the crowd method be improved to better match the experts? Our student rater example suggests that simply educating crowdworkers, via repeated exposure to surgery videos and/or structured tutorials describing operative technique, may improve identification of lower performers as compared to naïve crowd raters. While there will probably still be some compromise in accuracy, crowdsourcing has the benefit of faster turnaround; in this study and earlier crowdsourcing assessment studies, expert panels took days to weeks to return the evaluations, whereas the crowd took a matter of hours. Since the majority of ophthalmology resident surgical experience usually occurs in the final year of training, accurate assessments with swift feedback are essential to maximize the limited time remaining for remediation before the expected graduation date. Another reasonable strategy might be to develop or utilize existing reading centers for surgical evaluations. A recent study showed that reading center graders were nearly as reliable and accurate as experts for assessment of oculoplastic morphological outcomes, whereas crowdsourced lay observers were less accurate and consistent despite a strong overall correlation between the three groups. Reading centers may be more time- and cost-effective than experts while more reliable than naïve crowdworkers, and could represent a feasible middle ground.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>31789</offset><text>Alternatively, artificial intelligence may play an increasing role in assessment. In theory, deep learning algorithms can be trained to detect distinct signatures of operative technique that experts intuit, such as speed or confidence of phaco tip movements. Objective skill assessments for specific tasks are already available on cataract simulators with built-in modules, some of which have been shown to discriminate novice from expert surgical proficiency and, once mastered in the simulated setting, may lead to improved live surgical performance by trainees.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>32354</offset><text>A major motivating factor in designing this study was to derive a faster, cheaper, more feasible standardized surgical assessment than expert review. While crowdsourcing at face value clearly has limitations as described in this study, strategies to refine the output, such as training the crowd or combining crowd scores with other surgery metrics, may enable this technology to still play a role in standardizing surgical assessment for resident education. If every resident across the country submitted their de-identified 100th cataract case to a national registry for standardized assessment, it could generate a large cohort data set via which real competency benchmarks may be developed. This could ensure uniformity with an accepted standard of surgical competence for graduating residents that is currently lacking. It could be the surgical skills equivalent of the OKAP in-service exam that tests medical knowledge at specific time points in residency training and compares trainee performance against their peers. It may even allow for personalized training plans, as individual residents may reach the competence benchmark sooner or later than the 86 cataract cases assigned by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>33610</offset><text>Important future work for this and similar studies will entail linking the validated skill assessments to patient-related outcomes. A landmark study examining blinded expert review of videos by practicing bariatric surgeons found that lower peer ratings of skill were significantly associated with longer operations and higher complication rates. Recently, patient outcomes in laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy were shown to be associated with variations in surgical techniques as measured by blinded peer review of intraoperative videos. Additionally, there is evidence for skill in one surgical procedure predicting skill in other surgical domains, suggesting that there is generalizability to this type of assessment. Similar work could be done in ophthalmology and other procedural fields, however, scalability will depend on fostering the optimal assessment infrastructure that integrates into existing workflows while capitalizing on new technologies, such as machine learning.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>34592</offset><text>Implications</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>34605</offset><text>Our study builds upon and refines conclusions from prior crowdsourcing assessment studies and suggests exciting avenues for further research, including bolstering crowd score accuracy via other variables such as duration of surgery, training the crowd for better accuracy, and a possible role for reading centers as an economic yet reliable alternative.

The data presented here show that while crowdsourced scores of surgical skill correlated well with the gold standard of expert scores, these methods are not equivalent as the crowd consistently overestimated technical competency. This trend was observed across two independent data sets of surgical videos, and the crowd-expert score discrepancy was particularly pronounced in the group of trainee surgeons whom we as educators are most interested in accurately assessing proficiency. Interestingly, a regression model that adjusted crowd scores based on surgery duration produced a surprisingly accurate predictive model for surgical skill as compared to expert scores. We believe this topic deserves further study as a means of facilitating crowdsourced assessment of surgical proficiency for reliable documentation of trainee progression and standardization of surgical assessment.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>36241</offset><text>Supplementary Material</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>36264</offset><text>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>36290</offset><text>Supplementary material associated with this article can be found in the online version at doi:10.1016/j.jsurg.2021.02.004.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>36413</offset><text>Declarations of interest: none relevant to this study.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>36468</offset><text>Meeting Presentation: Presented in part at Educating the Educators – Association of University Professors of Ophthalmology (AUPO) in January 2020 and The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) in April 2019.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>36699</offset><text>Data sharing: Grading data from experts and the crowd will be freely available.

3 years of residency training. For the cross-sectional study arm ⊗ (n = 50): A: Reliability of blinded expert raters and crowd raters: Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), a measure of rater reliability by agreement as opposed to correlation, is shown for the sum scores of the experts and crowdworkers from the cross-sectional study. When scores are averaged across each group (mean ICC), the crowd performs nearly as well as experts, but the individual crowdworkers perform poorly in comparison with individual experts (individual ICC). B: Expert mean sum scores accurately predicted surgeon level of training, establishing construct validity for the modified OSATS grading rubric (Pearson’s r = 0.860, p &lt; 0.0001). C: Crowd mean sum score also correlates with surgeon level (r = 0.729, p &lt; 0.0001) but not as well as the experts. The crowd used a narrow range of the grading scale weighted toward superior scores for all surgeons with a correspondingly elevated group mean, as compared to the experts (B) who utilized the full scoring range with a group mean close to the mid-range (Average-Maximum-Minimum plots). D: Crowd and expert mean scores were highly correlated (r = 0.865, p&lt;0.0001), but failed to show good absolute value agreement (perfect agreement would plot linearly along y = x). E: Crowd and expert mean scores for individual surgery videos show discordance especially for videos given lower scores by the experts. F: Crowd mean scores were higher than expert scores for first, second, and third year residents (p&lt;0.0001, paired t-test) and approached borderline significance for the PGY5 fellows (p = 0.055, paired t-test). PGY: postgraduate year. Ophthalmology residency begins in PGY2 after a year of general internship training. Table lists group means for each level of surgeon experience.

B: Longer surgery length was strongly correlated with lower expert mean score (r = −0.927, p&lt;0.0001). C-D: A regression equation to convert crowd score plus surgery length into predicted expert score was derived from the cross-sectional data (Predicted Expert Mean = −11.18 + −0.018*video_length_in_seconds + 1.643*crowdscore). This equation generated a predicted score (green markers) that more closely approximated actual expert score (blue markers) (r2 = 0.92) than did crowd score alone (red markers) as illustrated by (C) absolute values and (D) correlation plots (n = 50, r = 0.959, p &lt; 0.0001).</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">nihms-1674550-f0003.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F3</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>43277</offset><text>Longitudinal cohort reproduces correlation of expert scores with crowd scores and with surgery duration, and validates predictive model for estimating expert score. For the longitudinal study arm Ⓛ (n = 28): A: Crowd mean scores correlated with expert scores (r = 0.792, p &lt; 0.0001). B: Resident physicians gain surgical experience with increasing case number, as measured by the blinded expert assessments. Similar to the cross-sectional study, crowd scores do not agree with expert scores and demonstrate significant over-estimation of skill for beginner-intermediate surgeons as compared to expert scores (30th-120th cases: p &lt; 0.05, paired t-test) leading to higher averaged mean scores and a constricted grading range as compared to expert scores. Table lists group means for each level of surgeon experience. Error bars indicate standard deviation. C: Surgery length (as defined by phacoemulsification duration) inversely correlates with resident experience (r = −0.827, p &lt; 0.0001). Hashed lines connect time points separated by missing data points to show overall trends. D: Longer surgery duration (mean of residents) was strongly correlated with lower expert mean sum score (r = −0.845, p &lt; 0.0001). E-F: When applied to the independent longitudinal data set, the regression equation derived from the cross-sectional data set yields a predicted score that closely approximates the expert score (r2 = 0.80) as illustrated by (E) absolute values and (F) correlation plots (n = 28, r = 0.896, p &lt; 0.0001).
