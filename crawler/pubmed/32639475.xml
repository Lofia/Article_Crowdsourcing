A recent systematic review of mental health symptoms in mothers and fathers of children with CHD found that over 80% exhibit post-traumatic stress symptoms, 30–80% experience severe psychological distress, and 25–50% have depression and/or anxiety. Preventing mental health problems in parents of children with CHD is critically important, as parent mental health can exert a significant influence on family and child well-being.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2509</offset><text>Prior studies described the experiences and needs of mothers raising a child with CHD, with the goal of identifying strategies to prevent and intervene upon maternal mental health challenges. Research has also begun to examine the collective parental experience, including a recent study by Sood et al.. Results identified a host of common parental stressors (e.g., insufficient preparation for the impact of CHD, inadequate support networks), yet brought to light some differences in the ways mothers and fathers experience the stress of raising a child with CHD. For example, fathers were more likely than were mothers to describe stress from not being able to protect their child from CHD and from difficulties balancing employment with the care of their family. In response, the present study used online crowdsourcing, an innovative methodology that engages an online community to generate ideas and solve problems, to specifically examine sources of stress for fathers of children with CHD and opportunities for intervention to prevent or reduce paternal mental health problems.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>3594</offset><text>Materials and Methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3616</offset><text>The current report is from a larger qualitative study of 108 parents of children with CHD using crowdsourcing methodology. Inclusion criteria were having a child born with CHD one to seven years prior who underwent open-heart surgery during infancy, being able to read and write in English, and access to the internet on a computer, tablet, or mobile device. An announcement about the larger study along with the direct link to a brief REDCap survey was posted to the social media pages of several CHD-specific non-profit organizations within the United States (e.g., Pediatric Congenital Heart Association, Mended Little Hearts). The REDCap survey collected basic demographic and clinical information (parent gender, race, ethnicity, and education level; United States region and community characteristics; child age and CHD type) along with an email address from parents interested in participating in the study. Two hundred and forty nine parents completed the survey over a one-week period. Using an algorithm that considered the frequencies of each demographic and clinical characteristic among those who completed the survey along with the demographics of the United States population, a subset of parents (N = 179) who represented the greatest diversity in backgrounds and experiences were then invited to review the electronic consent form for the larger study through REDCap and enroll in the study. Of these, 108 parents participated in the larger study, and 70 parents who submitted responses specifically regarding sources of stress and opportunities for intervention for fathers of children with CHD were included in the present analyses. This study was reviewed and approved by the Nemours Institutional Review Board prior to initiating study procedures, with a waiver of written documentation of informed consent to allow for an electronic consent process.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5488</offset><text>A stakeholder advisory council consisting of four CHD parents (three mothers, one father) and six medical and mental health providers convened twice per month by phone throughout the duration of the study to identify domains important for family-based psychosocial care for CHD (e.g., support for fathers), advise decisions regarding study methodology, and refine study questions. Two additional CHD fathers were added to the advisory council after the completion of data collection to assist with qualitative analyses related to sources of stress and opportunities for intervention for fathers of children with CHD.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>6105</offset><text>Participants</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6118</offset><text>Participants were 70 parents (25 fathers, 45 mothers) of young children with CHD who submitted responses regarding sources of stress and opportunities for intervention for fathers of children with CHD as part of the larger study.

Crowdsourcing is the process of generating ideas and solving problems by soliciting contributions from large online communities. Although crowdsourcing has been used extensively in business, information technology, and more recently public health, the application of crowdsourcing to qualitative research related to pediatric health is innovative. Three prior published papers of which we are aware have described the use of online crowdsourcing methodology to conduct qualitative research aimed at understanding the lived experiences of families impacted by pediatric illness.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7334</offset><text>Participants were invited to set up a deidentified account on Yammer and to join a private online group. Thirty-seven open-ended study questions were drafted by the study team, reviewed and revised by the stakeholder advisory council, and then posted to the online group over a six-month period. Three study questions specifically targeted fathers’ experiences and needs and were worded differently for fathers versus mothers (e.g., for fathers: “What specific challenges have you faced as a ‘heart dad?’ How do you think your experience has been different from the experience of your wife/partner, if applicable?” and for mothers: “What specific challenges have you watched your husband/partner face as a ‘heart dad,’ if applicable? In your opinion, what are some ways that his experience has differed from yours?”). All other study questions were designed to be relevant to both genders (e.g., “What losses have you experienced, if any, and how have they impacted you and your family?”).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>8346</offset><text>Parents responded to study questions through the Yammer app on their tablet/mobile device, by logging on to the website or by replying to an automated email corresponding with each post. Questions had a suggested deadline of one week, although responses were accepted for all questions throughout the six-month period of data collection. Parents could view each other’s deidentified responses and “like” or comment on others’ responses, and all such dialogue were included as qualitative data. Parents were paid for their participation at the end of each month via reloadable study debit card ($3 per question response; up to $24 per month).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>8996</offset><text>Data Analysis</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9010</offset><text>Qualitative data were analyzed using an inductive thematic approach, focused on subjective perceptions, feelings, and experiences. Parent responses to open-ended questions and dialogue between participants were extracted from Yammer and uploaded into Dedoose Version 8 (SocioCultural Research Consultants, LLC, Los Angeles, CA). The analytical process was conducted in two stages. First, all data from the larger study were coded as part of an iterative process led by a four-person coding team, with input from the stakeholder advisory council. In order to establish inter-coder reliability, the team independently coded four participants’ complete responses (0.81–0.90 pooled Cohen’s kappa coefficient), after which disagreements regarding codes were resolved through reflection and discussion. Responses from the remaining participants were then divided among the coders for independent coding. Next, using only the content from the fathers code, an analytical team consisting of two psychologists and three CHD fathers with lived experience, using a methodology similar to Locock et al, collectively reviewed the responses of all 70 participants to identify common themes regarding sources of stress for fathers of children with CHD and opportunities for intervention to prevent or reduce paternal mental health problems. Themes were shared with parent participants via Yammer to check for accuracy and resonance with their experiences, and feedback was incorporated into qualitative analyses.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>10514</offset><text>Results</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10522</offset><text>Participants (N = 70) were diverse with regard to U.S. region, education level, and household income (Table 1).

Participants’ children with CHD tended to be medically complex, with the majority having undergone multiple cardiac surgeries (75.7%). Five (7.1%) children died prior to their parent’s participation in this study.

Participants often noted that the fathers’ prescribed role was to “stay strong” for their family and to limit their emotional expression of fear, sadness, and grief. This made it more challenging for fathers to ask for help and to admit that they were struggling to cope with their child’s diagnosis. Many participants also described the father’s traditionally prescribed role as the protector of the family, which resulted in fathers feeling powerless when they were not able to protect their CHD child. Some fathers noted that they were not interested in additional supports, as they believed that obtaining support for themselves could take needed attention away from their child or the child’s mother. Multiple participants perceived a widespread belief among the care team that mothers need more support than fathers, which resulted in less outreach to fathers and made fathers feel excluded by the care team. For example, many participants reported that care providers discussed the impact of CHD on mothers without acknowledging fathers, even when fathers were present. Some fathers also described comments by care providers about their role being to support the mother and/or support the family financially, which contributed to fathers’ perceptions that their experiences were not understood by the care team.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_3</infon><offset>12930</offset><text>Opportunity for Intervention: Acknowledge and Normalize the Impact of CHD on Fathers</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>13015</offset><text>To begin to address these sources of stress, participants recommended that care providers make a concerted effort to speak to the impact of CHD on both caregivers and recognize common gender differences without making assumptions of an individual’s need based on gender. Participants also suggested normalizing the impact of CHD on fathers in a noninvasive manner by providing written information specific to the father experience within the hospital setting (e.g., informational handouts). Participants noted that doing so may raise awareness regarding the impact of CHD on fathers, provide education without fathers having to request it, and foster an environment in which it is okay to ask for help.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>13720</offset><text>Balancing Work and Family Responsibilities</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>13763</offset><text>Intertwined with societal expectations for fatherhood, participants reported that fathers often managed the majority of family responsibilities outside of the hospital, especially income generation. Most fathers worked throughout the hospitalization to support the family, while also managing other essential activities (e.g., managing finances, caring for siblings). These responsibilities limited their ability to be present at the hospital and led to feelings of guilt and disconnectedness from their child’s care. When fathers were at the hospital, many reported feeling less engaged, as they perceived that the child’s mother had stronger relationships with the care team. Similar challenges were reported in outpatient settings, as fathers frequently missed appointments due to work, thereby receiving information second hand from the mother.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_3</infon><offset>14616</offset><text>Opportunity for Intervention: Provide Support for Balancing Work/Family Responsibilities</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>14705</offset><text>Participants suggested that hospitals provide accommodations enabling parents to work remotely, such as designated work spaces or increased access to Wi-Fi. Participants also noted that creating opportunities for fathers to meet and discuss how they have supported their families (e.g., managing time off and/or caring for other siblings during hospital stays) may decrease feelings of powerlessness. Participants recommended the creation of new means for communication between care providers and fathers, such as posting medical information online/through a secure app, utilizing video chat with fathers at work during bedside rounds, providing medical updates to fathers even when information has already been shared with the mothers, and hosting educational meetings that may be of interest to fathers. Participants also suggested the formation of financial assistance programs that would enable fathers to take time off from work without incurring additional financial burden.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>15686</offset><text>Feeling Overlooked as a Partner in Care</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>15726</offset><text>Another prominent theme for fathers was feeling overlooked as a partner in their child’s care. Many participants described feeling as though the father’s input was not valued at the same level as the mother’s. Several fathers discussed needing to demonstrate engagement and earn the level of respect from the care team that mothers are naturally afforded. Participants often discussed how fathers were treated as less knowledgeable than mothers, and that even when the father was present in the room, all information was directed towards the mother. Feeling overlooked as a partner also extended to hospital accommodations that inadvertently excluded fathers. For example, one father described their child’s room as only having bedding for one parent, which meant that he had to stay elsewhere. Another discussed limited support in caring for siblings, which meant that the father often left the room with siblings while important information was communicated to the mother.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_3</infon><offset>16709</offset><text>Opportunity for Intervention: Recognize and Promote Father Knowledge and Engagement</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>16793</offset><text>Participants recommended increasing the care team’s awareness of the father’s role, limiting individual assumptions based on gender, and emphasizing that input from fathers be valued along with input from mothers.

For example, many participants stated that online supports and peer-to-peer groups often address “heart moms” without acknowledging the presence of fathers, which may result in fathers feeling overlooked and less likely to utilize these supports. Similarly, participants often noted that during interactions with care teams, care providers would ask the mother how she is doing and offer support, without providing similar check-ins with fathers. When father-specific supports do exist, participants noted that they often have low attendance and levels of engagement.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_3</infon><offset>18034</offset><text>Opportunity for Intervention: Provide Formal and Informal Supports for CHD Fathers</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>18117</offset><text>Participant recommendations included developing more online support groups for fathers and increasing the number of peer-to-peer groups. However, responses were variable. Some participants stated that groups would have drastically changed their experiences, while others reported that they would not likely engage in an open discussion of their emotions. Those who were not interested in support groups noted that they would have utilized more informal opportunities to engage with other fathers, such as assisting with or coordinating events for other families of children with CHD (e.g., room set-up, volunteering at charity runs). Other suggestions included providing opportunities for couples to meet in smaller groups or sponsoring events for casual socialization, such as watch parties for sports, where conversations about CHD can be interspersed with other topics. Some noted that these events should be strategically planned to involve fathers in a way that helps them feel empowered and not vulnerable, which allows for information to be disseminated without fathers feeling “weak.” Finally, participants spoke about the value of having clinical social workers and psychologists present, which would provide an opportunity for more private support and discussion regarding how caregivers can support themselves and each other.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>19458</offset><text>Discussion</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>19469</offset><text>This study is the first to our knowledge to engage a geographically diverse sample of CHD fathers and mothers to specifically examine sources of stress for fathers of children with CHD and opportunities for intervention to prevent or reduce paternal mental health problems. Our results extend what was previously known about how fathers experience and respond to the stress of CHD. The four broad themes are interconnected and bidirectional. For example, societal expectations for the role of fathers in caregiving and a limited ability for fathers to be present at the hospital due to outside work and family demands can influence assumptions made by the care team regarding a father’s role in his child’s CHD care. These assumptions can impact how care providers interact with fathers, which may result in fathers feeling overlooked as partners in care and, in some cases, disengaging from care. This is a critical issue, as paternal involvement in the care of infants and children with chronic illness has been associated with positive health effects, better medical regimen adherence, higher child health-related quality of life, and greater family resilience, including more positive ratings of the marital relationship and family environment. However, involvement in care may look different for fathers as compared to mothers, and applying the same definition and metrics of parental involvement may mask important differences in the role and meaning of maternal and paternal parenting behavior.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>20975</offset><text>Study results are consistent with prior research on the experiences and needs of fathers in other illness groups. Fathers of infants in neonatal units have reported similar feelings of powerlessness and exclusion in the care of their infant, and noted expectations to fulfill traditional roles of “being strong” and working to support the family. Fathers of children with severe cerebral palsy described similar challenges balancing employment with the care of their child and feeling overlooked in their child’s care due to assumptions made by the care team regarding the father’s role. A recent review of studies on fathers’ perceptions of parenting a child with a developmental disability revealed that fathers experience difficulty obtaining health information about their children due to limited understanding by health professionals about the types of information important to fathers. It seems likely that the broad themes identified in the present study represent sources of stress for fathers across pediatric illness groups and healthcare settings and that opportunities for intervention identified by parents in this study may reach beyond CHD.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>22141</offset><text>Recommendations generated from parent participants in this study include the need for increased awareness (e.g., of the impact of CHD on fathers, of the important role of fathers in their child’s care), communication (e.g., with fathers directly rather than indirectly through mothers), resources (e.g., hospital accommodations enabling fathers to work remotely or sleep near the child/family), and supports (e.g., in a manner that helps fathers feel empowered rather than vulnerable). Consistent with recent recommendations by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Family Initiative’s International Neonatal Fathers Working Group, critical care teams should focus on including and supporting fathers, as well as engaging mothers and fathers as a co-parenting team. Fathers should be actively engaged by pediatric care providers as early as possible, including prenatal visits, through both verbal and nonverbal communication. Efforts should also be made to increase the representation of fathers on hospital family-advisory councils and to engage father stakeholders in hospital quality improvement initiatives to ensure that their perspectives are heard.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>23307</offset><text>A small literature reports on interventions designed to meet the needs of fathers impacted by pediatric illness. Fathers of children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes who received a parent-mentor social support intervention via home visits and phone calls from experienced fathers reported higher confidence in managing diabetes, but also higher levels of worry, as compared to fathers in the control group. The authors hypothesized that this may have been related to an increased awareness of the complexity of diabetes care and potential risks. Another study of fathers of children with type 1 diabetes used surveys and qualitative interviews to develop internet-based education and support resources, including father-specific materials. Future research will evaluate the effectiveness of these resources. Fathers of children in the NICU who were offered a father-specific booklet and nursing support centered on information about care and equipment, tips for direct engagement with their child, and relaxation strategies reported lower levels of stress, higher fathering ability, and higher perceived nursing support compared to those in the control group. To date, interventions targeting the needs of fathers of children with CHD have not been systematically implemented or evaluated.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>24601</offset><text>Racial/ethnic minorities were underrepresented in the study sample and non-English speaking parents were excluded, precluding an understanding of how race, ethnicity, and language may influence sources of stress for fathers of children with CHD. Health inequities can have a powerful influence on parental experiences with pediatric healthcare and parental stress, and their impact on the experiences of fathers specifically should be further explored. This study also focused primarily on the experiences of fathers who were part of a traditional, heterosexual dyadic relationship, and results may not represent the experiences of fathers from diverse family structures, including single parent families, adoptive/blended families, and same-sex couples. The findings from this study may not be generalizable outside of the United States, as all participants lived and received care within the US, and may not fully capture the experiences of fathers who have limited access to or comfort with communication technology. Study results may also have been impacted by self-selection bias, as parents with certain experiences related to stress and support could have been more likely to enroll. Finally, care providers’ perspectives were not assessed but should be evaluated in future studies, as care providers’ beliefs and attitudes can influence interactions with fathers.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>25977</offset><text>Conclusions</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>25989</offset><text>Taken together, study findings highlight the importance of developing models of family-based psychosocial care that consider the needs of fathers and include interventions to meet these needs. Tools to assess stressors and supports of greatest relevance and importance to fathers are needed to identify those at psychosocial risk and inform targeted interventions. However, it is important that care providers also be mindful that not every individual subscribes to traditional gender roles. Targeted interventions to prevent or reduce paternal mental health problems stemming from the demands of caring for children with CHD are likely to result in healthier families and relationships and may improve outcomes for children with CHD.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon

So it was rough trying to be a rock and saying that everything would be ok, even when I had no clue what I was doing…This meant having to go to work and pretend everything was fine while secretly crumbling inside. Father 64	 	Friends, family and caregivers focus more on the mom’s experience than the dad’s…I’ve had a lot of people say things to me like, “Your job is to support her” and “You need to keep up with work”… it overlooks the impact raising a child with CHD has on me as a father. Father 81	 	My husband struggled with/still struggles with the fact that he can not protect our son. Our son is sick and in many ways we are helpless. My husband also has more stress induced negative consequences of CHD than I do, but I think people just do not get that since he is dad. Mother 67	 	Balancing Work and Family Responsibilities	My husband struggled with being away from us for the four months our daughter was inpatient. He had to work, so he came on the weekends. It was harder for him to adjust when we brought her home because he wasn’t living it everyday like I had been for four months. Mother 92	 	It makes me feel like I’m not as good of a parent as [my wife] is because I’m less involved. She also was in the hospital with him non-stop when he was readmitted, whereas I had to go back to work. So I felt very guilty about that. Father 1	 	He worried about money, and being able to care for and support us all. It was hard for him to be at the hospital as much as he would have liked, since he still had to work. And, of course, he had to deal with a stressed out wife.
