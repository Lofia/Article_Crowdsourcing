This method relies on participants’ estimates of other participants’ judgments; when an option is chosen more often than the average metacognitive judgments of that option, it is “surprisingly popular” and is selected by the method. Although SP has been shown to improve group decision making about factual propositions (e.g., state capitals), its application to future outcomes has been limited. In three preregistered studies, we compared SP to other methods of aggregating individual predictions about future events. Study 1 examined predictions of football games, Study 2 examined predictions of the 2018 US midterm elections, and Study 3 examined predictions of basketball games. When applied to judgments made by objectively assessed experts, SP performed slightly better than other aggregation methods. Although there is still more to learn about the conditions under which SP is effective, it shows promise as a means of crowdsourcing predictions of future outcomes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1269</offset><text>Significance statement</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1292</offset><text> When judgments are combined, the result is often more accurate than the individual judgments by themselves—the “wisdom of the crowd” phenomenon. For example, the average estimate (in a classic case, of the weight of an ox) is more accurate than most individual estimates, and the Las Vegas point spread, which is driven by gamblers’ collective decisions, often accurately predicts the winners of games. Sometimes, however, the majority is wrong. For example, most people erroneously believe that Los Angeles, California, is west of Reno, Nevada, and most people incorrectly predicted the 2016 US Presidential election. A recently developed approach, the “surprisingly popular” method, constructs group predictions such that minority opinions can influence the collective choice. When people are correct but in the minority, they often know that many others do not know the correct answer. This knowledge can be leveraged by asking people to make one additional judgment: the percentage of other participants who will make the same judgment they did. Integrating this judgment into the group decision allows the minority choice to sometimes be selected. However, this method has usually been applied to factual judgments, such as knowledge of state capitals, and only rarely has examined prediction of future events. We applied this method to predictions of football games, US elections, and basketball games. We found that the “surprisingly popular” method indeed yielded the most accurate collective predictions, but only when the people making the predictions were knowledgeable about the subject.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>2909</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2922</offset><text>Aggregations of judgments often outperform those of individuals. This phenomenon, often termed “the wisdom of crowds” (Surowiecki), has been shown in many decision and prediction contexts, including mathematical problems (Yi et al.), game shows (Lee et al.), and elections (Gaissmaier and Marewski). However, most crowdsourcing methods have an important limitation—they cannot detect cases in which the majority is wrong.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3350</offset><text>One recently developed aggregation approach, the “surprisingly popular” method (Prelec et al.; henceforth “SP”), has shown promise in overcoming this weakness. The SP method leverages metacognitive awareness: people who are correct, but in the minority, often know that their response is rare. Participants answer one additional question: the percentage of other participants who will make the same judgment they did. These estimates are then compared to participants’ actual judgments. When an option is chosen more often than the average metacognitive judgments of that option, it is “surprisingly popular” and is selected by the method.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4004</offset><text>For example, suppose participants are asked whether Reno, Nevada, is east of Los Angeles, California. Because most of Nevada is east of most of California, people often respond that Reno is east of Los Angeles. This is incorrect; Reno is some 86 miles west of Los Angeles. Suppose that 30% of people know this. They also—importantly—know that this knowledge is rare, and estimate, on average, that 15% of others are also correct. Now consider the 70% of people who are incorrect; suppose that they believe, on average, that 90% of others agree with their answer. Thus, although the average metajudgment was that only 11.5%1 of people believe that Reno is west of Los Angeles, that answer was actually given by 30% of respondents, making it “surprisingly popular.”</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4776</offset><text>Most demonstrations of the SP method have examined judgments in which the correct answer is known. Although improving the accuracy of such judgments may inform understanding of judgments about as-yet-unsolved questions, it does not necessarily follow that improvements in problem solving imply improvements in prediction. Leveraging the SP method to improve prediction of future events is a particularly exciting potential application of this approach.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5229</offset><text>Lee et al. provided the first test of whether the SP method can improve collective judgments of unknown events—that is, future outcomes. Lee et al. had participants predict the winners of National Football League (NFL) games in the 2017 season. They found that, among participants who indicated that they were “extremely knowledgeable” about football, the SP method yielded better predictions than many NFL media figures, an alternative aggregative method (confidence-weighted judgments), and a prominent algorithmic approach to prediction (by fivethirtyeight.com). However, SP was inferior to the democratic method (the modal judgment). Given these mixed results, Lee et al. were appropriately cautious in their conclusions. First, they noted that participants were capable of easily making metacognitive judgments about future events, as they are in the case of factual judgments. Second, they emphasized the importance of expertise in yielding accurate predictions using the SP method. However, several important questions remain unanswered.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6280</offset><text>First, does the SP method actually yield more accurate predictions than other aggregation methods? Examining Lee et al., the most straightforward implication is that SP does not clearly outperform other approaches. Nevertheless, it may be that the particular NFL season examined by Lee et al. is not representative of future events, sporting events, or even NFL seasons. Thus, it remains useful to provide additional tests of the SP method.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6721</offset><text>Second, does the SP method perform better when it aggregates judgments made by experts? Prelec et al. did not find systematic differences in the effectiveness of the SP method based on expertise. In contrast, Lee et al. found that the SP method was more effective when it aggregated only judgments made by self-assessed experts. However, this selection decision was exploratory (Lee et al., p. 326), and moreover, self-assessments of expertise are not always accurate (Kruger and Dunning).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7211</offset><text>To examine these questions, we conducted three studies in which participants predicted future outcomes. We compared the SP method to other methods of aggregating crowdsourced judgments and also assessed expertise by testing domain knowledge. Study 1 examined predictions of NFL games made by students, Study 2 examined predictions of the 2018 midterm elections made by mTurk workers, and Study 3 examined predictions of NBA games made by members of the /r/NBA and /r/sportsbook subreddits and students in a sport psychology course. We hypothesized that the SP method, when applied to judgments made by experts, would yield more accurate forecasts than other crowdsourcing approaches.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>7895</offset><text>Study 1</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7903</offset><text>In Study 1, we replicated Lee et al., with two important refinements.

First, the democratic method selects the team who was predicted to win by the most participants. Continuing the example discussed previously, because 70% of people believed that Reno is east of Los Angeles, the democratic method would select this (incorrect) response. Second, the confidence-weighted method multiplied each prediction by its associated confidence and selected the team with the highest weighted prediction count. Suppose that, in the Reno/Los Angeles example, the 30% of people correctly responding that Reno was west of Los Angeles had a mean confidence of 4.5 in their choice, whereas the remaining 70% had a mean confidence of 3.5. Here, the confidence-weighted method would select the incorrect response.2 Last, the surprisingly popular (SP) method, described previously, identified the option chosen more often by participants than it was estimated to be chosen. When a method resulted in a tie, 0.5 correct predictions were awarded.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10864</offset><text>In addition to the aggregation approaches, the predictions made by members of the media (as recorded by nflpickwatch.com) were recorded.

This finding is somewhat consistent with Study 1, in that all three methods performed similarly, although here all aggregative methods performed much better than individual forecasts. As shown in Fig. 3, there was considerable overlap among the methods’ predictions, with fivethirtyeight.com again diverging notably from the crowdsourced models.

Although the SP method has been effectively applied to aggregate the judgments of non-experts (Prelec et al.), the judgments in those studies applied to questions with known answers, such as state capitals. It may be that expertise matters more in instances of “true” prediction of as-yet-unknown outcomes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>24822</offset><text>Because the SP method relies on metacognition—participants’ ability to both make predictions and know whether those predictions are shared—it should be particularly effective when used to aggregate the judgments of experts, whose knowledge and, presumably, domain-specific metaknowledge is superior (MacIntyre et al.). This hypothesis was supported. In Study 1, the SP method was most effective when applied to objectively assessed experts. In Study 2, using the SP method to aggregate the predictions of objectively assessed experts yielded the most accurate predictions of any crowdsourced approach. In Study 3, which examined a sample of experts, the SP method also yielded the most accurate predictions. Generally, then, it seems that—at least when expertise is assessed objectively—the SP method was more effective when applied to expert participants. This is consistent with extant work examining aggregation of expert judgments (c.f. Mannes et al.). However, it should be noted that only in Studies 2 and 3 did aggregative methods (in general) decisively outperform individual judgments.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>25927</offset><text>Although the SP method performed ordinally better than other methods when aggregating expert judgments, the differences between methods were small. However, small differences in predictive accuracy can still be consequential. To concretize this, consider the 2019 Westgate SuperContest, in which contestants paid a $10,000 entry fee and picked five NFL games each week against the spread. The average accuracy of the participants who predicted all games was 50.4%. The top 100 of the 3123 entrants won cash prizes; the average accuracy of these entrants was 61.7%. Or, considering another metric, suppose $100 was wagered on each of the contests in all three studies, using each method; assuming a − 110 vigorish on all bets, betting on the outcome chosen by the surprisingly popular aggregation of objectively assessed experts would have yielded $2300 more profit than the next-highest method.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>26826</offset><text>The current studies had several limitations. First, participants in Studies 1 and 2 may not have been strongly motivated to be accurate, as there were no incentives for correct predictions or accurate judgments of others’ predictions. Second, it is unclear how challenging the knowledge questionnaires were, and so gauging participants’ expertise is difficult. It seems clear that objectively assessed experts within each sample were more knowledgeable than the rest of those samples, and that participants in Study 3 were more knowledgeable about basketball than were the populations from which the participants in Studies 1 and 2 were drawn, but absolute levels of knowledge are unknown. Third, we deviated from our preregistered plan in Study 3 to respond to recruitment challenges and because of the sample’s expertise. Study 3, then, should be considered somewhat exploratory.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>27714</offset><text>Conclusion</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27725</offset><text>We tested whether the “surprisingly popular” method could crowdsource accurate predictions of future outcomes.
