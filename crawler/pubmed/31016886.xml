Interindividual variability was previously characterized by an American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics crowdsourced study. To further characterize urinary odor kinetics, we conducted a study with consenting participants from Takeda Pharmaceutical International Company. The participants were randomized to consume a specified number of asparagus spears and asked to record urine odor. A kinetic‐pharmacodynamic model characterized the data from both the newly conducted Takeda study (N = 42) and the previously analyzed American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics studies (total N = 139). The updated model included the identification of an absorption process with a half‐life of 25 minutes. We estimated the elimination half‐life of the asparagus effect on malodorous urine to be 7.2 hours, which was 44% longer in our study. We built on previous experience using an improved R‐Shiny app for conducting the crowdsourcing experiment, further demonstrating the utility of this population kinetics approach in organizational and educational settings.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_caption</infon><offset>1258</offset><text>Study Highlights</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1275</offset><text> WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC? </text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1321</offset><text>  Perceived urinary odor kinetics interindividual variability after the consumption of asparagus spears were previously characterized by an American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics crowdsourced study.

The published crowdsourcing study also provided an opportunity to reemphasize the “Learn and Confirm” paradigm,2 which influenced our operational and scientific objectives. Consequently, the lessons learned from the previous study1 were used to alter selected design and operational aspects of our study. There was a need to redesign the data collection process by developing a web‐based application for topics related to the overall management of the study, from randomization to data recording and real‐time data exploration. In addition, our scientific “Learn and Confirm” objective was to use the ASCPT study to not only further model refinement but also to allow for a comparison between the two populations and potentially identify any new sources of interindividual variability that would enhance our understanding.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4376</offset><text>To maximize the number of participants, we chose a face‐to‐face Takeda Translational Research and Early Clinical (TREC) Functional Meeting as the ideal venue to reach out to and engage with all participants as well as provide them with the opportunity to engage in a fun exercise for the operational part of the trial.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4699</offset><text>The anecdotal health benefits of asparagus are frequently discussed in health and nutritional magazines, although not all evidence points to such benefits.3 The phenomenon of odorous urine following asparagus ingestion is not familiar to everyone because a fraction of the population do not produce odorous urine and/or cannot smell it.

Although it is difficult to characterize precisely which molecules are malodorous, methanethiol or methyl–mercaptan are the most predominant.7 In contrast to the metabolizing enzymes potentially involved in the production and disposition of the odorous metabolites, more information has recently become available with respect to the olfactory genes that may be associated with anosmia.8 Indeed, a recently reported genome‐wide associated study involving 6,909 individuals reported that 871 single‐nucleotide polymorphisms reached genome‐wide significance for asparagus anosmia, highlighting that the ability to smell the metabolites of asparagus consumption varies among people and across populations.8 Although the sources of variability in the production and perception of asparagus odorous metabolites are scientifically intriguing, they have been discussed in detail elsewhere4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and will therefore not be discussed further here.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6382</offset><text>To execute the current study within the timeframe of the meeting (and a data collection period of 72 hours postingestion of asparagus), we decided to use the protocol from the original study at the ASCPT meeting1 but with some minor adaptations.

From a scientific perspective, we successfully developed a kinetic‐pharmacodynamic model to characterize data from both the newly conducted TREC study and the previously analyzed ASCPT studies. Our final model was an extension of the previously developed ASCPT model, with the following two major updates: (i) identification of an absorption process to further characterize the (unobserved) asparagus exposure and (ii) estimation of a different half‐life for participants in the TREC study. The exposure half‐life was predicted to be 44% longer in the TREC study when compared with the ASCPT studies. The absorption half‐life was approximately 25 minutes, indicating a short time frame between the consumption of asparagus and the detection of odor in the urine. The new model adequately predicted odor score levels up to grade 4 (strong) in both the TREC study as well as the ASCPT studies. Consistent with the findings from the ASCPT study, our study demonstrated that the number of asparagus spears consumed related very well with the strength of odor, as depicted in Figure   5 . The longer half‐life of the odor observed in our study is likely the result of the timing of the study. The TREC study was conducted at lunch time, whereas the ASCPT study was performed later in the day. We speculate that in addition to the timing of the study, a thorough overview of the study objectives and operational procedures and greater compliance in recording of odor scores may have also contributed to the quality of the data collected. Although findings from the ASCPT study were consistent with the assumption that renal function decreases with age, we were more limited in demographic spread to allow for further evaluation on any potential differences in intrinsic and extrinsic factors that may have influenced the half‐life.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28233</offset><text>We recorded only one participant who did not perceive odorous urine after consuming asparagus, a finding in contrast with that observed in previous studies.1, 4, 9 Furthermore, when compared with the ASCPT study, our study was more restricted in terms of age range, thereby limiting the opportunity to explore the complete effect of age on renal excretion.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28590</offset><text>From an operational perspective, although we were fortunate that the ASCPT study team shared their previous experience with us, we still invested a significant amount of time in building the multifunctional Shiny app that included all the necessary domains required for the successful execution of the study and automatic data collection. However, we still faced some challenges with respect to data cleaning, which were raised by email and resolved. Nevertheless, the multifunctional app proved to be a worthwhile investment in terms of both time and effort as it was efficient and removed a substantial burden from the trial team enabling them to execute the study within 1 day. We also observed a very high compliance rate in our study with only two missing observations. We speculate that there were several reasons for this, namely curiosity, social aspects, raised awareness around the crowdsourcing study, and finally the functionality of the mobile Shiny app. We also observed that anecdotes around asparagus consumption and its potential health benefits further stimulated interaction and discussion. Notably, all participants were invited to a presentation of the final study results. We observed that they were all very curious to see these results and actively engaged in discussions around the study findings following completion of the analysis. Overall, this entire exercise generated a very positive and collaborative atmosphere.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>30037</offset><text>Finally, because we were inspired by the ASCPT study, we wanted to share our experiences and pass the baton onto the community so that others may also attempt this exercise in their organizations or educational institutions.

As we pass on this knowledge to the next study cohort, we would also like to share not only our experience and learning, but also the R‐Shiny app code that was used to create the app, in the hope that this will be used and further improved in the future.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ACK_FUND</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>30782</offset><text>Funding</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ACK_FUND</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>30790</offset><text>Takeda Pharmaceuticals International Co. sponsored and funded the study.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">COMP_INT</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>30863</offset><text>Conflict of Interest</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">COMP_INT</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>30884</offset><text>The study was sponsored by and executed at Takeda Pharmaceuticals International Co., Cambridge, MA.
