Due to the employed carrying platforms (which are often cars), existing measuring methods can only be used for motorable roads. Until now, there has been no effective method for measuring the surface roughness of un-motorable roads, such as pedestrian and bicycle lanes. This hinders many applications related to pedestrians, cyclists and wheelchair users. In recognizing these research gaps, this paper proposes a method for measuring the surface roughness of pedestrian and bicycle lanes based on Global Positioning System (GPS) and accelerometer sensors on bicycle-mounted smartphones. We focus on the International Roughness Index (IRI), as it is the most widely used index for measuring road surface roughness. Specifically, we analyzed a computing model of road surface roughness, derived its parameters with GPS and accelerometers on bicycle-mounted smartphones, and proposed an algorithm to recognize potholes/humps on roads. As a proof of concept, we implemented the proposed method in a mobile application. Three experiments were designed to evaluate the proposed method. The results of the experiments show that the IRI values measured by the proposed method were strongly and positively correlated with those measured by professional instruments. Meanwhile, the proposed algorithm was able to recognize the potholes/humps that the bicycle passed. The proposed method is useful for measuring the surface roughness of roads that are not accessible for professional instruments, such as pedestrian and cycle lanes. This work enables us to further study the feasibility of crowdsourcing road surface roughness with bicycle-mounted smartphones.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1838</offset><text>1. Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1854</offset><text>The surface roughness of roads is an important road characteristic, and it is closely related to driving safety, passenger comfort, road maintenance and so on. With the increase of road mileage all over the world, the quality of roads has become an important concern. Among different road quality indicators, road roughness is probably one of the most important ones. No matter which mode of transportation users take, bumpy roads will significantly increase the difficulty of travel and the potholes/humps of a road will even hinder the progress of vehicles and road users. Moreover, bumpy roads significantly reduce the lifespan of the roads themselves. Therefore, recently, lots of research interest has been centered on developing methods for collecting information regarding pavement.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2644</offset><text>While existing measuring methods, such as vehicle-mounted 3D LiDAR measuring systems, can provide very accurate information on road surface roughness, they are often very expensive and restricted to professional applications. There are also several studies that have used low-cost accelerometers and other sensors available on smartphones to measure road surface roughness, mainly using cars as the carrying platforms. However, due to the employed vehicles, these systems can only be used on motorable roads. Until now, there has been no effective method of measuring the road surface roughness of pedestrian and bicycle lanes, which hinders many potential applications related to pedestrians, wheelchair users and cyclists, such as navigation and routing.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3401</offset><text>At present, smartphones are integrating more and more sensors (e.g., Global Positioning System (GPS) and accelerometers). These sensors can potentially provide some necessary data to estimate road surface roughness. For example, the most commonly used measure of road surface roughness is the International Roughness Index (IRI). To compute IRI values, the accumulative vertical displacement value (resulting from potholes and humps on the road) and the overall travel distance are needed. The accumulative vertical displacement value can be derived using accelerometer sensors, while the overall travel distance can be obtained using GPS sensors. These two kinds of sensors are available in most of the current smartphones. This makes smartphones promising devices for measuring road surface roughness. Meanwhile, due to their rather rigid structure, bicycles are often very sensitive to the ups and downs of roads. Mounting smartphones on bicycles would potentially allow users to map road surface roughness when they travel around, especially on bicycle and pedestrian lanes. This will become a more promising option as cycling in cities becomes more and more popular, which will potentially allow large-scale crowdsourcing of road surface roughness, similar to the famous volunteered geographic information (VGI) project OpenStreetMap ().</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4744</offset><text>In recognizing the research gaps and the high potential of smartphones, this paper aims to propose a method for measuring the road surface roughness of bicycle and pedestrian lanes based on GPS and accelerometer sensors on bicycle-mounted smartphones. We mainly focus on IRI. Firstly, we analyzed the computing model of road surface roughness and derived the parameters of the IRI model with a bicycle-mounted GPS and accelerometer on a smartphone. An algorithm was then proposed to identify potholes and humps on roads. As a proof of concept, an iOS mobile application “RoadSR” was developed based on the proposed method. Furthermore, three experiments were designed to evaluate the proposed method. We demonstrate that the IRI values measured by the proposed method strongly and positively correlate with those measured by professional instruments.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5599</offset><text>The rest of this article is organized as follows: Section 2 presents related work.

Road Surface Roughness: Definitions and Evaluation Metrics</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5955</offset><text>Road surface roughness can be understood as an expression of the deviation of the road surface from a true planar surface. It is an important road characteristic because it affects not only riding quality, but also safety, road service life, fuel consumption and maintenance costs. It is often used interchangeably with smoothness. Road surface roughness cannot be measured directly; it requires calculations and deductions based on measurements.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6402</offset><text>The statistical analysis of road roughness began in the fifties in the twentieth century. In approximately 1950, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) conducted a subjective evaluation of road roughness. In 1966, Elson Spangler and William Kelly from General Electric developed a first objective measurement method using a longitudinal inertial measuring instrument. The underlying theory behind this method is still in use today.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6875</offset><text>Different evaluation metrics have been proposed to indicate or report road surface roughness, such as the International Roughness Index (IRI), Present Serviceability Rating (PSR), Root Mean Square Vertical Acceleration (RMSVA), Mean Panel Rating (MPR), Ride Number (RN), Slope Variance (SV), and Profile Index (PI). Among them, IRI, which was developed by the World Bank in the 1980s, is currently the most widely used indicator of road surface roughness, because it can be transformed to other metrics. It is computed using “a mathematical model known as the ‘quarter-car model’, which represents the way a single tire system (a quarter of a car) is affected by the profile of the pavement [/road]”. The commonly recommended units are meters per kilometer (m/km) or millimeters per meter (mm/m). Based on IRI measurements, several other indices have been proposed, such as the Mean Ride Index (MRI) and the Half-Car Ride Index (HRI), which have no essential differences to IRI. In this research, we used the IRI to represent road surface roughness.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>7933</offset><text>2.2. Measurement Methods of Road Surface Roughness</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7984</offset><text>A number of different professional methods and devices have been used over the years for measuring road surface roughness, including Rod and Level, Straight Edge, Profilograph, Response-Type Instruments, Walking Profilers, and Inertial Profilers. Inertial Profilers are the most sophisticated roadway profiling system currently available. A typical example in regard to this aspect is the vehicle-mounted laser cross section measuring system (Figure 1), which uses a laser scanner and accelerometer to record the longitudinal displacement, and a horizontal displacement recorder to measure the distance travelled. These kinds of systems provide a relatively accurate and repeatable simulation of the road profile, which can then be analyzed to produce various roughness statistics, including the IRI. These systems are often very expensive and restricted to professional applications in highway engineering. More importantly, due to the employed vehicles, these systems can only be used on motorable roads, and are not suitable for measuring the surface roughness of other roads, such as cycle lanes and pedestrian lanes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9106</offset><text>With the rapid development in mobile sensor technology, the cost of accelerometers and other measurement sensors (e.g., GPS) is getting lower and lower.

Therefore, recent research interest has been directed toward using these low-cost accelerometers and other sensors to measure road surface roughness. In the following section, we review these studies.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9577</offset><text>Most of the existing studies related to this aspect used cars as a carrying platform.

(2008) added a GPS device to Gonzalez et al.’s solution to record trajectories and locate potholes. Mednis et al. (2010) further added a microphone to identify potholes from the sound signal. Vittorio Astarita and colleagues assessed road surface quality based on GPS and accelerometer data on smartphones placed on cars. Several recent studies also used cars as a carrying platform. Some of them further investigated the relationships between sensor output and the roughness index, while the others proposed algorithms for pothole recognition. Li and Goldberg (2018) proposed a mobile crowdsensing system for road surface assessment based on GPS and accelerometer data from smartphones placed on cars. Alessandroni et al. (2017) further investigated the influence of speed on road roughness sensing using smartphones on cars. Different from the above studies, Tai et al. (2010) used a motorcycle as a carrying tool, and used the smartphone’s accelerometer and GPS sensor to detect road damage location information. Chang et al. (2009) used automatic robots with GPS equipment to estimate road roughness.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10942</offset><text>Due to the fact that IRI and other metrics of road surface roughness cannot be measured directly, a computational model is needed to convert sensor output (e.g., acceleration data from accelerometer sensors) to these metrics.

Computational Model of Road Surface Roughness: IRI</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>12629</offset><text>Road surface roughness does not have a unified general definition. Normally, computation of road surface roughness includes three steps: (1) data acquisition; (2) pre-processing; and (3) calculation. This paper chose the IRI as the evaluating indicator of road surface roughness. IRI is calculated from a measured longitudinal road profile by accumulating the output from a quarter-car model and dividing by the profile length to yield a summary roughness index with units of slope.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>13112</offset><text>For example, for a vehicle driving on a road like that shown in Figure 2,  is the sampling time, and hi is the longitudinal offset of the road surface at .

Several parameters are included when computing the road vertical displacement (Vh): the mass of the vehicle body (m1), the mass of wheel and suspension (m2), the elastic coefficient of the spring (K1), the elastic coefficient of the tire (K2), the damping coefficient of the suspension (C), and two body vertical displacements (x1 and x2). However, in the common bicycle structure, the frame’s and the wheel’s elastic capacities are very limited. Therefore, in the bicycle model (Figure 3b), the bicycle can be regarded as a rigid structure, so K1, C and K2 can be ignored; the model parameters are reduced to m and x. We assumed that the rider keeps the bicycle posture as stable as possible. In other words, he/she tries to avoid making the bicycle swing. To further reduce the impact of potential small swings, we used high-pass filter to clean the sensor data when we computed IRI (see Section 3.2.2 for more details). In the rigid structure, there is no spring shock effect and the bicycle body’s vertical displacement only makes contact with the tire–road surface, and therefore, x is equal to Vh.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>15260</offset><text>Another important thing that needs to be considered is the installation position of smartphones on bicycles. When the smartphone is fixed to different parts of a bicycle, different acceleration data might be recorded by the smartphone. Among all other places, the center of the handlebar seems to be a typical place for fixing smartphones on bicycles, according to cycling web platforms, like Cycling Weekly () and ChinaBike (). Therefore, in the current study, we fixed the smartphones to the center of the handlebar, as can be seen in Figure 4.

Their values can be derived from sensors on bicycle-mounted smartphones. For example, the travel distance (S) can be computed using data recorded by GPS sensors on smartphones, and  can be obtained from accelerometer sensors. These two kinds of sensors are available in most of the current smartphones. GPS sensors on smartphones can return the current location (longitude/latitude) as well as information like travel speed. Accelerometers on current smartphones are often tri-axial, and provide acceleration information on three axes (x, y, and z) in the unit of g. In the following, we show how these data can be used to compute IRI, as specified in Equation (5).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_3</infon><offset>17190</offset><text>3.2.1.

However, the altitude accuracy of GPS sensors is often very poor, and their sampling frequency is often rather low (typically 1 Hz). Therefore, using altitude data provided by GPS for calculating vertical displacement is problematic. In this paper, we used vertical acceleration provided by accelerometers on smartphones, which allows a much higher sampling rate. As the installation of the smartphone on the bicycle as well as the orientation of the smartphone are unknown and variable, the vertical acceleration () may appear in either dimension of the tri-axial acceleration data returned by the accelerometer. In other words, the z-axis acceleration data from the accelerometer cannot be taken directly as the vertical acceleration ().

The application finally visualizes the IRI values computed and the potholes and humps are identified on a map, using AutoNavi map SDK.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>26295</offset><text>To use “RoadSR”, the rider only needs to fix the smartphone onto the bicycle, click the “Start” button on the bottom left of the application interface, and data about the road surface roughness will be automatically collected using GPS and accelerometer sensors (Figure 6a). The rider can click the “Finish” button on the bottom right to stop recording. When the recording is stopped, the application automatically calculates the IRI values of the road just traveled and identifies potholes/humps (Figure 6c). The rider can then view the results on a map view.

We selected 10 road sections in Banqiao Town, southwest of Nanjing, China (Figure 7). These 10 road sections differed in pavement materials and conditions, road widths and lengths. We used the car mounted laser pavement scanner (see Figure 1) from the Nanjing Highway Scientific Research Institute, which is a professional instrument and system for measuring IRI values on motorable roads. For each road section, we first drove the car, followed by the bicycle. When riding the bicycle, we tried to keep the speed and the bicycle posture as stable as possible. At the end of the collection, we computed the IRI values of each road section, taking 20 m as the computing unit.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27933</offset><text>A Pearson correlation coefficient was computed to assess the relationship between the IRI values measured by the car with the laser scanner to those measured by our proposed method.

Experiment 3: Recognition of Potholes and Humps on Roads</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>30666</offset><text>This experiment aimed to evaluate the performance of the potholes/humps recognition algorithm proposed in Section 3.3. We chose seven road sections with different types of potholes and humps (Figure 11). The potholes and humps differed in type and longitudinal offset. We started the application and rode on these road sections. In order to record the actual riding tracking and the potholes/humps that the bicycle passed through, we used a tracking camera mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to capture the image data at the moment that the bicycle passed a pothole/hump.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>31247</offset><text>We compared the potholes/humps recognized by the proposed algorithm with the ground truth obtained from the UAV image data. The results of the experiment show that the proposed algorithm was able to correctly recognize all of the potholes/humps (and their locations) that the bicycle passed (see Figure 12 for an example), except for the crack in the third road section (Figure 13). Having a closer look at the crack, we found that it is rather small, and its longitudinal offer is about −0.7 cm, which is the main reason why the proposed algorithm failed to detect this crack. This raises an interesting question regarding what can be considered as a pothole or hump, or more precisely, a pothole or hump that influences peoples’ travel experiences. More research should be done on this aspect.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>32047</offset><text>5. Discussion</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>32061</offset><text>As shown in the above section, “Implementation and Evaluation”, the proposed method is feasible for measuring road surface roughness and identifying potholes/humps on roads, using data recorded by GPS and accelerometer sensors on bicycle-mounted smartphones. The three experiments illustrated that the IRI values measured by the proposed method strongly and positively correlate with those measured by professional instruments. Meanwhile, the proposed algorithm was able to recognize the potholes/humps (and their locations) that a bicycle passed. The proposed method is very useful for measuring surface roughness of roads that are not accessible for professional instruments (which are often installed on motor vehicles), such as pedestrian lanes and cycle lanes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>32831</offset><text>When measuring the road surface roughness using the proposed method, we asked bicycle riders to keep the speed and the bicycle posture as stable as possible, and to not deliberately pass through or avoid bump areas on the roads. This might not be very realistic for real-world settings, as users might change their posture during riding. Changing the bicycle posture will influence the acceleration signals of the accelerometer sensor, and thus have a negative impact on the measurement results. Methods regarding signal processing and noise removal might help to address this issue. We will address this in our follow-up studies.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>33462</offset><text>In this study, we fixed smartphones on the center of the bicycle handlebar. While this is a typical place where cyclists fix their smartphones, it might be interesting to investigate whether different installation positions on the bicycle lead to different measurement results. To comprehensively address this issue, the installation position of the smartphone should be considered together with the length of the wheelbase of the bicycle. In some extreme cases, the accelerometer sensor on the smartphone might be only subjected to angular acceleration. Therefore, it makes sense to investigate this issue in detail, and identify an optional installation position based on the length of a wheelbase.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>34163</offset><text>In Experiment 1, we compared the IRI values measured by a professional vehicle and those by our proposed bicycle-mounted smartphone-based method. It is important to note that the vehicle travelled in the center of the roads, while for security reasons, the bicycles only used the side of the road. Therefore, the travel trajectories do not completely match. This obviously led to some differences in the IRI values they computed. To further improve this experiment, one could use the bicycle on the other side of the roads that the vehicle traveled, and check whether the average IRI values match those from the professional vehicle.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>34797</offset><text>Experiment 2 showed that different bicycles (i.e., mountain bicycle and city bicycle) lead to slight differences in the IRI values measured. This might be due to the different elasticity coefficients of the bicycles and their wheels/tires. Further studies should be done to investigate this aspect further. Meanwhile, it would also be interesting to see whether different riding styles lead to different measurement results.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>35222</offset><text>The proposed algorithm for identifying potholes/humps currently uses a fixed acceleration threshold () (we set it as 2 g for the experiments) to identify sparks in the signal data.

As shown in the experiments, the proposed bicycle-mounted smartphone-based method can be used to map the road surface roughness and identify potholes/humps on roads. Currently, cycling in cities is becoming more and more popular. Therefore, potentially a huge number of contributors are available to map the road surface roughness around the areas they travel, using their own smartphones. This would be a nice add-on to the VGI project, OpenStreetMap. Having this kind of information available would allow many interesting and innovative applications, such as navigation and routing for pedestrian, bicycles and wheelchairs.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>36269</offset><text>6. Conclusions and Future Work</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>36300</offset><text>Recent years have seen increasing interest in mapping the surface roughness of roads, as it is closely related to driving safety, passenger comfort, road maintenance and so on. While several professional systems, such as vehicle-mounted laser scanning, exist, they can only be used for motorable roads. Until now, there has been no effective method for measuring the road surface roughness of pedestrian and bicycle lanes. This article proposed a method for measuring the road surface roughness of pedestrian and bicycle lanes based on GPS and accelerometer sensors on bicycle-mounted smartphones. We mainly focused on the IRI metric.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>36935</offset><text>A proof-of-concept and three experiments were designed to evaluate the proposed method. Results of the implementation and the experiments showed that the IRI values measured by the proposed method strongly and positively correlate with those measured by professional instruments, and the proposed method was able to recognize potholes and humps (and their locations) passed by the bicycles.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>37326</offset><text>In conclusion, bicycle-mounted smartphones can be used to measure the surface roughness of roads as well as to identify potholes and humps along the roads. This approach is especially useful for those roads that are not accessible by professional instruments (which are often installed on motor vehicles like cars), such as pedestrian lanes and cycle lanes. This work enables us to further study the feasibility of large-scale crowdsourcing of road surface roughness (like OpenStreetMap) with bicycle-mounted smartphones, as cycling has become more and more popular in recent years.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>37909</offset><text>As a next step, we will further improve the proposed method by considering different bike-riding styles, travel speeds, bicycle models, smartphone installation positions, and road conditions (e.g., uphill and downhill). In the meantime, we would like to develop a self-adaptive algorithm to identify potholes and humps on the roads. Furthermore, as mentioned previously, we would like to expand this work towards large-scale crowdsourcing of road surface roughness. To achieve this aim, we plan to implement a web platform allowing cyclists to upload their recorded GPS and accelerometer data, as well as provide some other information, like bike type and relevant parameters (e.g., length of wheelbase), and installation position of smartphones. The IRI values will then be derived, stored, and visualized in a map view. Algorithms will then be developed to combine results from different cyclists for the same road segment. These IRI values can be also integrated to enrich the VGI project, OpenStreetMap, with surface roughness information on pedestrian and cycle lanes. This will allow many interesting applications, such as navigation and routing for bicycles, pedestrian, and wheelchairs, and road maintenance.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">AUTH_CONT</infon><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>39126</offset><text>Author Contributions</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">AUTH_CONT</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>39147</offset><text>K.Z., J.Shen, H.H., M.W. conceived and designed the study; J.Shen organized the overall research; H.H. developed the recognition algorithm; M.W. developed the “RoadSR” mobile application; K.Z. and M.W. performed the experiment and analyzed the data; all authors wrote the paper.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">COMP_INT</infon><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>39430</offset><text>Conflicts of Interest</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">COMP_INT</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>39452</offset><text>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>39497</offset><text>References</text></passage><passage><infon key="name_0">surname:Smith;given-names:K.</infon><infon key="name_1">surname:Ram;given-names:P.</infon><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="source">Measures and Specifying Pavement Smoothness</infon><infon key="type">ref</infon><infon key="year">2016</infon><offset>39508</offset></passage><passage><infon key="fpage">6</infon><infon key="lpage">13</infon><infon key="name_0">surname:Chang;given-names:C.L.</infon><infon key="name_1">surname:He;given-names:S.</infon><infon key="name_2">surname:Qian;given-names:J.Z.</infon><infon key="name_3">surname:Mao;given-names:L.J.</infon><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="source">J.
