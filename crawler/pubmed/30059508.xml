Therefore, in many cases, producing good ground truth data typically involves trained professionals; however, this can be costly in time, effort, and money. Here we explore the use of crowdsourcing to generate a large number of training data of good quality. We explore an image analysis task involving the segmentation of corn tassels from images taken in a field setting. We investigate the accuracy, speed and other quality metrics when this task is performed by students for academic credit, Amazon MTurk workers, and Master Amazon MTurk workers. We conclude that the Amazon MTurk and Master Mturk workers perform significantly better than the for-credit students, but with no significant difference between the two MTurk worker types. Furthermore, the quality of the segmentation produced by Amazon MTurk workers rivals that of an expert worker. We provide best practices to assess the quality of ground truth data, and to compare data quality produced by different sources. We conclude that properly managed crowdsourcing can be used to establish large volumes of viable ground truth data at a low cost and high quality, especially in the context of high throughput plant phenotyping. We also provide several metrics for assessing the quality of the generated datasets.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon><infon key="type">abstract_title_1</infon><offset>1469</offset><text>Author summary</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>1484</offset><text>Food security is a growing global concern. Farmers, plant breeders, and geneticists are hastening to address the challenges presented to agriculture by climate change, dwindling arable land, and population growth. Scientists in the field of plant phenomics are using satellite and drone images to understand how crops respond to a changing environment and to combine genetics and environmental measures to maximize crop growth efficiency. However, the terabytes of image data require new computational methods to extract useful information. Machine learning algorithms are effective in recognizing select parts of images, but they require high quality data curated by people to train them, a process that can be laborious and costly. We examined how well crowdsourcing works in providing training data for plant phenomics, specifically, segmenting a corn tassel—the male flower of the corn plant—from the often-cluttered images of a cornfield. We provided images to students, and to Amazon MTurkers, the latter being an on-demand workforce brokered by Amazon.com and paid on a task-by-task basis. We report on best practices in crowdsourcing image labeling for phenomics, and compare the different groups on measures such as fatigue and accuracy over time. We find that crowdsourcing is a good way of generating quality labeled data, rivaling that of experts.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2848</offset><text>This is a PLOS Computational Biology Methods paper.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>2900</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2913</offset><text>Crop genetics include basic research (what does this gene do?) and efforts to effect agricultural improvement (can I improve this trait?). Geneticists are primarily concerned with the former and plant breeders are concerned with the latter. A major difference in the perspectives between these groups is their interest in learning which genes underlie a trait of interest: whereas geneticists are generally interested in what genes do, breeders can treat the underlying genetics as opaque, selecting for useful traits by tracking molecular markers, or directly, via phenotypic selection.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3501</offset><text>Historically, the connections between plant genotype and phenotype were investigated through forward genetics approaches, which involve identifying a trait of interest, then carrying out experiments to identify which gene is responsible for that trait. With the advent of convenient mutagens, molecular genetics, bioinformatics, and high-performance computing, researchers were able to associate genotypes with phenotypes more easily via a reverse genetics approach: mutate genes, sequence them, then look for an associated phenotype.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4036</offset><text>However, the pursuit of forward genetics approaches is back on the table, given the even more recent availability of inexpensive image data collection and storage coupled with computational image processing and analysis. In addition, the potential for breeders to computationally analyze phenotypes is enabled, thus allowing for the scope and scale of breeding gains to be driven by computational power. While high-throughput collection of forward genetic data is now feasible, we must now enable the analysis of phenotypic data in a high-throughput way. The first step in such analysis is to identify regions of interest as well as quantitative phenotypic traits from the images collected. Tang et al. described a model to extract tassel out of one single corn plant photo through color segmentation. However, when images are taken under field conditions, classifying images using the same processing algorithm can yield sub-optimal results. Changes in illumination, perspective, or shading, as well as occlusion, debris, precipitation, and vibration of the imaging equipment can all result in large fluctuations in image quality and information content. Machine learning (ML) methods have shown exceptional promise in extracting information from such noisy and unstructured image data. Kurtulmuş and Kavdir adopted a machine learning classifier, support vector machine (SVM), to identify tassel regions based on the binarization of color images. An increasing number of methods from the field of computer vision are recruited to extract phenotypic traits from field data. For example, fine-grained algorithms have been developed to not only identify tassel regions, but also identify tassel traits such as total tassel number, tassel length, width, etc. </text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5794</offset><text>A necessary requirement for training ML models is the availability of labeled data. Labeled data consist of a large set of representative images with the desired features labeled or highlighted. A large and accurate labeled data set, the ground truth, is required for training the algorithm. The focus of this project is the identification of corn tassels, in images acquired in the field. For this task, the labeling process includes defining a minimum rectangular bounding box around the tassel. While seemingly simple, drawing a bounding box does requires effort to ensure accuracy, and a good deal of time to generate a sufficiently large training set. Preparing such a dataset by a single user can be laborious and time consuming. To ensure accuracy, such a generated set should ideally be proofed by several people, adding more time, labor, and expense to the task.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6666</offset><text>One solution to the problem is to take a large cohort of untrained individuals to perform the task, and to compile and extract some plurality or majority of their answers as a training set. This approach, also known as crowdsourcing, has been used successfully many times to provide image-based information in diverse fields including astronomy, zoology, computational chemistry, and biomedicine, among others.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7077</offset><text>Crop genetics research has a long history of “low-tech” crowdsourcing. Groups of student workers are sent into fields to identify phenotypes of interest, with the rates of success often a single instance among thousands of plants. Students in the social sciences also regularly participate in experiments to learn about the research process and gain first-hand experience acting as participants. To manage these large university participant pools, cloud based software, such as the Sona system (www.sona-systems.com), are routinely used to schedule experiment appointments and to link to web-based research materials before automatically granting credit to participants. University participant pools provide a unique opportunity for crowdsourcing on a minimal budget because participants are compensated with course credit rather than money.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7923</offset><text>More recently, crowdsourcing has been available via commercial platforms, such as the Amazon Mechanical Turk, or MTurk, platform(https://www.mturk.com/). MTurk is a popular venue for crowdsourcing due to the large number of available workers and the relative ease with which tasks can be uploaded and payments disbursed. Methods for crowdsourcing and estimates of data quality have been available for years, and several recommendations have emerged from past work. For example, collecting multiple responses per image can account for natural variation and the relative skill of the untrained workers. Furthermore, a majority vote of MTurk workers can label images with similar accuracy to that of experts. Although those studies were limited to labeling categorical features of stock images, other studies have shown success with more complex stimuli. For example, MTurk workers were able to diagnose disease and identify the clinically relevant areas in images of human retinas with accuracy approaching that of medical experts. Amazon’s MTurk is a particularly valuable tool for researchers because it provides incentives for high quality work. The offering party has the ability to restrict their task to only workers with a particular work history, or a more general criterion known as ‘Master Turk’ status. The Master title is a status given to workers by Amazon based on a set of criteria that Amazon believes to represent the overall quality of the worker; note that Amazon does not disclose those criteria.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9444</offset><text>The time and cost savings of using crowdsourcing to label data are obvious, but crowdsourcing is only a viable solution if the output is sufficiently accurate. The goal of the current project was to test whether crowdsourcing image labels (also called tags) could yield a sufficient positive-data training set for ML from image-based phenotypes in as little as a single day. We focus on corn tassels for this effort but we anticipate our findings to extend to other similar tasks in plant phenotyping.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9946</offset><text>In this project, we recruited three groups of people for our crowdsourcing tassel identification task, from the two online platforms Sona and MTurk. The first group consisted of students recruited for course credit, or the Course Credit group. The second group consisted of paid Master-status Mechanical Turk workers, (the Master MTurkers group), and the third group consisted of paid non-master Mechanical Turk workers (the non-Master MTurkers group). The accuracy of the different groups’ tassel identification was evaluated against an expert-generated gold standard. These crowdsourced labeled images were then used as training data for a “bag-of-features” machine learning algorithm.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10640</offset><text>We found that performance of Master and non-Master MTurkers was not significantly different; however both groups performed better than the Course Credit group. At the same time, using the labeling data from either course credit, MTurk or Master MTurk did not make any significant difference in the performance of the machine learning algorithm when trained on sets generated by any of these groups. We conclude that crowdsourcing via MTurk can be useful for establishing ground truth sets for complex image analysis tasks in a short amount of time, and that MTurkers’ and expert MTurkers’ performance exceed that of students working for course credit. At the same time, perhaps surprisingly, we also show that the differences in labeling quality do not significantly affect the performance of a machine learning algorithm trained by any of the three groups.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>11502</offset><text>Methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>11510</offset><text>Ethics statement</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>11527</offset><text>Research involving human participants was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Iowa State University under protocol 15-653.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>11660</offset><text>Data and software</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>11678</offset><text>The software for this study is available from: https://github.com/ashleyzhou972/Crowdsource-Corn-Tassels</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>11783</offset><text>The data for this study are available from: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.6360236.v2</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>11874</offset><text>General outline</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>11890</offset><text>The overall scheme of the work is depicted in Fig 1.

Recruited students were compensated with course credits. The master MTurkers included 65 master-qualified workers recruited through MTurk. The exact qualifications for master status are not published by Amazon, but are known to include work experience and employer ratings of completed work. Master MTurkers were paid $8.00 to complete the task and the total cost was $572.00. Finally, the non-master MTurkers pool included 66 workers with no qualification restriction, recruited through the Amazon Mechanical Turk website. Due to the nature of Amazon’s MTurk system, it is not possible to recruit only participants who are not master qualified. However, the purpose of including the non-master MTurkers was to evaluate workers recruited without the additional fee imposed by Amazon for recruitment of Masters MTurkers. Non-master MTurkers were also paid $8.00 to complete the task and the total cost was $568.00. Note that the costs include Amazon’s fees. Of the 30 students recruited, 26 completed all 80 images. Of the 65 Master MTurkers recruited, 49 completed all images. Of the 66 non-master MTurkers recruited, 51 completed all images. Data collected from participants who did not complete the survey were not included in subsequent analyses.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>14237</offset><text>Pilot study</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>14249</offset><text>A brief cropping task was initially administered to Sona and master MTurkers groups as a pilot study to test the viability of this project and task instructions. Each participant was presented with a participant-specific set of 40 images randomly chosen from 393 total images. The accuracy of participant labels helped designate Easy and Hard status for each image. Forty images were classified as “easy to crop”, and 40 as “hard to crop”, based on accuracy results of the pilot study. An expert who made gold standard boxes made adjustments to the Easy/Hard classifications based on personal experience. These 80 images were selected for the main study. As opposed to the pilot study, participants in the main study each received the same set of 80 images, with image order randomized separately for each participant. The results of the pilot study indicated that at least 40 images could be processed without evidence of fatigue so the number of images included in the main experiment was increased to 80. The pilot study also indicated, via user feedback, that a compensation rate of $8.00 for the set of 80 images was acceptable to the MTurk participants. To expedite the pilot study, we did not include regular MTurkers. Our rationale was that feasibility for a larger study could be assessed by including master MTurkers and Sona only.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>15599</offset><text>Gold standard</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>15613</offset><text>We define a gold standard box for a given tassel as the box with the smallest area among all bounding boxes that contain the entire tassel, a minimum bounding box.

The field images focused on a single row of corn captured by cameras set up as part of the field phenotyping of the maize Nested Association Mapping, using 456 cameras simultaneously, each camera imaging a set of 6 plants. Each camera took an image every 10 minutes during a two week growing period in August 2015. Some image features varied, for example, due to weather conditions and visibility of corn stalks, but the tassels were always clearly visible. Images were presented on a Qualtrics webpage (www.qualtrics.com) and Javascript was used to provide tassel annotation functionality. After providing Informed Consent, participants viewed a single page with instructions detailing how to identify corn tassels and how to create a minimum bounding box around each tassel. Participants were first shown an example image with the tassels correctly bounded with boxes (Fig 2). Below the example, participants read instructions on how to create, modify, and delete bounding boxes using the mouse. These instructions explained that an ideal bounding box should contain the entire tassel with as little additional image detail as possible. Additional instructions indicated that overlapping boxes and boxes containing other objects would sometimes be necessary and were acceptable as long as each box accurately encompassed the target tassel. Participants were also instructed to only consider tassels in the foreground, ignoring tassels that appear in the background. After reading instructions, participants clicked to progress to the actual data collection. No further feedback or training were provided. The exact instructions are provided in the Supplementary Materials.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">pcbi.1006337.g002.jpg</infon><infon key="id">pcbi.1006337.g002</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_title_caption</infon><offset>17982</offset><text>Example image used during training to demonstrate correct placement of bounding boxes around tassels.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>18084</offset><text>For each image, participants created a unique bounding box for each tassel by clicking and dragging the cursor.

Precision (Pr) is defined as IB/PB, and recall (Rc) is defined as IB/GB. Both Pr and Rc range from a minimum value of 0 (when the participant box and gold standard box fail to overlap) to a maximum value of 1 (full overlap of boxes). As an overall measure of performance for a participant box as an approximation to a gold standard box, we use F1, the harmonic mean of precision and recall:  Each participant-drawn box was matched to the gold standard box that maximized F1 across all gold standard boxes within the image containing the participant box. If more than one participant box was matched to the same gold standard box, the participant box with the highest F1 value was assigned the Pr, Rc, and F1 values for that match, and the other participant boxes matching that same gold standard box were assigned Pr, Rc, and F1 values of zero. In the usual case of a one-to-one matching between participant boxes and gold standard boxes, each participant box was assigned the Pr, Rc, and F1 values associated with its matched gold standard box.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">pcbi.1006337.g003.jpg</infon><infon key="id">pcbi.1006337.g003</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_title_caption</infon><offset>20090</offset><text>Drawing boxes around tassels.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">pcbi.1006337.g003.jpg</infon><infon key="id">pcbi.1006337.g003</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>20120</offset><text>Left: Sample participant-drawn boxes.

The course credit group generally spent less time than either MTurker group. It is worth noting that there is a large variance in time spent on each image, with the longest time for a single image at 15,484.63 seconds, and the shortest being 0.88 seconds.

Similarly, the vertical axis shows the BLUPs with regard to Fmean. Images with higher BLUPs tended to be processed more accurately.

Furthermore, the images that our expert considered difficult did not take participants longer to complete, nor did they yield significantly lower accuracy. The images were shown to participants in a random order, eliminating the possibility that fatigue contributes to the longer time it takes to complete easy images. Since previous analysis showed that participants tend to spend less time on images shown to them later (Fig 5A), this may suggest ordering the images so that more difficult images are shown to the participants first. In that way, a surveyor may take advantage of the fact that participants tend to spend more time on each image in the beginning, to obtain more accurate results.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>28634</offset><text>Evaluating the performance of participant-trained classifiers</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28696</offset><text>Automatic tassel detection is an important prerequisite for fast computation of quantitative traits.

The training images (i.e., boxes) are selected so that each contains either a tassel or no tassel. Each training image is then represented by a vector of frequencies, with one frequency for each feature. The second stage of the algorithm involves training a support vector machines (SVM) classifier using the frequency vectors associated with the training images, as well as the status of each training image: whether it contains a tassel or not. For each of the 126 participants in our study, we constructed a set of training images using the participant-drawn boxes as the positive set (i.e., the training images containing a tassel), together with a constant negative set of 600 images (corresponding to boxes that contain no tassel). The number of training images in the positive set varied across participant, with a median of 457.

However, these algorithms still require an initial training set created by expert individuals before structures can be automatically extracted from the image and labeled. This project has identified crowdsourcing as a viable method for creating initial training sets without the time consuming and costly work of an expert. Our results show that straightforward tasks, such tassel cropping, do not benefit from the extra fee assessed to hire master over non-master MTurkers. Performance between the two groups was not significantly different, and non-master MTurkers can safely be hired without compromising data quality.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>32329</offset><text>The MTurk platform allows for fast collection of data within a day instead of one to two weeks. While MTurk may be one of the most popular crowdsourcing platforms, many universities possess a research participant pool that compensates students with class credit instead of cash for their work. However, in our study the undergraduate student participant pool did not perform as well as either of the MTurker groups. While it is possible that MTurk workers are simply more conscientious than college students, it is also possible that monetary compensation is a better motivator than course credit. In addition to the direct monetary reward, both groups of MTurkers were also motivated by either working towards or maintaining the “master” status. Such implicit motivational mechanisms might be useful in setting up a long-term crowdsourcing platform. The distinction in labeling performance between MTurkers and students does not matter when considering the actual outcome of interest: how well the machine learning algorithm identifies corn tassels when supplied with each of the three training sets. The accuracy of the ML algorithm used here was not affected by the quality of the training set provided, which were manually-labeled through crowdsourcing. Therefore, a student participant pool with a non-monetary rewards system provides the opportunity for an alternate model by lowering overall image tagging cost. This would allow additional features to be tagged or a larger number of responses to be sourced with existing funding levels and further database expansion.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>33909</offset><text>Indeed, there are many crowdsourcing projects that do not offer monetary reward. For example, the Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 project hosted by NASA for search of planets and star systems in space, the Phylo (http://phylo.cs.mcgill.ca/) game for multiple sequence alignment and fold.it (http://fold.it) for protein folding. These projects attract participants by offering the chance to contribute to real scientific research. This concept has been categorized as citizen science, where nonprofessional scientists participate in crowdsourced research efforts. In addition to the attraction of the subject matter, these projects often have interactive and entertaining interfaces to quickly engage the participants’ interests and attention. Some of them were even designed as games, and competition mechanisms such as rankings provide extra motivation. Another important purpose of such citizen science projects is to educate the public about the subject matter. Given the current climate regarding Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs), crowdsourcing efforts of crop phenomic and phenotypic research could potentially be a gateway to a better understanding of plant research in the general public. A recent effort has shown that non-experts can be used for accurate image-based plant phenomics annotation tasks. However, the current data points to the challenge of non-monetary reward in sustaining a large-scale annotation effort.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>35340</offset><text>Phenomics is concerned with the quantitative and qualitative study of phenomes, where all possible traits of a given organism vary in response to genetic mutations and environmental influences. An important field of research in phenomics is the development of high-throughput technology analogous to high-throughput sequencing in genetics and genomic studies, to enable the collection of large-scale data with minimal efforts. Many phenotypic traits could be recorded with images, and databases such as BioDIG make the connection of such image data with genomic information, providing genetics researchers with tools to examine the relationship between the two types of data directly. Hence, the computation and manipulation of such phenomic image data becomes essential. In plant biology, maize is central for both basic biological research as well as crop production (reviewed in). As such, phenotypic information derived from ear (female flowers) and tassel (male flowers) are key to both the study of genetics and crop productivity: flowers are where meiosis and fertilization occur as well as the source of grain. To add a new features such as tassel emergence, size, branch number, branch angle and anthesis to the systems such as BioDIG, the specific tassel location and structure should be located, and our solution to this task is to use crowdsourcing combined with machine learning to reduce cost and time of such a pipeline, while expanding its utility. Our findings, and the suggested crowdsourcing methods can be generally applied to other phenomic analysis tasks. It is worthy to note that differences in quality of training sets may not translate into significant differences in classification, as was in our study. However, this may vary between different classification algorithms, and different training sets. We hope our study will help establish some best practices for researchers in setting up such a crowdsourcing study. Given the ease and relatively low cost of obtaining data through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, we recommend it over the undergraduate research pool.
