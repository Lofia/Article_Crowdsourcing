Automated field size delineation using remote sensing or the estimation of average farm size at subnational level using census data are two approaches that have been used. However, both have limitations, for example, automatic field size delineation using remote sensing has not yet been implemented at a global scale while the spatial resolution is very coarse when using census data. This paper demonstrates a unique approach to quantifying and mapping agricultural field size globally using crowdsourcing. A campaign was run in June 2017, where participants were asked to visually interpret very high resolution satellite imagery from Google Maps and Bing using the Geo‐Wiki application. During the campaign, participants collected field size data for 130 K unique locations around the globe. Using this sample, we have produced the most accurate global field size map to date and estimated the percentage of different field sizes, ranging from very small to very large, in agricultural areas at global, continental, and national levels. The results show that smallholder farms occupy up to 40% of agricultural areas globally, which means that, potentially, there are many more smallholder farms in comparison with the two different current global estimates of 12% and 24%. The global field size map and the crowdsourced data set are openly available and can be used for integrated assessment modeling, comparative studies of agricultural dynamics across different contexts, for training and validation of remote sensing field size delineation, and potential contributions to the Sustainable Development Goal of Ending hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>1981</offset><text>This paper demonstrates a unique approach to quantifying and mapping agricultural field size globally using crowdsourcing.

(2015) published the first global field size map at a 1 km2 resolution, which was generated through interpolation of around 13 K field size samples collected using the Geo‐Wiki crowdsourcing tool. Such an approach was possible as a result of the increasing availability of very high resolution satellite imagery from Google Earth from which agricultural field boundaries could be identified in detail, particularly those of smallholder farms. This field size product generated a considerable amount of interest because spatially explicit information on field size at a global scale is currently lacking. As a consequence, this product was used in a number of studies. For example, Samberg, Gerber, Ramankutty, Herrero, and West (2016) mapped mean agricultural area (MAA) by subnational administrative units for Latin America, Sub‐Saharan Africa, and South and East Asia using household census data, where field size was found to be a significant predictor in the MAA model. Herrero et al. (2017) examined the relationship between farm size, agricultural production, and nutritional diversity where the global field size map was used to allocate agricultural production to different farms sizes at the country level. The results showed that small‐ and medium‐sized farms produce up to 77% of all commodities and nutrients considered, particularly in Sub‐Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and China. The majority of global micronutrients and protein are also produced in more diverse agricultural landscapes, so as farm sizes increase, production diversity must also be maintained to ensure diverse nutrient production.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4278</offset><text>Both of these studies are part of a larger debate on the role of farm size in global food security (Meyfroidt, 2017), where farm size is related to field size (Graesser &amp; Ramankutty, 2017). For example, an overall farm size may not change due to lack of capacity for expansion but a farmer may increase their existing field sizes. Hence, field size is an important indicator of agricultural intensity, for example, to gain a better understanding of management practices, or to monitor biodiversity and landscape fragmentation. Yet, there is considerable uncertainty concerning estimates of the amount of agricultural land within different field size categories, particularly smallholdings. Using census data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Lowder, Skoet, and Raney (2016) estimate that 84% of the 570 million farms globally are &lt;2 ha in size, which represents around 12% of agricultural land. More recently, Ricciardi, Ramankutty, Mehrabi, Jarvis, and Chookolingo (2018) found that farms &lt;2 ha in size occupy 24% of agricultural gross area based on agricultural census data and different surveys from 55 countries. Graeub et al. (2016) estimate that family farms cover 53% of agricultural land but these farms can include field sizes of &gt;2 ha since the definition of family farm is not based on field size. Hence, this number is not directly comparable with Lowder et al. (2016) or Ricciardi et al. (2018). No other estimates exist, and hence, there is a clear need for spatially explicit data on the distribution of field sizes, which can provide an independent estimate to that derived from FAO census data or nationally (or subnationally) representative sample surveys.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5972</offset><text>Another approach to mapping field size is to use remote sensing. For example, Yan and Roy (2016) developed an automated crop field extraction method which they applied to 30 m Web Enabled Landsat data (WELD) time series to produce a wall‐to‐wall field size map for the contiguous USA (Yan &amp; Roy, 2016). Graesser and Ramankutty (2017) developed a semi‐automated approach involving edge extraction and adaptive thresholding to produce a field size map for five countries in South America. Although the results from both studies were good, that is, accuracies of &gt;84%, both of these studies are limited in geographical coverage and concern areas where field sizes are large with a relatively precise geometry (square or round) in comparison with fields in other parts of the world. Therefore, to map fields globally using remote sensing would require adjustment for the high variability of field geometry in places such as Africa as well as considerable processing power.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6948</offset><text>An alternative approach to the use of remote sensing or census‐based spatial disaggregation (Samberg et al., 2016) is the crowdsourcing method outlined originally in Fritz et al. (2015). At the time, around 13 K samples were collected using four categories: very small, small, medium, and large, where the definitions were based on simple rules of thumb to aid visual interpretation rather than area‐based estimates. As field size estimation was not the focus of the campaign, the sample collected was limited in size. A simple interpolation method was then applied to produce the global field size map. Although the general patterns of field size were captured globally, there were numerous artifacts from the interpolation method when viewing the map in more detail, and limitations were recognized at a national level, for example, underestimation of small fields in Argentina (Graesser &amp; Ramankutty, 2017). Hence, there was a clear need to improve this map with a much denser sample and apply a more appropriate interpolation algorithm. To achieve this objective, a new Geo‐Wiki campaign was run in June 2017, focused entirely on the collection of field size data, which increased the density of field size samples by an order of magnitude, that is, around 130 K unique samples were collected. Although crowdsourcing and citizen science are becoming popular ways of collecting data, for example, through the eBird project (Sullivan et al., 2014) or Zooniverse (Reed et al., 2013), assuring data quality still remains the most critical issue in this field (Comber, Mooney, Purves, Rocchini, &amp; Walz, 2016; Fonte et al., 2017; Resnik, Elliott, &amp; Miller, 2015; Salk, Sturn, See, Fritz, &amp; Perger, 2016; See et al., 2013). To address this issue, we have improved the quality control mechanism and introduced field measuring tools to improve the accuracy of the data collected. Hence, with these improvements, it is now also possible to estimate the percentage of different field sizes at a global and continental scale as well as nationally. The aim of this paper was to present the improved global field size map and to compare estimates of different field sizes derived from the field size sample with those currently found in the literature. The field size samples are also available from this site, which can be used for training or validation of automatic field size classification algorithms or identifying priority areas for mapping, for example, where there is a high variability in field sizes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>9458</offset><text>MATERIALS AND METHODS</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9480</offset><text>Figure 1 provides an overview of the main steps undertaken in this study, which includes (a) collection of the global field size data via a crowdsourcing campaign; (b) mapping of the dominant field sizes; (c) estimation of the area percentages of the different field size categories; and (d) comparison of the crowdsourced data with other field size data sets.

Google Maps and Microsoft Bing Maps include mosaics of very high resolution satellite and aerial imagery from different time periods and multiple image providers, from Landsat satellites operated by NASA and USGS to commercial providers such as Digital Globe. More information on the spatial and temporal distribution of very high resolution satellite imagery can be found in Lesiv et al. (2018).

Once completed, the participants were then shown a random location on the Geo‐Wiki interface and were asked the following two questions: (a) what field size categories do you see in the red box; (b) what is the dominant field size, that is, the field size category corresponding to the fields with the highest total area covered in the red box (Figure 2d). The red box represents an area of 16 ha divided into 25 grid cells. If the user selected more than one field size, they were asked to indicate which of these was dominant. The area measuring tool (Figure 2a,b) allows participants to delineate the fields manually to calculate the sizes. Participants were encouraged to quickly do a visual identification of field sizes, without measuring them, using the grid system (Figure 2d), where yellow cells are 80 × 80 m or 0.64 ha, the red box is 400 × 400 m or 16 ha, and the blue box is 1 × 1 km or 100 ha in size.

Alternatively, if either no imagery was available, or if it was deemed too difficult to determine the field sizes, the participant could skip a location (Figure 2g). If a location was skipped because of being too difficult, such a location would still have been available for other participants, whereas in the case of the absence of imagery in both the underlying layers, that is, Google Maps and Microsoft Bing Maps, this location was taken out of the sample of available locations. In the case of Microsoft Bing Maps, the imagery is not complete, which only becomes apparent when you zoom into the maximum extent. In the case of Google Maps, this occurs when there is a lack of very high resolution imagery and you zoom into the maximum extent. If you zoom out, you will see the Landsat base imagery but it will not be possible to identify the field sizes unless they are very large.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>18850</offset><text>Quality assurance</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>18868</offset><text>Insights from our previous crowdsourcing campaigns (Fritz et al., 2012; Laso Bayas et al., 2016) indicated that we needed to invest in the training of the participants, where there were 130 in total.

In this campaign, we provided initial guidelines for the participants in a form of a video and slides that were shown before the participants could start classifying the field sizes (see Supporting information Figure S1). Additionally, the participants were asked to classify 10 training samples before contributing officially to the campaign. They received text‐based feedback on each of these 10 samples including the measured field size categories, with the possibility of watching an explanatory video for each location showing how these field sizes were selected (Videos and explanations available here: https://www.geo-wiki.org/Application/modules/field_size_sigma/FieldSizeSigma_gallery.html).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>20014</offset><text>During the campaign, the participants were shown a sample site that was part of a “control” or expert data set, which appeared randomly during every 10 classifications.

Our hypothesis behind this approach was that by receiving immediate feedback on a submitted classification, a participant would learn from their mistakes and the quality of their work would increase over time.

Since we decided that a control sample site will appear once every 10 classifications, we needed 4,000 control sample sites (40,000/10 = 4,000) in total. The control sample sites were classified by a small group of experts trained by the lead author at IIASA. Each control sample site was classified twice by two different experts.

Moreover, 2.5% of the sample sites were deemed impossible to classify by the participants due to low resolution imagery, clouds or the absence of imagery.

However, to compare these estimates with our results, we consider that a smallholder farm may include many very small fields with an area of &lt;2 ha and a few small fields. Thus, according to our results, smallholder farms occupy a maximum of 40% of total agricultural area, which is considerably larger than the figure of 12% reported in Lowder et al. (2016). The share of smallholder farms is much higher in Asia (~70%) and Africa (up to ~74%), which is considerably higher that estimates provided in Wu et al. (2018, fig 2C), based on the same data as that used by Lowder et al. (2016). In contrast, our results are smaller than the estimate of 60% reported in Cui et al. (2018) but the latter figure cannot be traced to the original cited source so there is huge uncertainty around the veracity of this figure. Our results are closest to the estimate of 24% provided by Ricciardi et al.

It could be used to expand the research study undertaken by Samberg et al. (2016) to the global level as well as enhancing the work on food and nutrient security (Herrero et al., 2017). Since we recorded the dates of the underlying satellite images (Supporting information Figure S2) used in the visual interpretation, this data set may serve as training data for automated classification of field size from remote sensing (although only for field size categories introduced in this study). The temporal reference is crucial in mapping fields as their shape and size change over time due to different socio‐economic factors (Yan &amp; Roy, 2016). Only in the areas with very fragmented or hilly landscapes do field sizes remain small or very small over time, for example, in the mountain region of Italy, the south of China. Additionally, the data set could also guide the choice of which sensor to use for agricultural monitoring and crop type classification, for example, for heterogeneous regions and regions with very small fields, there is a need for a finer resolution sensor such as Sentinel‐2 data at a 10 m resolution.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>38584</offset><text>By interpolating the global field size data set using a method more appropriately suited to the data set, we produced a better global field size map than the previous version (Fritz et al., 2015).

To improve the spatial disaggregation of cropland types, this field size layer could also be used as a covariate in the Spatial Production Allocation Model (SPAM) (You et al., 2014).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>39175</offset><text>This study has also addressed the question of what proportion of agricultural area different field sizes occupy at the global, continental, and country level. Our findings confirm that small fields have a substantial percentage at the global level: very small fields with an area &lt;0.64 ha occupy 23.23% while small fields (with an area between 0.64 and 2.56 ha) occupy 14.47% of total agricultural areas (or 40% in total if we count the bias of 2.5%). Although the comparison with the US field map (Yan &amp; Roy, 2016) showed a 92.2% agreement with the crowdsourced data set, there are no other studies that have calculated the percentage of field sizes at the global level. There are a few studies on the distribution and percentage of different farm sizes but field size and farm size are not the same thing as discussed in the introduction. Moreover, farm sizes cannot be defined by taking only the area of land owned into account (Graeub et al., 2016), as this varies between country. Nevertheless, FAO defines smallholder farms as farms with agricultural areas of &lt;2 ha. Reports on the percentage of smallholder farms in total agricultural areas varie considerably, for example, 12% in Lowder et al. (2016) up to 60% in Cui et al. (2018). Moreover, Lowder et al. (2016) include permanent pastures in their estimates, as we do, while Ricciardi et al. (2018) do not, yet report an estimate of 24% smallholder farms. However, we expect that non‐permanent pastures will have a rather small share in our estimates of area proportions. We did not look at this particular aspect in this study because it would have complicated the task undertaken by the crowd and, consequently, would have increased the uncertainties in our results. If there were an accurate global layer of cropland and permanent pastures, separated from each other, we could have excluded non‐permanent pastures from our calculations and could have estimated area proportions for croplands, for permanent pastures, and for croplands together with permanent pastures. Unfortunately, up to now, the spatial distribution of croplands and pastures derived from remote sensing does not yet meet user requirements for cropland monitoring (Pérez‐Hoyos, Rembold, Kerdiles, &amp; Gallego, 2017). If such layers appear in the near future, the potential users of the field size data set could repeat our approach to estimate area proportions of field sizes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>41593</offset><text>Supporting information</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>41616</offset><text>DATA ACCESSIBILITY</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>41635</offset><text>All the data are of open access.
