As cumulative case counts increase, patient-level health data become a viable and crucial resource for researchers to understand disease patterns and design evidence-based interventions against the disease. Machine learning approaches applied to COVID-19 patient electronic health record (EHR) data have shown value in outbreak prediction, early screening, contact tracing of infected patients, health outcome prediction to improve diagnosis and treatment, and prioritization of health care resources for patients who are at a higher risk for health complications.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4682</offset><text>Patient data must be acknowledged as private and sensitive, and there are appropriate restrictions in place for the sharing of these data, for example, the restrictions enumerated in the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. These necessary restrictions hinder data accessibility for researchers, limiting their ability to develop models and to externally validate their models. In cases where researchers have access to patient health data, models developed by isolated teams with no objective evaluation oversight can lead to self-assessment bias and overfit models.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5269</offset><text>To overcome these challenges, we provided a solution for lowering the accessibility barrier to private patient data, while maintaining privacy protections, by implementing the model-to-data framework, under which investigators can build models on but never have direct access to sensitive health data. Using this infrastructure, we organized a response to the COVID-19 pandemic by launching the COVID-19 EHR DREAM Challenge. The feasibility and utility of this approach was previously demonstrated in the Patient Mortality EHR DREAM Challenge, leading to the unbiased assessment of machine learning models applied to EHRs to predict patient mortality. In our COVID-19 Challenge, we asked participants to address 2 clinically pressing questions. Diagnostic Question 1 (Q1): Of patients who received a test for COVID-19, who will have positive test results? Prognostic Question 2 (Q2): Of patients who have positive test results for COVID-19 in an outpatient setting, who is at risk for hospitalization within 21 days? The questions were motivated by the need to triage patients prior to widespread diagnostic and treatment capabilities. We evaluated models’ performance and generalizability to patient subgroups stratified by age, sex, race, ethnicity, and time of COVID-19 test.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>6550</offset><text>Methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>6558</offset><text>Data</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6563</offset><text>All work was reviewed and approved by the University of Washington (UW) institutional review board and UW Medicine leadership. We curated 2 challenge data sets (diagnostic Q1 challenge data set and prognostic Q2 challenge data set) separately for the purpose of model training and evaluation. The COVID-19 EHR DREAM challenge was run as a continuous benchmarking exercise where the data sets were updated every 2 to 5 weeks to incorporate new patients and update existing patients’ clinical trajectory. The Q1 challenge data set has 6 versions that accumulated over 30 weeks since May 6, 2020, and the Q2 challenge data set has 4 versions over 18 weeks since August 19, 2020. Each data set version was named by the challenge week during which the data set was used (Figure 1A; eAppendices 1 and 2 and eTables 1 and 2 in Supplement 1).

We split the cumulative data set in a way where 50% of patients who most recently underwent testing for COVID-19 were incorporated into the cumulative evaluation data set (patients who underwent testing between July 29, 2020, and January 21, 2021) and the other 50% were incorporated into the cumulative training data set (patients tested between March 2 and July 28, 2020). The cumulative evaluation data set was split evenly and prospectively into 3 subevaluation data sets based on the patients’ COVID-19 measurement date to evaluation 1 (July 29 to September 14, 2020), evaluation 2 (September 15 to November 11, 2020), and evaluation 3 (November 12, 2020, to January 21, 2021).

Challenge participants never had direct access to patient data; instead, they were required to build and submit Dockerized (containerized) models. A synthetic data set was provided to the participants to help them become familiar with the format of the data and to aid in technical debugging. Models submitted by participants would first go through a validation process in an Amazon Web Service cloud environment, running against synthetic data. Once validated, the models would be transferred to the UW environment, training and evaluating on real patient data. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC) were 2 performance metrics we used to assess models.

A logistic regression model with 10-fold cross-validation ingested individual models’ probability for the cumulative evaluation data set to build an ensemble model.

During this challenge, Q1 ran for 30 weeks, with the challenge data set increasing from 9100 patients to 89 600 patients through 6 data updates; Q2 ran for 18 weeks, with the challenge data set increasing from 1700 patients to 2200 patients through 4 data updates. For Q1, the AUROC of the best-performing model was 0.827 and the AUPRC of the best-performing model was 0.303 on the data set version Week 18-21. For Q2, the best AUROC was 0.982 and the best AUPRC was 0.897 for the data set version Week 1-4. However, these scores were observed in the first version of the Q2 challenge data set, which was small, and the top team made multiple submissions in the first 4 weeks, presenting a high risk of overfitting. The best Q2 scores after the first challenge data set version were an AUROC of 0.804 and AUPRC of 0.166 on the data set version Week 9-13 (Figure 2; eFigures 1 and 2 and eTables 6 and 7 in Supplement 1).</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">jamanetwopen-e2124946-g002.jpg</infon><infon key="id">zoi210734f2</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_title_caption</infon><offset>15304</offset><text>Performance of Models Submitted to Challenge Questions During the Challenge</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">jamanetwopen-e2124946-g002.jpg</infon><infon key="id">zoi210734f2</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>15380</offset><text>A, Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of models submitted to question 1 every week.

This finding suggests that hospitalization prediction for patients who underwent testing for COVID-19 during non–outpatient visits, such as patients who were already inpatient for non–COVID-19 health conditions, were more difficult to predict correctly and patient data were noisier and clinically more ambiguous (Figure 5A).</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">jamanetwopen-e2124946-g005.jpg</infon><infon key="id">zoi210734f5</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_title_caption</infon><offset>20995</offset><text>Performance of Question 2 Models in Postchallenge Analysis</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">jamanetwopen-e2124946-g005.jpg</infon><infon key="id">zoi210734f5</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>21054</offset><text>A, Performance of question 2 models for 21-day hospitalization prediction trained on all patients tested for COVID-19 vs only patients tested for COVID-19 in outpatient settings.

We removed EHR records in 30-day increments up to 10 years before patients’ COVID-19 testing date in both the training and evaluation data sets. We found that model performances did not consistently increase as more EHR clinical history was provided, except for Ivanbrugere’s model, which showed increasing performance as more clinical history became available, up to 2-year data (Figure 5B).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>22242</offset><text>Top-Performing Methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>22265</offset><text>We analyzed the top 3 teams’ models for each question to shed light on the features and methods used by participants (eTable 10 in Supplement 1). Model details are included in eAppendix 6 in Supplement 1. The top teams used both a data-driven approach and preselection based on clinical knowledge to select features. Boosting methods were the most popular top-performing algorithms. We asked physicians to review the top features selected by models (eTables 11 and 12 in Supplement 1) to assess if the top features selected by machine learning models were interpretable. Some features appeared to be mechanistically associated with COVID-19, such as loss of smell, cough, fever, and leukocyte count for COVID-19 diagnosis prediction and oxygen saturation, asthma exacerbation diagnosis, acute renal failure, and abnormal coagulation test results for hospitalization prediction. Other features, including serum CO2, hemoglobin and hematocrit, albumin, and edema, were selected by the models but did not have a known connection with COVID-19.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>23308</offset><text>Ensemble Model Performance</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>23335</offset><text>We next developed an ensemble model to assess whether combining models could achieve better performance compared with any single model (see Methods).

When stratifying the ensemble validation data set based on demographic profile, the Q1 ensemble model outperformed the best individual model in 10 of total 13 subgroups significantly (eFigure 4 and eTable 13 in Supplement 1). The Q2 ensemble model, which combined the top 7 teams, reached an AUROC of 0.740 (95% CI, 0.739-0.742) and AUPRC of 0.286, compared with Q2 best individual model’s AUROC of 0.772 (95% CI, 0.771-0.774) and AUPRC of 0.193.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>24263</offset><text>Discussion</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>24274</offset><text>In most common research cases, access to patient data is restricted to researchers affiliated with health institutions and the turnaround time to have projects reviewed by institutional review boards can often lead to a delay between the data being available and the study being conducted. These delays and barriers yield missed opportunities for research and impact in time-critical scenarios such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Our citizen science challenge provided a paradigm for sharing up-to-date patient data with those who otherwise would not have access to that data. In this challenge, 482 participants from 7 countries were engaged in training predictive models that could aid clinical decisions and alleviate clinical burden as the COVID-19 pandemic overwhelmed health care institutions. We conducted prospective evaluation and subpopulation analysis of models we received during the postchallenge study. After this study, we will continue operating the platform to support the evaluation of methods on challenge data sets.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>25305</offset><text>We launched 2 questions in this challenge for predicting COVID-19 test results and hospitalization to assess performance of methods, to replicate results from other sites, and to identify key features for prediction. These 2 questions were most suitable for the beginning of the pandemic when test supplies and hospital resources needed to be prioritized. With this continuous benchmarking platform constructed, computational resources provisioned, and hundreds of data scientists engaged, we can point these resources at the next urgent question such as predictions of COVID-19 mortality risk, vaccine effectiveness, and the long-term effects of COVID-19.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>25962</offset><text>We improved this EHR DREAM challenge from a previously fixed data set and time-limited submission quota to data sets that were updated and interrogated over time. The successful operation of the continuous benchmarking challenge demonstrated the flexibility and scalability of the model-to-data approach. This approach proved to have 3 benefits: (1) it protected the patient data while enabling model development on private data; (2) it forced model developers to standardize their models, enabling model transferability and reproducibility for rigorous evaluation; and (3) it enabled an unbiased third party to evaluate these standardized models on previously unseen data.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>26636</offset><text>We saw performance degradation on the temporally evolving data set, indicating limitations in the models’ generalizability on prospective data. However, this performance degradation was expected, given the rapid changes to the challenge data set caused by ever-changing clinical practice and variance in age distribution and prevalence of COVID-19–positive individuals. We observed better model performance in the female group compared with the male group, which could be owing to more female patients than male patients and more EHR history data for the female patients in the cumulative data set. We observed that model performance for the 25- to 49-year-old age group was the best and for the age group 17 years or younger was the worst among all age groups. This finding was consistent with the number of patients in the 2 age groups, in that the 25- to 49-year-old group was the largest and the group 17 years or younger was the smallest. However, with White patients making up most of the data set, the model performance on the White group was not always better than the other race groups, indicating that COVID-19 diagnosis prediction for White patients was difficult even with more training samples for race. We also identified that top teams could have inferior model performance on some subpopulations compared with other teams who ranked lower. This finding could be ameliorated with a model ensemble based on the strength of each team to maximize prediction accuracy. The Q1 ensemble model outperformed the best individual model in most demographic subgroups.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28212</offset><text>The high-performing models we received in the challenge indicate potential clinical utility.

The continuous benchmarking challenge in itself has led to the identification of several limitations. Data quality was difficult to maintain with regular updates. Data duplicates existed in some versions of the challenge data set. In addition, compared with conventional challenges that have a fixed time frame, models were more at risk of overfitting to the data as the number of allowed submissions increased over time. We also noticed that challenge models may be biased against 1 or more subpopulations, and it is not always the case that this is caused by the training data size; it could be caused by cultural and behavioral differences and requires further investigation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>29300</offset><text>Conclusions</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>29312</offset><text>We succeeded in operating a continuous benchmarking challenge to share up-to-date COVID-19 EHR patient data with a worldwide data science community. The benchmarking challenge provided an unbiased evaluation of models submitted by participants. Top models achieved high accuracy in predicting COVID-19 diagnosis results and hospitalization, indicating potential for clinical implementation. Across submitted models, we observed discrepancies of performance in this temporally evolving data set and among demographic subpopulations (sex, age, race, and ethnicity), indicating the existence of potential bias in machine learning approaches, which warrants attention prior to implementation of such models in clinical practice.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>30037</offset><text>References</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="type">ref</infon><offset>30048</offset><text>Coronavirus in the U.S.: latest map and case count.
