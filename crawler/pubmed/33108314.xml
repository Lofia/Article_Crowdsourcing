With cases mounting in the United States over the past month and with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and many local governments issuing safety measures including social distancing and cleanliness guidelines, the public has had to adapt to a new way of life. However, these drastic changes may have a tremendous psychosocial impact.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1877</offset><text>The public’s perception of this pandemic’s severity may also impact adherence to CDC guidelines or regionally mandated quarantine, and suboptimal adherence to guidelines may have a detrimental effect on attempts to curb the continued spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is well known across many chronic health conditions (asthma or cardiovascular disease) and screening health tools such as colonoscopy and mammography that patient’s perception of severity or risk may directly correlate with adherence to treatment and guidelines. It is thus important to survey the public’s perception of the pandemic’s severity and its psychosocial impact across age, sex, and individual risk factors.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>2576</offset><text>Methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>2584</offset><text>Cross-Sectional Study</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2606</offset><text>A prospective cross-sectional study of random volunteers recruited through an internet crowdsourcing service, Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), was conducted. Study participants were recruited and performed the survey on March 24, 2020. Individuals were required to be older than 18 years and registered through the Amazon service platform within the United States to prevent workers from taking the same survey multiple times or from outside the United States, and the survey was not advertised. Internet crowdsourcing is a powerful tool in its ability to quantify the perceptions and opinions of a diverse group of individuals that may otherwise be inaccessible through other surveying methodologies at a fraction of the cost. Several studies have shown that the participant population is extremely representative of the United States internet population, with 70%-80% of all workers originating and recording responses from the continental United States. In this study, 100% of the workers were from the United States, as an Internet Protocol filter and registration filter were used to guarantee US response. Workers were provided with a compensation of US $0.25 per response (limit one per worker) and were screened by the platform for attentiveness to detail and completeness. Using the MTurk platform to administer surveys significantly reduces cost, response time, inaccuracy, and barriers to access for specific patient populations, providing a more holistic snapshot of the overall US population.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4111</offset><text>Responses were crowdsourced for a 5-minute open survey that collected data on several themes: opinions on travel, CDC guidelines and adherence, ethical concerns, resource use, proactive actions, social distancing, and public perception of several facets of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States (Multimedia Appendix 1). Regarding the public perception of severity, concern, and financial impact, study participants were asked to provide a utility score on a 10 cm vertical visual analog scale (VAS) between 0 cm-10 cm, with the scale described in detail for each question to maximize clarity of the scale being used. All collected utility scores were analyzed across age, sex, household income, and individual health risk factors such as the presence of chronic comorbidities. Questionnaire items were not randomized, and adaptive questions were used to reduce the number and complexity of survey questions. There were 2-12 questionnaire items per page, and the survey was distributed over 11 pages. Participants were able to review and change their answers. Only completed surveys were analyzed, and completeness was assessed after all surveys were collected.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5277</offset><text>Institutional review board approval was not sought or necessary for this study, as in the case of MTurk, no identifiable private or personal information was recorded and no direct interaction or engagement with any of the study participants occurred.

Categorical data was evaluated using chi-square testing.

Older individuals are at a higher risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 infection, and their perception of the crisis was demonstrably more severe than that of the younger population (aged &lt;40 years). Males were less concerned than females regarding the severity of the pandemic and were less likely to practice social distancing. Although there is no established difference in sex with regard to susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, there is limited epidemiological data to suggest increased burden of morbidity and mortality in males. The role of differences in perceived severity of the pandemic and social distancing practices between males and females may contribute to this increased susceptibility because males may underestimate the threat of COVID-19 and engage less rigorously in social distancing.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>31238</offset><text>The mental health implications of social distancing were greatest for younger people despite being at lower risk of morbidity and mortality as compared to older people. As social distancing has resulted in many social interactions becoming confined to the internet, it would be expected that younger people would be least affected by this transition, as younger generations are commonly more adept at using technology and traditionally more associated with the use of social media as a component of their social interactions. However, it may be possible that, because younger people experience a greater proportion of online interactions, they may place a larger relative value on in-person interactions than do older individuals. Because social distancing has resulted in a quick and dramatic reduction of in-person interactions, this may have disproportionately affected younger people. It is also possible that younger people are less likely to live with others when compared to those 40 years or older. This would mean that, during this period of social distancing when people are largely confined to their homes, young people are disproportionately isolated compared to older people. However, information regarding cohabitants was not collected in this survey. The larger negative mental health impact due to social distancing observed in younger people may also be due to their arguably greater potential loss of income. Interestingly enough, there was no significant difference observed between income groups, so financial factors alone cannot explain the fear and emotional toll that younger individuals are reportedly experiencing.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>32879</offset><text>Though it was expected that high-risk individuals would perceive this pandemic as more severe than low-risk individuals, no significant difference was observed. Higher severity VAS scores were anticipated among high-risk participants because, by definition, they are at elevated risk for morbidity and mortality from infection. It is possible that a portion of high-risk individuals are not aware of their augmented risk or that a portion of low-risk individuals mistakenly believe they are at elevated risk. The collected data indicates that the public may be misevaluating the threat of morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. It is conceivable that this misalignment between perceived and actual threat may lead to noncompliance with guidelines, especially if one believes their risk to be less than it actually is. This may also lead to a disproportionate hoarding of resources among those at lower risk relative to those at higher risk and may have needless deleterious effect on mental health, especially if one believes their risk to be greater than it actually is.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>33949</offset><text>The data collected here suggests that younger people believe the US government has responded to this crisis inappropriately while older people appear to be more supportive of the government’s actions. However, the mean VAS response for all age groups was less than 6.0 (scale from 0-10), suggesting that approval of government response is low regardless of age. Although all age groups indicated concern regarding their personal finances, this concern did not differ between age groups. However, older individuals appear to be more concerned about the United States and global economy than are younger people.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>34561</offset><text>Though many may think they know what practices to adopt to prevent viral spread, many participants said that if they were infected they would not wear a mask in public. This indicates that the public may be largely unaware of their lack in knowledge regarding the transmissibility of COVID-19 or that they are indifferent to contributing to the spread of COVID-19. Additionally, although many participants assumed that they knew how to minimize viral spread, they also assumed that others did not, and the degree to which they were confident in their own ability to reduce viral spread was significantly greater than the degree to which they believed other people could contribute to minimizing viral transmission. This may make disseminating accurate information and changing deleterious practices more difficult, as the data here suggests people are likely to think they are engaging in safe behavior when they might not be and that they believe their behavior is appropriate, while the actions of others are not.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>35577</offset><text>Although hoarding practices are widely known to be disruptive to care, many admitted they would purchase unneeded materials and medicines despite the deleterious impact on public health. Furthermore, though the majority stated they have enough essential supplies for themselves and family, less than half believed there were enough essential resources for everyone, and the majority believed that people do not account for the needs of others when securing essential resources. This data suggests that possibly underlying hoarding behavior is a fear of the finiteness of resources and a lack of trust in others to responsibly ration.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>36211</offset><text>Interestingly, though the spread of COVID-19 across boarders has been in part attributed to travel, of those with travel plans both foreign and domestic, 40%-60% planned to continue travelling. This may be indicative of a fatigue created by social distancing that, due to a newly imposed relative isolation, people are wanting to travel despite the risks of contracting and spreading viral infection. This may also reflect the need to travel to self-isolate with family and loved ones, rather than to do so alone. There may also be a nonnegligible portion of the population that remains unaware of the effect of travelling on viral spread.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>36851</offset><text>Limitations</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>36863</offset><text>Although crowdsourcing is an extremely powerful tool, limitations exist. The potential limitation of using Amazon MTurk may be that study participants could submit multiple survey responses. Individuals could also circumvent the survey process completely by using a random number generator to create survey completion codes that are required for study participants to claim their wages. However, this did not have any impact on the overall study results, as all surveys were screened for completeness, quality, uniqueness, and accuracy, and duplicated responses were excluded. In addition, all completion codes were screened for authenticity, and time from survey start to survey completion was measured.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>37568</offset><text>Inherent to many surveying methodologies, there also exists an internal bias with respect to those individuals who choose to take a survey about COVID-19.

The financial interest of the study participants may pose another potential limitation, yet the authors believe that this does not significantly skew the study results, with participants being compensated a total of US $0.25 for their response. In addition, the questions within the survey are not easily influenced by personal financial gain. However, MTurk remains a powerful platform in its ability to crowdsource an accurate representation of the US population as demonstrated by our demographic data being extremely similar to the data published in 2019 by the US Census Bureau.

This study helps to elucidate some of the public’s fears about this disease as well as several key areas where better education may help improve outcomes. Namely, there needs to be a targeted effort to inform those that are infected about the importance of isolation and personal protective equipment. Furthermore, efforts should target hoarding practices and travel. Age-related differences in the perception of severity may change with time, and there is no good intervention to prevent these at this time. The emotional toll will be great, and the negative impact on mental health may continue to increase, especially in the younger population, though the long-term effects of this pandemic will be difficult to predict. Campaigns to target those in need of mental health resources now may curb the long-term negative mental health effects of this pandemic. In the future, this study will be repeated to evaluate how perception has changed over time and to better determine the long-term effects on the general population. Several efforts have already been made to continue to understand public opinions across race and ethnicity.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon
