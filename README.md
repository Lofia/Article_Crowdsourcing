# Todos
1. Add the commentary to these articles (e.g., XYZ, XYZ2) as shown in the examples below.  Example 1: Due to lack of standards, the quality of crowdsourced data varies, as noted in the commentary by XYZ. Example 2: Recent applications can be found in XYZ2 on ..... 

2. Check the references he suggested. Ziyu yao suggested to focus on DBs who have public APIs or reuse existing datasets. Some useful resources to consider:
- arXivâ€™s open API: https://arxiv.org/help/bulk_data (w/ Kaggle dataset etc.)
- **Some medical domain DB APIs: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/textmining/**
- Microsoft Academic Graph: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/open-academic-graph/ (A well-known project but not sure if it is helpful to you)
 
Also some papers which have collected similar datasets and you may check whether their tools are open-source:
- https://blender.cs.illinois.edu/paper/COVIDKG.pdf (might be useful for converting xml files)
- **https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-srw.30.pdf**
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.00176.pdf
